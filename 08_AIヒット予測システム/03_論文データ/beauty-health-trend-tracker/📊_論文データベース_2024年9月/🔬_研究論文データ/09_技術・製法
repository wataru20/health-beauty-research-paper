      "title": "Design of liposomes as drug delivery system for therapeutic applications.",
      "abstract": "Liposomes are spherical vesicles consisting of one or more concentric phospholipid bilayers enclosing an aqueous core. Being both nontoxic and biodegradable, liposomes represent a powerful delivery system for several drugs. They have improved the therapeutic efficacy of drugs through stabilizing compounds, overcoming obstacles to cellular and tissue uptake and increasing drug biodistribution to target sites in vivo, while minimizing systemic toxicity. This review offers an overview of liposomes, thought the exploration of their key fundamentals. Initially, the main design aspects to obtain a successful liposomal formulation were addressed, following the techniques for liposome production and drug loading. Before application, liposomes required an extensive characterization to assurance in vitro and in vivo performance. Thus, several properties to characterize liposomes were explored, such as size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, shape, lamellarity, phase behavior, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug release. Topics related with liposomal functionalization and effective targeting strategies were also addressed, as well as stability and some limitations of liposomes. Finally, this review intends to explore the current market liposomes used as a drug delivery system in different therapeutic applications.",

      "abstract": "In nanoparticle (NP)-mediated drug delivery, liposomes are the most widely used drug carrier, and the only NP system currently approved by the FDA for clinical use, owing to their advantageous physicochemical properties and excellent biocompatibility. Recent advances in liposome technology have been focused on bioconjugation strategies to improve drug loading, targeting, and overall efficacy. In this review, we highlight recent literature reports (covering the last five years) focused on bioconjugation strategies for the enhancement of liposome-mediated drug delivery. These advances encompass the improvement of drug loading/incorporation and the specific targeting of liposomes to the site of interest/drug action. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of bioconjugation strategies in liposome systems currently being evaluated for clinical use and a forward-looking discussion of the field of liposomal drug delivery.",

Though the method of using liposomes has been known since 1960s, and major developments and commercialization of liposomal formulations took place in the late nineties (or early part of this century), newer methods of liposome synthesis and drug encapsulation continue to be an active area of research. With the developments in related fields, such as electrohydrodynamics and microfluidics, and a growing understanding of the mechanisms of lipid assembly from colloidal and intermolecular forces, liposome preparation techniques have been enriched and more predictable than before. This has led to better methods that can also scale at an industrial production level. In this review, we present several novel methods that were introduced over the last decade and compare their advantages over conventional methods. Researchers beginning to explore liposomal formulations will find this resource useful to give an overall direction for an appropriate choice of method. Where possible, we have also provided the known mechanisms behind the preparation methods.",

      "title": "Analytical characterization of liposomes and other lipid nanoparticles for drug delivery.",
      "abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles, especially liposomes and lipid/nucleic acid complexed nanoparticles have shown great success in the pharmaceutical industry. Their success is attributed to stable drug loading, extended pharmacokinetics, reduced off-target side effects, and enhanced delivery efficiency to disease targets with formidable blood-brain or plasma membrane barriers. Therefore, they offer promising formulation options for drugs limited by low therapeutic indexes in traditional dosage forms and current \"undruggable\" targets. Recent development of siRNA, antisense oligonucleotide, or the CRISPR complex-loaded lipid nanoparticles and liposomal vaccines also shed light on their potential in enabling versatile formulation platforms for new pharmaceutical modalities. Analytical characterization of these nanoparticles is critical to drug design, formulation development, understanding in vivo performance, as well as quality control. The multi-lipid excipients, unique core-bilayer structure, and nanoscale size all underscore their complicated critical quality attributes, including lipid species, drug encapsulation efficiency, nanoparticle characteristics, product stability, and drug release. To address these challenges and facilitate future applications of lipid nanoparticles in drug development, we summarize available analytical approaches for physicochemical characterizations of lipid nanoparticle-based pharmaceutical modalities. Furthermore, we compare advantages and challenges of different techniques, and highlight the promise of new strategies for automated high-throughput screening and future development.",

Constituted mainly of a low-melting lipid and a high-melting lipid together with cholesterol, these liposomes maintain stable Janus configuration at room temperature as a result of lipid liquid-liquid phase separation. Local placement of enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase is realized via affinity binding between avidin and biotin, the latter as a lipid conjugate sorted specifically into one domain of these Janus liposomes as a minor component. In the presence of the substrate, hydrogen peroxide, these enzyme-decorated Janus liposomes undergo directional motion, yielding velocities exceeding thermal diffusion by three folds in some cases. Experimental details on liposome size control, motor assembly, and substrate distribution are presented; effects of key experimental factors on liposome motion, such as substrate concentration and liposome Janus ratio, are also examined. This work thus provides a viable approach to building asymmetrical lipid-assembled, enzyme-attached colloids and, in addition, stresses the importance of asymmetry in achieving particle directional motion.",

There is currently no definitive cure for LSD, and despite the approval of certain therapies, their effectiveness is limited. Therefore, an appropriate nanocarrier could help improve the efficacy of some of these therapies. Liposomes show excellent properties as drug carriers, because they can entrap active therapeutic compounds offering protection, biocompatibility, and selectivity. Here, we discuss the potential of liposomes for LSD treatment and conduct a detailed analysis of promising liposomal formulations still in the preclinical development stage from various perspectives, including treatment strategy, manufacturing, characterization, and future directions for implementing liposomal formulations for LSD.",

      "abstract": "The impetuous development of nanotechnology over the past two decades has enabled the production of a plethora of nanomaterials with outstanding optical, magnetic, electrical, catalytic and mechanical properties. The versatility of these materials attracted attention from the very beginning in the most disparate sectors of science and technology. The application of nanomaterials in the biological and biomedical fields soon benefited from the interaction with liposomes, which increased their biocompatibility and biostability. Liposomes indeed are versatile self-assembling supramolecular (nano)structures constituted of an aqueous core enclosed by a lipid bilayer, able to host hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo, and with superior biocompatibility and great similarity with the biological membranes. The result is the construction of hybrid nanoscale architectures, in which nanoparticles (NPs) are allocated either in the aqueous core, in the palisade of the lipid bilayer or on the outer surface of the vesicles. In the first part of this review, the principal methods for the preparation of NP-loaded liposomes are carefully illustrated in a tutorial manner. In the second part, an overview of the great potentialities deriving from the conjugation of liposomes with NPs is presented. In each paragraph, the main characteristics of the most notable classes of NPs, the related issues, and the advantages arising from their association with liposomes are shown. Here, the most significant research works in literature for each kind of system are presented.",

The chemical similarities between naturally occurring exosomes and synthetic liposomes have accelerated the development of exosome mimetics as a therapeutic drug delivery platform under physiological and pathological environments. To maximise the applications of exosomes and liposomes in the clinical setting, it is essential to look into their basic chemical properties and utilise these characteristics to optimise the preparation, loading, modification and hybridisation. This review summarises the chemical and biological properties of both exosomal and liposomal systems as well as some of the challenges related to their production and application.

Liposomes are a better and more significant nanocarrier for cancer therapy.

Several traditional and novel liposome preparation methods are briefly discussed in this mini-review. The current state of liposome targeting, active and passive liposome targeting in cancer therapy, ligand directed targeting (antibody, aptamer, and protein/peptide-mediated targeting), and other miscellaneous approaches such as stimuli-responsive liposome-based targeting, autophagy inhibition mediated targeting, and curcumin loaded liposomal targeting are all discussed within. All of this gathered and compiled information will shed new light on liposome targeting strategies in cancer treatment and will pique the interest of aspiring researchers and academicians.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative disease of the joints, causing significant disability and socio-economic burden in the aging population. Simultaneously, however, it is a common occurrence in younger individuals, initiated by joint injuries or obesity alongside other factors. Intravenous and oral pharmaceutical OA management have both been associated with systemic adverse effects, thereby resulting in a growing interest in intra-articular (IA) treatment. IA-administered drugs circumvent the requirement for high dosage, offering immediate access to the site of interest while minimizing any unfavorable effects. Nonetheless, IA-injected drugs, administered in their free form, present low retention time in the knee joint raising the need for multiple injection dosage regimens, while their capability to target the cartilage or specific cell populations is limited. Liposomes, due to their unique characteristics and tunable nature, have proven to be excellent candidates for the management of knee OA. This review explores the last decade's research on the efficacy of various IA liposomal formulations, investigating their multifaceted properties as pharmaceutical carriers, lubricating agents, and a basis for combinatorial approaches paving the way to novel treatment solutions for OA.",

This review provides an overview on the latest advances of metal complex-based liposomal delivery systems. First, the development of metal complex-mediated liposomal encapsulation is briefly introduced. Next, applications of metal complex-based liposomes in a variety of fields are overviewed, where drug delivery, cancer imaging (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), and cancer therapy (chemotherapy, phototherapy, and radiotherapy) were involved. Moreover, the potential toxicity, action of toxic mechanisms, immunological effects of metal complexes as well as the advantages of metal complex-liposomes in this content are also discussed. In the end, the future expectations and challenges of metal complex-based liposomes in clinical cancer therapy are tentatively proposed.",

      "abstract": "Biofilm formation by pathogenic microorganisms has been a tremendous challenge for antimicrobial therapies due to various factors. The biofilm matrix sequesters bacterial cells from the exterior environment and therefore prevents antimicrobial agents from reaching the interior. In addition, biofilm surface extracellular polymeric substances can absorb antimicrobial agents and thus reduce their bioavailability. To conquer these protection mechanisms, liposomes have been developed into a drug delivery system for antimicrobial agents against biofilm-mediated infections. The unique characteristics of liposomes, including versatility for cargoes, target-specificity, nonimmunogenicity, low toxicity, and biofilm matrix-/cell membrane-fusogenicity, remarkably improve the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents and minimize recurrence of infections.

These phenomena can limit duration of effect and cause toxicity. Targeting the rate-limiting step in drug release from liposomes, we modify (aromatized) them to have aromatic groups within their lipid bilayers. Aromatized liposomes are designed with synthetic phospholipids with aromatic groups covalently conjugated onto acyl chains. The optimized aromatized liposome increases drug loading and significantly decreases the burst release of a broad range of payloads (small molecules and macromolecules, different degrees of hydrophilicity) and extends their duration of release. Aromatized liposomes encapsulating the anesthetic tetrodotoxin (TTX) achieve markedly prolonged effect and decreased toxicity in an application where liposomes are used clinically: local anesthesia, even though TTX is a hydrophilic small molecule which is typically difficult to encapsulate. Aromatization of lipid bilayers can improve the performance of liposomal drug delivery systems.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Ozodrop® and Ozodrop® gel, commercial names of ozonated oil in liposomes plus hypromellose, on eradication and de novo formation of biofilms on different supports, such as plastic plates and contact lens. Our results demonstrate that ozonated liposomal sunflower oil plus hypromellose have an excellent inhibitory effect on bacterial viability and on both de novo formation and eradication of biofilms produced on plates and contact lens by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, we show that Ozodrop® formulations stimulate expression of antimicrobial peptides and that Ozodrop® gel has a strong repair activity on human epithelial cells, suggesting further applications for the treatment of non-healing infected wounds.",

      "abstract": "To improve liposomes' usage as drug delivery vehicles, cryoprotectants can be utilized to prevent constituent leakage and liposome instability. Cryoprotective agents (CPAs) or cryoprotectants can protect liposomes from the mechanical stress of ice by vitrifying at a specific temperature, which forms a glassy matrix. The majority of studies on cryoprotectants demonstrate that as the concentration of the cryoprotectant is increased, the liposomal stability improves, resulting in decreased aggregation. The effectiveness of CPAs in maintaining liposome stability in the aqueous state essentially depends on a complex interaction between protectants and bilayer composition. Furthermore, different types of CPAs have distinct effective mechanisms of action; therefore, the combination of several cryoprotectants may be beneficial and novel attributed to the synergistic actions of the CPAs. In this review, we discuss the use of liposomes as drug delivery vehicles, phospholipid-CPA interactions, their thermotropic behavior during freezing, types of CPA and their mechanism for preventing leakage of drugs from liposomes.",

      "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy is a big challenge, and seeking an effective and safe drug is a pressing clinical need. Gambogic acid is a potent antineoplastic agent without the drawback of bone marrow suppression. To improve its druggability (e.g., poor water solubility and tumor delivery), a lactoferrin-modified gambogic acid liposomal delivery system (LF-lipo) was developed to enhance the treatment efficacy of CRC. The LF-lipo can specifically bind LRP-1 expressed on colorectal cancer cells to enhance drug delivery to the tumor cells and yield enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The LF-lipo promoted tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in tumor cells, and inhibited angiogenesis; moreover, it could also repolarize tumor-associated macrophages from the M2 to M1 phenotype and induce ICD to activate T cells, exhibiting the capability of remodeling the tumor immune microenvironment. The liposomal formulation yielded an efficient and safe treatment outcome and has potential for clinical translation.",

      "abstract": "Lateral phase heterogeneity in biomembranes can govern cellular functions and may serve as a platform for enrichment or depletion of membrane-anchored molecules. In this work, we address the question of how the process of membrane fusion is affected by the membrane phase state (fluid or gel) and by phase coexistence, as well as the effects of fusion-mediated incorporation of exogeneous lipids on phase separation. Our system is based on the fusion of cationic fluid large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of dioleoyl trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) and dioleoyl phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) with neutral and anionic giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. By changing the lipid composition of the GUVs, we modulated the phase state and charge of the different phases (charged or neutral, fluid or gel) and identified systems in which we can target fusion to specific domains on phase-separated membranes. Fusion efficiency was quantified using fluorescence microscopy-based lipid and content mixing assays, and flow chamber devices were used to assess the real-time sequence of events of the fusion process. To investigate the bilayer thermal behavior, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on LUVs. The results show that fusion is extensive in single-component GUVs only for fluid and negatively charged acceptor membranes. On the other hand, in phase-separated GUVs, high fusion efficiency was observed even when the gel phase was anionic and phase separation somewhat increased the fusion efficiency. Extensive fusion led to dissolution of the gel domains as a result of extensive incorporation of lipids in the fluid state from the fusogenic liposomes. Altogether, these findings have the potential to unravel the important role of membrane phase state, phase separation, charge, and the effects of extensive fusion on membrane organization and may give insights in the regulation of the interactions between cells and liposomes that are used in drug delivery systems.",

To tackle those issues, liposomal nanovesicles for phytochemical delivery are taken into consideration for improving the therapeutic effectiveness by increasing transportation across cell barriers and conferring attractive cancer-specific targeting capabilities. In the present review, the liposomal approaches of anticancer phytochemicals are discussed, and recent advances in these formulations applied to cancer phytotherapy are further reviewed by an informed approach.",

      "abstract": "Liposomes represent important drug carrier vehicles in biological systems. A fusogenic liposomal system composed of equimolar mixtures of the cationic lipid DOTAP and the phospholipid DOPE showed high fusion and delivery efficiencies with cells and lipid vesicles. However, aspects of the thermodynamics involving the interaction of these fusogenic liposomes and biomimetic systems remain unclear. Here, we investigate the fusion of this system with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of the zwitterionic lipid POPC and increasing fractions of the anionic lipid POPG and up to 30 mol % cholesterol. The focus here is to concomitantly follow changes in size, zeta-potential, and enthalpy binding upon membrane interaction and fusion. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data showed that membrane fusion in our system is an exothermic process in the absence of cholesterol, suggesting that electrostatic attraction is the driving force for fusion. An endothermic component appeared and eventually dominated the titration at 30 mol % cholesterol, which we propose is caused by membrane fluidification when cholesterol is diluted upon fusion. The inflection points of the ITC data occurred around 0.5-0.7 POPG/DOTAP for all systems, the same stoichiometry for which zeta-potential and dynamic light scattering measurements showed an increase in size coupled with charge neutralization of the system, which is consistent with the fact that fusion in our system is charge-mediated. Microscopy observations of the final mixtures revealed the presence of giant vesicles, which is a clear indication of fusion, coexisting with intermediate-sized objects that could be the result of both fusion and/or aggregation. The results show that the fusion efficiency of the DOTAP:DOPE fusogenic system is modulated by the charge and membrane packing of the acceptor membrane and explain why the system fuses very efficiently with cells.",

We demonstrated that NP and TNP systems react differently to addition of precise length oligohistidines and showcase the effects of alternating spatial arrangements of targeting and endosomolytic elements. The results established that these elements act cooperatively and must be incorporated as individual moieties, rather than a single multifunctional moiety, for optimal internalization by target cells.",

However, the conventional liposomes lack stability during storage and are weak in targeted absorption in the gastrointestinal track. At present, surface modification has been approved to be an effective platform to shield these barricades and help liposomes deliver the agents safely and effectively to the ideal site. In this review, the gastrointestinal stability of conventional liposomes, cargo release models from liposomes, and the biological fate of the core materials after release were emphasized. Then, the strategies in both physical and chemical perspectives to improve the stability and utilization of liposomes in the gastrointestinal tract, and the emerging approaches for improving gut targeting by specifically modified liposomes and the intestinal receptors relative to liposomes/cargos absorption were highlighted. Last but not the least, the safety, challenges, and opportunities for the improvement of liposomal bioavailability were also discussed to inspire new applications of liposomes as oral carriers.",

      "title": "Avoiding artifacts in liposome leakage measurements via cuvette- and liposome-surface modifications.",
      "abstract": "The barrier properties of lipid membranes are often determined by investigating their solute permeability with the help of spectroscopic methods and the use of liposome-encapsulated self-quenching fluorescent dyes, for example, Carboxyfluorescein (CF). It was shown previously that liposome-surface interactions, and thus the choice of cuvette material, influence the result of such spectroscopic permeability/leakage experiments. In this work, we explore different methods to minimize the artifacts observed in spontaneous leakage measurements performed with cholesterol-containing liposomes. The spontaneous leakage of CF from liposomes with different composition and surface properties is monitored in cuvettes composed of quartz, polystyrene (PS), and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Our results show that significantly different leakage profiles are recorded for the exact same liposome batch depending on the cuvette material used. Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) experiments indicate that these discrepancies likely arise from side processes occurring at the solution-cuvette interface, mainly, the attaching and spreading of liposomes. Further, we show that in some cases it is possible to minimize liposome-cuvette interactions, and reduce the experimental artifacts, by supplementing the liposomes with polyethylene glycol (PEG)-grafted lipids or gangliosides, and/or by pre-adsorbing free PEG to the cuvette walls. The collected data suggest that quartz cuvettes modified by adsorption of PEG8000 are suitable for spontaneous leakage experiments with POPC:cholesterol-based liposomes, while other cuvette materials perform poorly in the same experiments.",

Lichens have been deeply investigated for their phytochemical properties and, to date, numerous compounds (also known as substances) have been successfully isolated from the extracts. However, the low solubility and bioavailability of pure lichen substances have been widely recognized as significant issues hindering their biological applications. Recently, several groups have investigated the properties and the potential applications of lichen metabolites-based liposomal formulations and revealed a substantial improvement in their solubility, bioactivity, and toxicity in the animal. Thus, in this topical review, we aimed to provide an overview of liposomal structures, the efficacy of liposomal formulations, as well as their beneficial effects as compared to the free compounds themselves.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of death worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype which is the most challenging to treat. Due to heterogeneity and a lack of specific molecular targets, small molecule-based chemotherapy is the preferred course of treatment. However, these drugs have high toxicity due to off-target effects on healthy tissues, and tumors may develop resistance. Here, we present a polyethylene glycol-modified nanoscale liposomal formulation (LipoRV) of a new anthraquinone derivative which has potent effects on multiple TNBC cell lines. LipoRV readily inhibited the cell cycle, induced cell apoptosis, and reduced long-term proliferative potential of TNBC cells. In a xenograft animal model, LipoRV successfully cleared tumors and demonstrated a good safety profile, without detrimental effects on biochemical markers. Finally, RNA sequencing of LipoRV-treated TNBC cells was carried out, indicating that LipoRV may have immunomodulatory properties. These findings demonstrate that a liposomal anthraquinone-based molecule has excellent promise for TNBC therapy in the future.",

Therefore, it is important to determine the specificity of phosphoinositides toward effector proteins to understand their impact on cellular physiology. Several methods have been developed to identify and characterize phosphoinositide effectors, and liposomes-based methods are preferred because the phosphoinositides are incorporated in a membrane, the composition of which can mimic cellular membranes.

These routes have been explored for the delivery of a wide range of therapeutic agents over centuries. However, the anatomy of the skin and the physicochemical properties of molecules limit their transport via these routes. To overcome these challenges, a nano-phospholipid carrier called liposome was developed in the 1960s. Liposomal delivery of drugs was reported to be limited to the upper layers of skin. This led to the development of self-regulating and self-adaptable vesicles known as transfersomes.

      "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has advanced significantly in recent years. Nanocarriers like liposomes can improve cancer immunotherapy and even stronger immune responses by improving cell type-specific distribution. Liposomes are lipid bilayer vesicles that are biodegradable and biocompatible and are often used as smart delivery systems for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic bioactive. Whereas the idea of employing liposomes for administering drugs has been known since the 1960s, the early 2000s saw continuing technological advances and formulations for drug entrapment and manufacturing. Modern deterministic studies have tried discovering more about how genetic material is delivered through liposomes. Liposomes' interactions with cells are still a bit of mystery. Liposome-mediated transmission of genetic material experiences systemic impediments perlysosomal degradation, endosomal escape, and nuclear uptake. Controlling the physical architecture and chemical properties of liposome structures, such as lipid-to-DNA charge, ester bond composition, size, and ligand complexation structure, is critical for targeting liposomes' success as vehicles for gene delivery. This analysis focuses on advancements in ligand-targeted liposomes and theranostic (diagnostic) liposomes for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This review will explore the numerous transgene mechanisms and molecular targets implicated in cancer cell death and the associated benefits of using liposomal formulations throughout the years. This sequence of breakthroughs will interest aspiring researchers and the pharmaceutical industry involved in liposome development.",

      "abstract": "Liposomes, vesicles composed of a phospholipid bilayer, are considered a remarkably advanced drug delivery system due to their unique properties, including their biocompatibility and biodegradability, and their capability to reduce toxicity of encapsulated drugs. The in vivo fate of an encapsulated drug in the form of liposome depends on both the drug and the liposome characteristics and the patient pathophysiology. In this review, the impact of the physicochemical properties of liposomes (lipid composition, size and charge) on their pharmacokinetics (systemic absorption, distribution and clearance) was discussed. In the rest, a comprehensive overview of different mechanisms of liposomal uptake by the cells (fusion, lipid transfer, and endocytosis) was provided. The importance of lipid composition and size of liposomes, cell type, and protein corona for each uptake pathway was explained.",

      "title": "Repurposing amino-bisphosphonates by liposome formulation for a new role in cancer treatment.",
      "abstract": "Amino-bisphosphonates (N-BPs) have been commercially available for over four decades and are used for the treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, hypercalcemia of malignancy, and bone metastases derived from various cancer types. Zoledronate and alendronate, two of the most potent N-BPs, have demonstrated direct tumoricidal activity on tumor cells and immune modulatory effects on myeloid cells and T cells in vitro and in animal models of cancer. However, the rapid renal clearance and sequestration in mineral bone of these drugs in free form severely limit their systemic exposure and applications in cancer patients. Reformulation of N-BPs by encapsulation in liposomal nanoparticles addresses these pharmacokinetic barriers, and liposomal zoledronate and alendronate formulations have been found to increase the anticancer efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapies and adoptive T cell immunotherapies in murine cancer models. Herein, we review the differences in pharmacology between N-BPs versus non-N-BPs (e.g., clodronate), free versus liposomal N-BP formulations, and targeted versus non-targeted liposomal N-BPs, and the clinical and preclinical evidence supporting a role for liposomal N-BPs in the treatment of cancer. We propose that pegylated liposomal alendronate (PLA) has the most potential for clinical translation based on favorable therapeutic index, ability to passively target and accumulate in tumors, proven biocompatibility of the liposome carrier, and preclinical anticancer efficacy.",

Liposomal nanocarriers have emerged as promising candidates for targeted drug delivery to the liver. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the mechanisms and applications of liposomal nanocarriers in addressing various liver disorders. Firstly discussing the liver disorders and the conventional treatment approaches, the review delves into the liposomal structure and composition. Moreover, it tackles the different mechanisms of liposomal targeting including both passive and active strategies. After that, the review moves on to explore the therapeutic potentials of liposomal nanocarriers in treating liver cirrhosis, fibrosis, viral hepatitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Through discussing recent advancements and envisioning future perspectives, this review highlights the role of liposomal nanocarriers in enhancing the effectiveness and the safety of liver disorders and consequently improving patient outcomes and enhances life quality.",

This postoperative phase presents multiple physical, physiological, emotional, and socioeconomic challenges, not only for patients but also for their families and informal caregivers, who often describe this period as stressful and overwhelming. Health-care professionals, particularly nurses, play an integral role in a patient's discharge process; the challenges can be ameliorated through timely discharge planning and effective discharge education. The context-sensitive solutions shared in this paper propose enhancing nurses' discharge practices to provide individualized care and to facilitate the hospital-to-home transition.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND  : Discharge medicine lists provide patients, carers and primary care providers a summary of new, changed or ceased medicines when patients discharge from hospital. Hospital pharmacists play an important role in preparing these lists although this process is time consuming. AIM  : To measure the time required by hospital pharmacists to complete the various tasks involved in discharge medicine handover. METHOD  : Time-and-motion study design was used to (1) determine the time involved for pharmacists to produce discharge medicine lists, (2) explore how pharmacists utilise various software programs to prepare lists, and (3) compare the time involved in discharge medicine handover processes considering confounding factors. An independent observer shadowed 16 pharmacists between 22 February and 12 March 2021 and recorded tasks involved in 50 discharge medicine handovers. Relevant information about each discharge was also collected. RESULTS  : Pharmacists observed represented a range of practice experiences and inpatient units. Mean time to complete discharges was 26.2 min (SD 13.6), with over half of this time used to check documentation and prepare discharge medicine lists. A mean of 4.0 min was spent on manually retyping and reconciling medicine lists in different software systems. Medical inpatient unit discharges took 4.6 min longer to prepare compared to surgical ones. None of the 50 discharges involved support from pharmacy assistants; all 50 discharges had changed or ceased medicines. CONCLUSION : There is a need to streamline current discharge processes through optimisation of electronic health software systems and better delegation of technical tasks to trained pharmacy assistants.",

Whether their baby's stay is brief or long, uncomplicated or complex, a NICU stay changes how they care for their infant and how they will parent once they are discharged. While we know a NICU stay is traumatic for most parents, the consequences of a family's time spent in the NICU do not need to be negative ones. Supportive NICU teams can use the time a family is in the NICU to engage in a well-designed discharge preparation and transition planning program. These programs can have a lasting positive impact on both the infant's health and the family's wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "The discharge of older people from hospital at night is a topical and emotive issue that has recently gained media attention in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, including calls to prevent it occurring. With growing pressures on hospital capacity and ageing populations, normative aspects of hospital discharge are increasingly relevant. This paper therefore addresses the question: Should older people (say, over eighty years old) ever be discharged home from hospital during the night? Or given safety concerns, should regulation against the night-time discharge of older people be put in place? Employing a principlist lens to bioethics, this paper considers key principles or values involved, including discharge safety concerns, personal preference and consent, the risk of remaining in hospital, and broader considerations around discharge policy. These points act as a possible framework for further research and discussion of normative aspects of hospital discharge. Overall, this paper argues that while discharge safety concerns must be properly acknowledged and addressed, it can still sometimes be appropriate for an older person to leave hospital at night. The option of night-time discharge should therefore remain open to people of all ages.",

      "abstract": "With the growing utilization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative option to surgical valve replacement (SAVR) in patients considered to be suboptimal for surgery, there is a need to explore the possibility of next day discharge (NDD) and its potential outcomes. The aim of our study is to compare outcomes and complications following NDD vs the standard early discharge (ED) (less than 3 days). A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane to identify relevant trials. Summary effects were calculated using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model as odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals for all the clinical endpoints. Studies comparing same-day or next-day discharge vs discharge within the next three days were included in our analysis. 6 studies with 2,672 patients were identified. The risk of bleeding and vascular complications was significantly lower in patients with NDD compared to ED (OR 0.10, P < 0.00001 and OR 0.22, P = 0.002 respectively). The incidence of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implants was significantly lower in patients who had NDD compared to ED (OR 0.21, P = 0.0005). The incidence of 30 day mortality, stroke, AKI and readmission rates was not different between the two groups. NDD after TAVR allows for reduction in hospital stay and can mitigate hospital costs without an increased risk of complications. Our analysis shows that complication rate is comparable to ED, NDD is a reasonable option for certain patients with severe aortic stenosis who undergo TAVR. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether higher risk patients who would benefit from an extended inpatient monitoring post TAVR.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of malignant tumors in women is constantly rising. In 2018, 83 876 women were diagnosed with cancer, and 46 028 died from it. Since the 1980s, the incidence of malignant tumors in women aged 19-44 has been growing dynamically, and in middle-aged women (between 45 and 64 years old), nearly one in two deaths are due to cancer - exceeding mortality from cardiovascular disease. Upon diagnosis, the patient who may have been healthy so far faces emotions such as fear, anxiety, and sadness, caused by the awareness of having a progressive disease. Therefore, a somatic disease may trigger the development of a psychological disorder. The purpose of the present paper was to assess the emotional condition of women with cancer.",

      "abstract": "To estimate rates of hospitalizations for tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Canada, retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the incidence of patients diagnosed with TBDs during their hospital stay in Canada, and describe demographic characteristics, temporal trends and geographic distributions, from 2009 through 2021. Codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CA) were used to capture diagnoses of TBDs in the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) in Canadian hospitals. From 2009 through 2021, 1,626 patients were diagnosed with TBDs during their hospital stay. Of these, 1,457 were diagnosed with Lyme disease (LD), 162 with other TBDs, and seven were diagnosed with more than one TBD. Annual hospitalization counts for LD showed a significant increase from 50 in 2009 to 259 in 2021 (incidence rate per 100,000 population of 0.1 and 0.7, respectively). Epidemiologic patterns for hospitalized LD cases, including increases and variation in annual incidences, seasonality, demographics and geographic distribution, are consistent with those elucidated in national LD surveillance data. Amongst 162 patients diagnosed with other tick-borne diseases, discharge diagnoses were: rickettsiosis (32.7%), spotted fever due to rickettsia rickettsii (23.5%), tularemia (21.0%), babesiosis (8.6%), other tick-borne viral encephalitis (6.2%), tick-borne relapsing fever (4.9%), and Colorado tick fever (0.6%). Annual incidence increased only for rickettsiosis from 3 to 12 patients over the study period. Monitoring the data of hospitalizations using the DAD provided insights into the burden of emerging TBDs, the severity of illnesses and the population most at risk.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has gained prominence as a global pandemic. Studies have suggested that systemic alterations persist in a considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. We used proteomic and metabolomic approaches to analyze plasma samples obtained from 30 healthy subjects and 54 COVID-19 survivors 6 months after discharge from the hospital, including 30 non-severe and 24 severe patients. Through this analysis, we identified 1019 proteins and 1091 metabolites. The differentially expressed proteins and metabolites were then subjected to Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. Among the patients evaluated, 41% of COVID-19 survivors reported at least one clinical symptom and 26.5% showed lung imaging abnormalities at 6 months after discharge. Plasma proteomics and metabolomics analysis showed that COVID-19 survivors differed from healthy control subjects in terms of the extracellular matrix, immune response, and hemostasis pathways. COVID-19 survivors also exhibited abnormal lipid metabolism, disordered immune response, and changes in pulmonary fibrosis-related proteins. COVID-19 survivors show persistent proteomic and metabolomic abnormalities 6 months after discharge from the hospital. Hence, the recovery period for COVID-19 survivors may be longer.",

Of 1,902 eligible patients, 520 (27.3%) were discharged home, 945 (49.7%) were discharged to a rehabilitation clinic and 437 (23.0%) were transferred to another institution. Compared with patients discharged to a rehabilitation facility or another institution, patients discharged home were younger (80.8 ± 6.5 vs 82.9 ± 5.4 and 82.8 ± 6.4 years), less likely female (37.3% vs 59.7% and 54.2%), and at lower risk according to STS-PROM (4.5 ± 3.0% vs 5.5 ± 3.8% and 6.6 ± 4.4%). At 1 year follow-up, patients discharged home had similar rates of all-cause mortality (HR",

However, a large number of patients with COVID-19 have overcome the disease, meeting hospital discharge criteria, and are gradually returning to work and social life. Nonetheless, COVID-19 may cause further downstream issues in these patients, such as due to possible reactivation of the virus, long-term pulmonary defects, and posttraumatic stress disorder. In this study, we, therefore, queried relevant literature concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19 for reference to come to a consensus on follow-up strategies. We found that strategies, such as the implementation of polymerase chain reaction testing, imaging surveillance, and psychological assessments, starting at the time of discharge, were necessary for long-term follow-up. If close care is given to every aspect of coronavirus management, we expect that the pandemic outbreak will soon be overcome.",

      "abstract": "Background Evidence suggests intracerebral hemorrhage survivors have earlier recovery compared with ischemic stroke survivors. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services prospective payment system instituted documentation rules for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) in 2010, with the goal of optimizing patient selection. We investigated whether these requirements limited IRF and increased skilled nursing facility (SNF) use compared with home discharge. Methods and Results Intracerebral hemorrhage discharges to IRF, SNF, or home were estimated using GWTG (Get With The Guidelines) Stroke registry data between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015 (n=265 444). Binary hierarchical models determined associations between the 2010 Rule and discharge setting; subgroup analyses evaluated age, geographic region, and hospital type. From January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009, 45.5% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage had home discharge, 22.2% went to SNF, and 32.3% went to IRF. After January 1, 2010, there was a 1.06% absolute increase in home discharge, a 0.46% increase in SNF, and a 1.52% decline in IRF. The adjusted odds of IRF versus home discharge decreased 3% after 2010 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-1.00). Lower odds of IRF versus home discharge were observed in people aged <65 years (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96), Western states (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95), and nonteaching hospitals (aOR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.95). Adjusted odds of SNF versus home discharge increased 14% after 2010 (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.11-1.18); there were significant associations in all age groups, the Northeast, the South, the Midwest, and teaching hospitals. Conclusions The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2010 IRF prospective payment system Rule resulted in fewer discharges to IRF and more discharges to SNF in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Health policy changes potentially affect access to intensive postacute rehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Total joint arthroplasties are one of the most common procedures performed in the United States. As changes have occurred in the surgical techniques of these procedures, postoperative recovery time has decreased and patients have been able to safely transition to home rather than a post-acute care facility. The demand for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is expected to grow 44% as the prevalence of lower extremity osteoarthritis continues to rise (Sher et al., 2017) because of an aging baby boomer population. In the next 20 years, it is expected that the demand for total hip arthroplasty will grow by 174% and demand for total knee arthroplasty will grow by as much as 670% (Napier et al., 2013). An area with high variability in the postoperative period is in postdischarge rehabilitation. Post-acute inpatient care can account for up to 36% of the bundled costs of a TJA. There is a lack of evidence that patients recover better or have decreased complications by transitioning to an inpatient rehabilitation setting compared with transitioning to home. The aims of this literature search were to (a) identify the safest discharge disposition for patients following TJA; (b) determine the rate of complications and readmissions among those discharged to skilled nursing facility, inpatient rehabilitation unit, and home; and (c) explore how specified care pathways affect patient expectations and outcomes. The Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, ProQuest, and Cochrane were searched using the following key terms: discharge disposition, total joint arthroplasty, joint replacement, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty, care pathway, discharge outcomes and readmissions, discharge protocols, and discharge algorithms. Five key themes emerged. Patients with significant comorbidities may require longer length of stay in the hospital or potentially discharge to a facility, discharge to facility associated with high rate of complications, setting patient expectations increases likelihood of discharge home, discharge to inpatient facilities does not improve outcomes, and discharge to any post-acute care facility is more expensive than discharge to home. This review identified themes in postoperative care of TJA patients that can be utilized to create a discharge disposition algorithm using best practices to stratify patients into the appropriate discharge disposition while setting appropriate expectations for patients undergoing these procedures to ensure high levels of patient satisfaction following these procedures.",

      "abstract": "Cancer remains a highly lethal disease in the world. Currently, either conventional cancer therapies or modern immunotherapies are non-tumor-targeted therapeutic approaches that cannot accurately distinguish malignant cells from healthy ones, giving rise to multiple undesired side effects. Recent advances in nanotechnology, accompanied by our growing understanding of cancer biology and nano-bio interactions, have led to the development of a series of nanocarriers, which aim to improve the therapeutic efficacy while reducing off-target toxicity of the encapsulated anticancer agents through tumor tissue-, cell-, or organelle-specific targeting. However, the vast majority of nanocarriers do not possess hierarchical targeting capability, and their therapeutic indices are often compromised by either poor tumor accumulation, inefficient cellular internalization, or inaccurate subcellular localization. This Review outlines current and prospective strategies in the design of tumor tissue-, cell-, and organelle-targeted cancer nanomedicines, and highlights the latest progress in hierarchical targeting technologies that can dynamically integrate these three different stages of static tumor targeting to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Finally, we briefly discuss the current challenges and future opportunities for the clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines.",

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology has provided great opportunities for managing neoplastic conditions at various levels, from preventive and diagnostic to therapeutic fields. However, when it comes to clinical application, nanoparticles (NPs) have some limitations in terms of biological stability, poor targeting, and rapid clearance from the body. Therefore, biomimetic approaches, utilizing immune cell membranes, are proposed to solve these issues. For example, macrophage or neutrophil cell membrane coated NPs are developed with the ability to interact with tumor tissue to suppress cancer progression and metastasis. The functionality of these particles largely depends on the surface proteins of the immune cells and their preserved function during membrane extraction and coating process on the NPs. Proteins on the outer surface of immune cells can render a wide range of activities to the NPs, including prolonged blood circulation, remarkable competency in recognizing antigens for enhanced targeting, better cellular interactions, gradual drug release, and reduced toxicity in vivo. In this review, nano-based systems coated with immune cells-derived membranous layers, their detailed production process, and the applicability of these biomimetic systems in cancer treatment are discussed. In addition, future perspectives and challenges for their clinical translation are also presented.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have leveraged magnetic nanomaterials (MNMs) to explore neural circuits and treat neurological diseases via an approach known as MNMs-mediated neuromodulation. Here, the magneto-responsive effects of MNMs to an external magnetic field are manipulated to activate or inhibit neuronal cell activity. In this way, MNMs can serve as a nano-mediator, by converting electromagnetic energy into heat, mechanical force/torque, and an electrical field at nanoscale. These physicochemical effects can stimulate ion channels and activate precise signaling pathways involved in neuromodulation. In this review, we outline the various ion channels and MNMs that have been applied to MNMs-mediated neuromodulation. We highlight the recent advances made in this technique and its potential applications, and then discuss the current challenges and future directions of MNMs-mediated neuromodulation. Our aim is to reveal the potential of MNMs to treat neurological diseases in the clinical setting.

      "abstract": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), as one of the most used immunoassays, have been conducted ubiquitously in hospitals, research laboratories, etc. However, the conventional ELISA procedure is usually laborious, occupies bulky instruments, consumes lengthy operation time, and relies considerably on the skills of technicians, and such limitations call for innovations to develop a fully automated ELISA platform. In this paper, we have presented a system incorporating a robotic-microfluidic interface (RoMI) and a modular hybrid microfluidic chip that embeds a highly sensitive nanofibrous membrane, referred to as the Robotic ELISA, to achieve human-free sample-to-answer ELISA tests in a fully programmable and automated manner. It carries out multiple bioanalytical procedures to replace the manual steps involved in classic ELISA operations, including the pneumatically driven high-precision pipetting, efficient mixing and enrichment enabled by back-and-forth flows, washing, and integrated machine vision for colorimetric readout. The Robotic ELISA platform has achieved a low limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL in the detection of a low sample volume (15 μL) of chloramphenicol within 20 min without human intervention, which is significantly faster than that of the conventional ELISA procedure. Benefiting from its modular design and automated operations, the Robotic ELISA platform has great potential to be deployed for a broad range of detections in various resource-limited settings or high-risk environments, where human involvement needs to be minimized while the testing timeliness, consistency, and sensitivity are all desired.",

Nature has inspired the design ideas, preparation methods, and applications of versatile micro/nanomotors. This review summarizes diverse nature-inspired micro/nanomotors, which can be divided into five groups: (i) natural morphology-inspired micro/nanomotors, whose shapes are designed to imitate the morphologies of plants, animals, and objects in nature. (ii) Natural structure-inspired micro/nanomotors, which use structures from plants, red blood cells, and platelet cells as components of micro/nanomotors, or directly use sperm cells and microorganisms as the engines of micro/nanomotors. (iii) Natural behavior-inspired micro/nanomotors, which are proposed to mimic natural behaviors such as motion behavior, swarm behavior, and communication behavior between individuals. (iv) Micro/nanomotors inspired by both natural morphology and behavior. Nature makes it possible for synthetic micro/nanomotors to possess interesting morphologies, novel preparation methods, new propulsion modes, innovative functions, and broad applications. The nature-inspired micro/nanomotors could provide a promising platform for various practical fields.",

      "abstract": "A post-nanotechnology concept has been assigned to an emerging concept, nanoarchitectonics. Nanoarchitectonics aims to establish a discipline in which functional materials are fabricated from nano-scale components such as atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials using various techniques. Nanoarchitectonics opens ways to form a more unified paradigm by integrating nanotechnology with organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, material chemistry, microfabrication technology, and biotechnology. On the other hand, biological systems consist of rational organization of constituent molecules. Their structures have highly asymmetric and hierarchical features that allow for chained functional coordination, signal amplification, and vector-like energy and signal flow. The process of nanoarchitectonics is based on the premise of combining several different processes, which makes it easier to obtain a hierarchical structure. Therefore, nanoarchitectonics is a more suitable methodology for creating highly functional systems based on structural asymmetry and hierarchy like biosystems. The creation of functional materials by nanoarchitectonics is somewhat similar to the creation of functional systems in biological systems. It can be said that the goal of nanoarchitectonics is to create highly functional systems similar to those found in biological systems. This review article summarizes the synthesis of biomimetic and biological molecules and their functional structure formation from various viewpoints, from the molecular level to the cellular level. Several recent examples are arranged and categorized to illustrate such a trend with sections of (i) synthetic nanoarchitectonics for bio-related units, (ii) self-assembly nanoarchitectonics with bio-related units, (iii) nanoarchitectonics with nucleic acids, (iv) nanoarchitectonics with peptides, (v) nanoarchitectonics with proteins, and (vi) bio-related nanoarchitectonics in conjugation with materials.",

      "abstract": "Membranes are ubiquitous tools for modern water treatment technology that critically eliminate hazardous materials such as organic, inorganic, heavy metals, and biomedical pollutants. Nowadays, nano-membranes are of particular interest for myriad applications such as water treatment, desalination, ion exchange, ion concentration control, and several kinds of biomedical applications. However, this state-of-the-art technology suffers from some drawbacks, e.g., toxicity and fouling of contaminants, which makes the synthesis of green and sustainable membranes indeed safety-threatening. Typically, sustainability, non-toxicity, performance optimization, and commercialization are concerns centered on manufacturing green synthesized membranes. Thus, critical issues related to toxicity, biosafety, and mechanistic aspects of green-synthesized nano-membranes have to be systematically and comprehensively reviewed and discussed. Herein we evaluate various aspects of green nano-membranes in terms of their synthesis, characterization, recycling, and commercialization aspects. Nanomaterials intended for nano-membrane development are classified in view of their chemistry/synthesis, advantages, and limitations. Indeed, attaining prominent adsorption capacity and selectivity in green-synthesized nano-membranes requires multi-objective optimization of a number of materials and manufacturing parameters. In addition, the efficacy and removal performance of green nano-membranes are analyzed theoretically and experimentally to provide researchers and manufacturers with a comprehensive image of green nano-membrane efficiency under real environmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "Photo-assisted therapy has been an advancing branch in the fields of modern theranostics and nanomedicine, holding observable superiorities such as noninvasiveness, deep tissue penetration, and spatial precision. Aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have emerged as powerful fluorescent materials and organic optical agents capable of performing therapeutic effects under light activation. In this review, we underscore the elaborate design and fabrication of AIEgen-based supramolecular materials for applications in the scope of photo-assisted therapy, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and photo-induced reactions. With the aid of supramolecular self-assembly, AIE materials are endowed with higher biocompatibility, better specificity, external stimuli responsiveness, and integrated functionalities. AIEgen-based self-assembled materials categorized by different supramolecular driving forces are summarized with their respective features in both structures and therapeutic effects fully described. With these highly adjustable physicochemical properties of supramolecular assemblies, the functions of such AIE materials can be considerably expanded and optimized, also opening up possibilities for controllable multimodal theranostics. In the conclusion part, perspectives and remaining challenges in this research area are discussed.",

Utilizing plasmonic-fluors as ultrabright fluorescent nanolabels, we reveal that negative surface charge of nanoparticles renders selective nano-neuro interaction with a strong correlation between the maturation stage of the individual neurons in the neural network and the density of the nanoparticles bound on the neurons.

In contrast, the spinning technologies developed by human beings are usually clumsy and require sophisticated skills. Here, inspired by adhesion-based silkworm spinning, we report a microadhesion guided (MAG) spinning technology for instant and on-demand fabrication of micro/nanofibers. Enabled by the adhesion between the spinning fluids and the microneedles, the MAG spinning can generate micro/nanofibers with programmable morphology. By further mimicking the head movement of the silkworm spinning, the MAG technology is extended with three different modes: straight, vibratory, and twisted spinning, which generate oriented fibers, hierarchical cross-linked fibers, and all-in-one fibers, respectively. Due to the prevalence of microadhesion and its unprecedented flexibility in operation, equipment-free MAG spinning is finally realized for instant fiber fabrication by only polymeric foams. Finally, the MAG spinning is demonstrated as a promising instant technology for emergent applications, such as wound dressing.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are natural extracellular nanovesicles (30-150 nm in diameter) with the ability to interact with and be taken up by specific cells. They are being explored as delivery systems and imaging agents for biomedical purposes owing to their biocompatibility, biostability in extracellular biofluids, and organotropic properties. However, their usefulness, efficacy, and clinical application are limited by certain critical parameters, including the need for more robust and reproducible manufacturing processes, characterization, quality control assessment, and clinical studies. Recently, exosome-like systems have emerged as alternatives for overcoming the limitations of natural exosomes. These systems are based on surface engineering approaches and nanoscale platforms that offer a deeper understanding and allow for more exhaustive standardization compared with natural exosomes. By combining the latest knowledge related to exosome research with the most promising developments in nanotechnology, exosome-like systems can be developed as a competitive approach for innovative targeted anti-cancer therapies. This review aims to provide a critical overview of the latest advances in designing and testing innovative exosome-like systems and the most promising modalities that can be translated into the clinic. Future perspectives and challenges in this field are discussed.",

There have been many reports concerning the role of these nano-building blocks in the regeneration of both soft and hard tissues, but the subject has not been extensively reviewed. Here, we review, classify, and discuss various synthesis strategies for novel MNSs used in medicine. Advanced applications of magnetic nanocomposites (MG-NCs), specifically magnetic nanostructures, are further systematically reviewed. In addition, the scientific and technical aspects of MG-NC used in medicine are discussed considering the requirements for the field.

      "abstract": "Brain organoids are self-assembled three-dimensional aggregates with brain-like cell types and structures and have emerged as new model systems that can be used to investigate human neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. However, brain organoids are not as mature and functional as real human brains due to limitations of the culture system with insufficient developmental patterning signals and a lack of components that are important for brain development and function, such as the non-neural population and vasculature. In addition, establishing the desired brain-like environment and monitoring the complex neural networks and physiological functions of the brain organoids remain challenging. The current protocols to generate brain organoids also have problems with heterogeneity and batch variation due to spontaneous self-organization of brain organoids into complex architectures of the brain. To address these limitations of current brain organoid technologies, various engineering platforms, such as extracellular matrices, fluidic devices, three-dimensional bioprinting, bioreactors, polymeric scaffolds, microelectrodes, and biochemical sensors, have been employed to improve neuronal development and maturation, reduce structural heterogeneity, and facilitate functional analysis and monitoring. In this review, we provide an overview of the latest engineering techniques that overcome these limitations in the production and application of brain organoids.",

This Perspective reviews this evolution in nanomotor research and discusses the key challenges ahead, including the need for developing advanced characterization techniques, precise motion control, materials innovation, theory and modelling, and translationally feasible in vivo biomedical applications. These challenges highlight the current limitations of synthetic nanomotors and point to exciting future opportunities to revolutionize theranostics and create 'living' hybrid systems. We introduce the concept of 'systems materials' to encompass interacting functional materials across length scales from molecular to macro. Thus, this Perspective aims to inspire future generations of researchers to advance both fundamental understanding and practical breakthroughs, thereby engineering a paradigm shift in nanomotor research.",

Generations of scientists have examined the architecture of the human cortex, but efforts to capture the gene networks which drive arealization have been hampered by the lack of tractable models of human neurodevelopment. Advancements in \"omics\" technologies, imaging, and computational power have enabled exciting breakthroughs into the molecular and structural characteristics of cortical areas, including transcriptomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, and proteomic profiles of mammalian models.

Due to their unique physical, mechanical and optical properties, van der Waals (vdW) materials possess extraordinary potential for application in future optoelectronics devices. Nano-engineering and nano-manufacturing in the atomically thin regime has further opened multifarious avenues to explore novel physical properties. Among them, moiré heterostructures, strain engineering and substrate manipulation have created numerous exotic and topological phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, orbital magnetism, flexible nanoelectronics and highly efficient photovoltaics. This review comprehensively summarizes the three most influential techniques of nano-engineering in 2D materials. The latest development in the marvels of moiré structures in vdW materials is discussed; in addition, topological structures in layered materials and substrate engineering on the nanoscale are thoroughly scrutinized to highlight their significance in micro- and nano-devices. Finally, we conclude with remarks on challenges and possible future directions in the rapidly expanding field of nanotechnology and nanomaterial.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the developments in the area of microfluidics, the cavitation-on-a-chip concept enabled researchers to control and closely monitor the cavitation phenomenon in micro-scale. In contrast to conventional scale, where cavitation bubbles are hard to be steered and manipulated, lab-on-a-chip devices provide suitable platforms to conduct smart experiments and design reliable devices to carefully harness the collapse energy of cavitation bubbles in different bio-related and industrial applications. However, bubble behavior deviates to some extent when confined to micro-scale geometries in comparison to macro-scale. Therefore, fundamentals of micro-scale cavitation deserve in-depth investigations. In this review, first we discussed the physics and fundamentals of cavitation induced by tension-based as well as energy deposition-based methods within microfluidic devices and discussed the similarities and differences in micro and macro-scale cavitation. We then covered and discussed recent developments in bio-related applications of micro-scale cavitation chips. Lastly, current challenges and future research directions towards the implementation of micro-scale cavitation phenomenon to emerging applications are presented.",

This review takes account of the concept of nanomotors and micromotors and their most advancements in use for oil spill treatment. The fundamental facets of artificial micro- and nano-machines/nanobots/nanomotors (MNMs) are first documented, followed by the most recent influencing developments in chemical engineering approaches toward their specific utilizations. The surface chemistry of these MNMs, their behaviors in different water matrices and their roles in the removal of oil are examined, revealing great rooms for improvement. The strategies for surface and structural modification of these tiny machines toward enhancing their reactivity in the removal of oil and coupled tasking are discussed in details, highlighting the significance of fit-for-duty design and tailored fabrication. The engineering limitations and practical implementation barriers of this emerging technology and how it can be overcome are also considered. Finally, some engineering boundaries and perspectives of this fast-evolving field are proposed at the end.",

      "abstract": "The impetuous development of nanotechnology over the past two decades has enabled the production of a plethora of nanomaterials with outstanding optical, magnetic, electrical, catalytic and mechanical properties. The versatility of these materials attracted attention from the very beginning in the most disparate sectors of science and technology. The application of nanomaterials in the biological and biomedical fields soon benefited from the interaction with liposomes, which increased their biocompatibility and biostability. Liposomes indeed are versatile self-assembling supramolecular (nano)structures constituted of an aqueous core enclosed by a lipid bilayer, able to host hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargo, and with superior biocompatibility and great similarity with the biological membranes. The result is the construction of hybrid nanoscale architectures, in which nanoparticles (NPs) are allocated either in the aqueous core, in the palisade of the lipid bilayer or on the outer surface of the vesicles. In the first part of this review, the principal methods for the preparation of NP-loaded liposomes are carefully illustrated in a tutorial manner. In the second part, an overview of the great potentialities deriving from the conjugation of liposomes with NPs is presented. In each paragraph, the main characteristics of the most notable classes of NPs, the related issues, and the advantages arising from their association with liposomes are shown. Here, the most significant research works in literature for each kind of system are presented.",

      "title": "Nano-biocatalysts for food applications; immobilized enzymes within different nanostructures.",
      "abstract": "The rapid progress in modern technologies and paying more attention to food safety has prompted new green technologies superior than chemical methods in the food industry. In this regard, enzymes can decrease the usage of chemical reactions but they are sensitive to environmental effects (pH and temperature). In addition, enzymes are scarcely possible to be reused. Consequently, their application as natural catalysts is restricted. Using nanotechnology and the possibility of enzyme immobilization on nanomaterials has led to nanobiocatalysts, resulting from the integration of nanotechnology and biotechnology. Nanocarriers have individual features like nanoscale size, excellent surface/volume ratio, and diversity in construction to improve the activity, efficiency, stability, and storage stability of enzymes. Nanobiocatolysts have a wide range of applications in purification, extraction, clarification, production, and packaging of various products in the food industry. Furthermore, the application of nanobiocatalysts to identify specific components of food contaminants such as microorganisms or their metabolites, heavy metals, antibiotics, and residual pesticides has been successful due to the high accuracy of detection. This review investigates the integration of nanotechnology and food enzymes, the nanomaterials used to create nanobiocatalysts and their application, along with the possible risks and legal aspects of nanomaterials in food bioprocesses.",

      "abstract": "Current management of anesthesia-associated complications falls short in terms of both efficacy and safety. Nanomaterials with versatile properties and unique nano-bio interactions hold substantial promise as therapeutics for addressing these complications. This review conducts a thorough examination of the existing nanotherapeutics and highlights the strategies for developing prospective nanomedicines to mitigate anesthetics-related toxicity. Initially, general, regional, and local anesthesia along with the commonly used anesthetics and related prevalent side effects are introduced. Furthermore, employing nanotechnology to prevent and alleviate the complications of anesthetics is systematically demonstrated from three aspects, that is, developing 1) safe nano-formulization for anesthetics; 2) nano-antidotes to sequester overdosed anesthetics and alter their pharmacokinetics; 3) nanomedicines with pharmacodynamic activities to treat anesthetics toxicity. Finally, the prospects and challenges facing the clinical translation of nanotherapeutics for anesthesia-related complications are discussed. This work provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing effective nanotherapeutics to prevent and mitigate anesthesia-associated toxicity, which can potentially revolutionize the management of anesthesia complications.",

      "abstract": "With a rapid advancement of nanotechnology and the close integration of disciplines, research on nanozymes (nanomaterials with enzyme-like activities), is becoming an expeditiously developing field. In recent years, platinum group element (PGE)-based (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, Ir, and Os) nanozymes developed successively, have not only promoted the research of nanozymes but also expanded the biomedical applications of nanomaterials. Generally speaking, PGE-based nanozymes process high catalytic efficiency, specific surface area, stability, and other physical/chemical properties, which benefit for their applications in biosensing, biological medicine, biomedical imaging, and environmental protection. This paper will introduce the research progress of PGE-based nanozymes including their synthesis, characterization, enzyme-like activities, stability, biocompatibility, toxicity, and applications for biological detection and clinical relevance. Our emphasis is put on unfolding the roles of PGE-based nanozymes in biomedical applications and how they overcome the limitations.

The connections between microbiota and human diseases offer numerous opportunities in medicine, most of which have limited or no therapeutic solutions available. In light of this paradigm-setting trend in science, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and timely summary of the mechanistic pathways governing the gut microbiota and their implications for nanomedicines targeting cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we discuss in parallel the beneficial and pathogenic relationship of the gut microbiota along the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes, elaborate on the impact of dysbiosis and the gastrointestinal corona on the efficacy of nanomedicines, and highlight a molecular mimicry that manipulates the universal cross-β backbone of bacterial amyloid to accelerate neurological disorders. This review further offers a forward-looking section on the rational design of cancer and dementia nanomedicines exploiting the gut-brain and gut-cancer axes.",

      "abstract": "The 20th century has seen tremendous innovation of dielectrophoresis (DEP) technologies, with applications being developed in areas ranging from industrial processing to micro- and nanoscale biotechnology. From 2010 to present day, there have been 981 publications about DEP. Of over 2600 DEP patents held by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, 106 were filed in 2019 alone. This review focuses on DEP-based technologies and application developments between 2010 and 2020, with an aim to highlight the progress and to identify potential areas for future research. A major trend over the last 10 years has been the use of DEP techniques for biological and clinical applications. It has been used in various forms on a diverse array of biologically derived molecules and particles to manipulate and study them including proteins, exosomes, bacteria, yeast, stem cells, cancer cells, and blood cells. DEP has also been used to manipulate nano- and micron-sized particles in order to fabricate different structures. The next 10 years are likely to see the increase in DEP-related patent applications begin to result in a greater level of technology commercialization. Also during this time, innovations in DEP technology will likely be leveraged to continue the existing trend to further biological and medical-focused applications as well as applications in microfabrication. As a tool leveraged by engineering and imaginative scientific design, DEP offers unique capabilities to manipulate small particles in precise ways that can help solve problems and enable scientific inquiry that cannot be addressed using conventional methods.",

      "abstract": "Cancer diagnosis and treatment are the most critical challenges in modern medicine. Conventional cancer treatments no longer meet the needs of the health field due to the high rate of mutations and epigenetic factors that have caused drug resistance in tumor cells. Hence, the search for unique methods and factors is quickly expanding. The development of nanotechnology in medicine and the search for a system to integrate treatment and diagnosis to achieve an effective approach to overcome the known limitations of conventional treatment methods have led to the emergence of theranostic nanoparticles and nanosystems based on these nanoparticles. An influential group of these nanoparticles is carbon-based theranostic nanoparticles. These nanoparticles have received significant attention due to their unique properties, such as electrical conductivity, high strength, excellent surface chemistry, and wide range of structural diversity (graphene, nanodiamond, carbon quantum dots, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanohorns). These nanoparticles were widely used in various fields, such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, imaging, and biosensors. In this review, we discuss in detail the recent features and advances in carbon-based theranostic nanoparticles and the advanced and diverse strategies used to treat diseases with these nanoparticles.",

      "abstract": "There are numerous investigated factors that limit brain cancer treatment efficacy such as ability of prescribed therapy to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), tumor specific delivery of a therapeutics, transport within brain interstitium, and resistance of tumor cells against therapies. Recent breakthroughs in the field of nano-biotechnology associated with developing multifunctional nano-theranostic emerged as an effective way to manage brain cancer in terms of higher efficacy and least possible adverse effects. Keeping challenges and state-of-art accomplishments into consideration, this review proposes a comprehensive, careful, and critical discussion focused on efficient nano-enabled platforms including nanocarriers for drug delivery across the BBB and nano-assisted therapies (e.g., nano-immunotherapy, nano-stem cell therapy, and nano-gene therapy) investigated for brain cancer treatment. Besides therapeutic efficacy point-of-view, efforts are being made to explore ways projected to tune such developed nano-therapeutic for treating patients in personalized manner via controlling size, drug loading, delivery, and retention. Personalized brain tumor management based on advanced nano-therapies can potentially lead to excellent therapeutic benefits based on unique genetic signatures in patients and their individual disease profile. Moreover, applicability of nano-systems as stimulants to manage the brain cancer growth factors has also been discussed in photodynamic therapy and radiotherapy. Overall, this review offers a comprehensive information on emerging opportunities in nanotechnology for advancing the brain cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Bladder cancer (BCa) is one of the most expensive and common malignancies in the urinary system due to its high progression and recurrence rate. Although there are various methods, including cystoscopy, biopsy, and cytology, that have become the standard diagnosis methods for BCa, their intrinsic invasive and inaccurate properties need to be overcome. The novel urine cancer biomarkers are assisted by nanomaterials-based biosensors, such as field-effect transistors (FETs) with high sensitivity and specificity, which may provide solutions to these problems. In addition, nanomaterials can be applied for the advancement of next-generation optical imaging techniques and the contrast agents of conventional techniques; for example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of BCa. Regarding BCa therapy, nanocarriers, including mucoadhesive nanoparticles and other polymeric nanoparticles, successfully overcome the disadvantages of conventional intravesical instillation and improve the efficacy and safety of intravesical chemotherapy for BCa. Aside from chemotherapy, nanomedicine-based novel therapies, including photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), chemodynamic therapy (CDT), sonodynamic therapy (SDT), and combination therapy, have afforded us new ways to provide BC therapy and hope, which can be translated into the clinic. In addition, nanomotors and the nanomaterials-based solid tumor disassociation strategy provide new ideas for future research. Here, the advances in BCa diagnosis and therapy mentioned above are reviewed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology has emerged as a key empowering technology for agriculture production due to its higher efficiency and accurate target delivery. However, the sustainable and effective application of nanotechnology requires nanomaterials (NMs) to have higher stability and less aggregation/coagulation at the reaction sites. This can ideally be achieved by modifying NMs with some surfactants or capping agents to ensure higher efficiency. These modified nanomaterials (MNMs) stabilize the interface where NMs interact with their medium of preparation and showed a significant improvement in mobility, reactivity, and controlled release of active ingredients for nano-enabled agriculture. Several environmental factors (e.g., pH, organic matter and the oxidation-reduction potential) could alter the interaction of MNMs with agricultural plants. Firstly, this novel review article introduces production technologies and a few frequently used modification agents in synthesizing MNMs. Next, we critically elaborate the leveraging progress in the modified nano-enabled agronomy and unveil their phytoremediation potential. Lastly, we propose a framework to overcome current challenges and develop a strategy for safe, effective and acceptable applications of MNMs in nano-enabled agriculture. However, the long-term effectiveness and reactivity of MNMs should be investigated to assess their technology effectiveness and optimize the process design to draw definite conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Robots with submillimeter dimensions are of interest for applications that range from tools for minimally invasive surgical procedures in clinical medicine to vehicles for manipulating cells/tissues in biology research. The limited classes of structures and materials that can be used in such robots, however, create challenges in achieving desired performance parameters and modes of operation. Here, we introduce approaches in manufacturing and actuation that address these constraints to enable untethered, terrestrial robots with complex, three-dimensional (3D) geometries and heterogeneous material construction. The manufacturing procedure exploits controlled mechanical buckling to create 3D multimaterial structures in layouts that range from arrays of filaments and origami constructs to biomimetic configurations and others. A balance of forces associated with a one-way shape memory alloy and the elastic resilience of an encapsulating shell provides the basis for reversible deformations of these structures. Modes of locomotion and manipulation span from bending, twisting, and expansion upon global heating to linear/curvilinear crawling, walking, turning, and jumping upon laser-induced local thermal actuation. Photonic structures such as retroreflectors and colorimetric sensing materials support simple forms of wireless monitoring and localization. These collective advances in materials, manufacturing, actuation, and sensing add to a growing body of capabilities in this emerging field of technology.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, especially antibiotic-resistant bacteria, are one of the biggest threats to global health. To date, bacterial contamination is detected using conventional culturing techniques, which are highly dependent on expert users, limited by the processing time and on-site availability. Hence, real-time and continuous monitoring of pathogen levels is required to obtain valuable information that could assist health agencies in guiding prevention and containment of pathogen-related outbreaks. Nanotechnology-based smart sensors are opening new avenues for early and rapid detection of such pathogens at the patient's point-of-care. Nanomaterials can play an essential role in bacterial sensing owing to their unique optical, magnetic, and electrical properties. Carbon nanoparticles, metallic nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, and various types of nanocomposites are examples of smart nanomaterials that have drawn intense attention in the field of microbial detection. These approaches, together with the advent of modern technologies and coupled with machine learning and wireless communication, represent the future trend in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. This review provides an overview of the recent advancements in the successful harnessing of different nanoparticles for bacterial detection. In the beginning, we have introduced the fundamental concepts and mechanisms behind the design and strategies of the nanoparticles-based diagnostic platform. Representative research efforts are highlighted for in vitro and in vivo detection of bacteria. A comprehensive discussion is then presented to cover the most commonly adopted techniques for bacterial identification, including some seminal studies to detect bacteria at the single-cell level. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and a prospective outlook on the field, together with the recommended solutions.",

      "abstract": "As antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes continue to emerge, the identification of effective alternatives to traditional antibiotics has become a pressing issue. Antimicrobial peptides are favored for their safety, low residue, and low resistance properties, and their unique antimicrobial mechanisms show significant potential in combating antibiotic resistance. However, the high production cost and weak activity of antimicrobial peptides limit their application. Moreover, traditional laboratory methods for identifying and designing new antimicrobial peptides are time-consuming and labor-intensive, hindering their development. Currently, novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) are being employed to develop and design new antimicrobial peptide resources, offering new opportunities for the advancement of antimicrobial peptides. This article summarizes the basic characteristics and antimicrobial mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides, as well as their advantages and limitations, and explores the application of AI in antimicrobial peptides prediction amd design. This highlights the crucial role of AI in enhancing the efficiency of antimicrobial peptide research and provides a reference for antimicrobial drug development.",

      "abstract": "Kombucha is a low alcoholic beverage with high content of bioactive compounds derived from plant material (tea, juices, herb extracts) and metabolic activity of microorganisms (acetic acid bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeasts). Currently, it attracts an increasing number of consumers due to its health-promoting properties. This review focuses on aspects significantly affecting the bioactive compound content and biological activities of Kombucha tea. The literature review shows that the drink is characterized by a high content of bioactive compounds, strong antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties. Factors that substantially affect these activities are the tea type and its brewing parameters, the composition of the SCOBY, as well as the fermentation parameters. On the other hand, Kombucha fermentation is characterized by many unknowns, which result, inter alia, from different methods of tea extraction, diverse, often undefined compositions of microorganisms used in the fermentation, as well as the lack of clearly defined effects of microorganisms on bioactive compounds contained in tea, and therefore the health-promoting properties of the final product. The article indicates the shortcomings in the current research in the field of Kombucha, as well as future perspectives on improving the health-promoting activities of this fermented drink.",

Next, the focus was on one of the groups of bioactive components that are used in these packaging, namely antimicrobial agents. Among the antimicrobial agents, we selected those that have already been used in packaging and that promise to be used elsewhere, e.g., in the production of antimicrobial biomaterials. Main groups of antimicrobial agents (i.e., metals and metal oxides, organic acids, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriocins, antimicrobial agents of plant origin, enzymes, lactoferrin, chitosan, allyl isothiocyanate, the reuterin system and bacteriophages) that are incorporated or combined with various types of packaging materials to extend the shelf life of food are described. The further development of perspectives and setting of new research directions were also presented.",

      "abstract": "Fluorinated compounds are widely used in the fields of molecular imaging, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Fluorinated natural products in nature are rare, and the introduction of fluorine atoms into organic compound molecules can give these compounds new functions and make them have better performance. Therefore, the synthesis of fluorides has attracted more and more attention from biologists and chemists. Even so, achieving selective fluorination is still a huge challenge under mild conditions. In this review, the research progress of enzymatic synthesis of fluorinated compounds is summarized since 2015, including cytochrome P450 enzymes, aldolases, fluoroacetyl coenzyme A thioesterases, lipases, transaminases, reductive aminases, purine nucleoside phosphorylases, polyketide synthases, fluoroacetate dehalogenases, tyrosine phenol-lyases, glycosidases, fluorinases, and multienzyme system. Of all enzyme-catalyzed synthesis methods, the direct formation of the C-F bond by fluorinase is the most effective and promising method. The structure and catalytic mechanism of fluorinase are introduced to understand fluorobiochemistry. Furthermore, the distribution, applications, and future development trends of fluorinated compounds are also outlined. Hopefully, this review will help researchers to understand the significance of enzymatic methods for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds and find or create excellent fluoride synthase in future research.Key points• Fluorinated compounds are distributed in plants and microorganisms, and are used in imaging, medicine, materials science.• Enzyme catalysis is essential for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds.• The loop structure of fluorinase is the key to forming the C-F bond.",

      "abstract": "Bacteriocins are a diverse group of ribosomally synthesised antimicrobial peptides/proteins that play an important role in self-defence. They are widely used as bio-preservatives and effective substitutes for disease eradication. They can be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to antibiotics to minimize the risk of resistance development. There are remarkably few reports indicating resistance to bacteriocins. Although there are many research reports that emphasise heterologous expression of bacteriocin, there are no convincing reports on the significant role that intrinsic and extrinsic factors play in overexpression. A coordinated and cooperative expression system works in concert with multiple genetic elements encoding native proteins, immunoproteins, exporters, transporters and enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of bacteriocins. The simplest way could be to utilise the existing E. coli expression system, which is conventional, widely used for heterologous expression and has been further extended for bacteriocin expression. In this article, we will review the intrinsic and extrinsic factors, advantages, disadvantages and major problems associated with bacteriocin overexpression in E. coli. Finally, we recommend the most effective strategies as well as numerous bacteriocin expression systems from E. coli, Lactococcus, Kluveromyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia pastoris for their suitability for successful overexpression.",

      "abstract": "It is highly possible to obtain high-quality microbial products in appreciable amounts, as aerospace technology is advancing continuously. Genome-wide genetic variations in microorganisms can be triggered by space microgravity and radiation. Mutation rate is high, mutant range is wide, and final mutant character is stable. Therefore, space microorganism breeding is growing to be a new and promising area in microbial science and has greatly propelled the development of fermentation technology. Numerous studies have discovered the following improvements of fermentation potential in microorganisms after exposure to space: (1) reduction in fermentation cycle and increase in growth rate; (2) improvement of mixed fermentation species; (3) increase in bacterial conjugation efficiency and motility; (4) improvement of the bioactivity of various key enzymes and product quality; (5) enhancement of multiple adverse stress resistance; (6) improvement of fermentation metabolites, flavor, appearance, and stability. Aerospace fermentation technology predominantly contributes to bioprocessing in a microgravity environment. Unlike terrestrial fermentation, aerospace fermentation keeps cells suspended in the fluid medium without significant shear forces. Space radiation and microgravity have physical, chemical, and biological effects on mutant microorganisms by causing alternation in fluid dynamics and genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome levels.",

However, designing TFBs with superior performance for applications in synthetic biology remains challenging. Specifically, natural TFBs often do not meet real-time detection requirements owing to their slow response times and inappropriate dynamic ranges, detection ranges, sensitivity, and selectivity. Furthermore, designing and optimizing complex dynamic regulation networks is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This Review highlights TFB-based applications and recent engineering strategies ranging from traditional trial-and-error approaches to novel computer-model-based rational design approaches.

      "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have beneficial roles in a variety of human pathologies and disorders. Owing to the limited source of PUFAs in animals and plants, microorganisms, especially fungi, have become a new source of PUFAs. In fungi, fatty acid desaturases (F-FADS) are the main enzymes that convert saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into PUFAs. Their catalytic activities and substrate specificities, which are directly dependent on the structure of the FADS proteins, determine their efficiency to convert SFAs to PUFAs. Catalytic mechanisms underlying F-FADS activities can be determined from the findings of the relationship between their structure and function. In this review, the advances made in the past decade in terms of catalytic activities and substrate specificities of the fungal FADS cluster are summarized. The relationship between the key domain(s) and site(s) in F-FADS proteins and their catalytic activity is highlighted, and the FADS cluster is analyzed phylogenetically. In addition, subcellular localization of F-FADS is discussed. Finally, we provide prospective crystal structures of F-FADSs. The findings may provide a reference for the resolution of the crystal structures of F-FADS proteins and facilitate the increase in fungal PUFA production for human health.",

In the HGM, Bacteroidota and Bacillota represent dominant bacterial phyla, which mainly rely on the glycans recalcitrant to host digestion to meet their energy requirements. Accordingly, the impact of dietary and host-derived glycans in the assembly and operation of these dominant microbial communities continues to be an area of active research. Among various glycans, mannans represent an integral component of the human diet. Apart from their health effects, the diverse and complex mannan structures bears molecular signatures that alter the expression of specific gene clusters in selected Bacteroidota and Bacillota species. Both the phyla possess variable and sophisticated loci of mannan sensing proteins, hydrolytic enzymes, transporters, and other metabolic proteins to sense, capture and utilize mannans as an energy source. The current review summarizes mannan structural diversity, and strategies opted by select bacterial species of the HGM to forage mannans by focusing primarily on glycoside hydrolases and their effects on host health and metabolism.",

As the content of chalcones and downstream products in native plants is low, the production of these compounds by microorganisms has gained the attention of many researchers and has a history of more than 20 years. The mining and engineering of chalcone synthase (CHS) could be one of the most important ways to achieve more efficient production of chalcones and downstream products in microorganisms. CHS has a broad spectrum of substrates, and its enzyme activity and expression level can significantly affect the efficiency of the biosynthesis of flavonoids.

      "abstract": "Fermentation is one of the oldest known production processes and the most technologically valuable in terms of the food industry. In recent years, increasing nutrition and health awareness has also changed what is expected from fermentation technology, and the production of healthier foods has started to come a little more forward rather than increasing the shelf life and organoleptic properties of foods. Therefore, in addition to traditional microorganisms, a new generation of (novel) microorganisms has been discovered and research has shifted to this point. Novel microorganisms are known as either newly isolated genera and species from natural sources or bacterial strains derived from existing bacteria. Although novel microorganisms are mostly studied for their use in novel food production in terms of gut-microbiota modulation, recent innovative food research highlights their fermentative effects and usability, especially in food modifications.

However, the variety and structural complexity of oligo/polysaccharides represent a major challenge for biological and structural explorations. To access structurally defined oligo/polysaccharides, biological strategies using glycoenzyme biocatalysts have shown remarkable synthetic potential attributed to their regioselectivity and stereoselectivity that allow mild, structurally controlled reaction without addition of protecting groups necessary in chemical strategies. This review summarizes recent biotechnological approaches of oligo/polysaccharide synthesis, which mainly includes in vitro enzymatic synthesis and cell factory synthesis. We have discussed the important factors involved in the production of nucleotide sugars. Furthermore, the strategies established in the cell factory and enzymatic syntheses are summarized, and we have highlighted concepts like metabolic flux rebuilding and regulation, enzyme engineering, and route design as important strategies. The research challenges and prospects are also outlined and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Phytocannabinoids are bioactive terpenoids that are exclusive to Cannabis sativa L. The main pharmacologically active phytocannabinoids are Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, both target endogenous cannabinoid receptors. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol have extensive therapeutic potential due to their participation in many physiological and pathological processes in human body by activating the endocannabinoid system. At present, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and their analogues or combination preparations are used to treat epilepsy, vomiting in patients with cancer chemotherapy, spasticity in multiple sclerosis and relieve neuropathic pain and pain in patients with advanced cancer. With the further exploration of the application value of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol as well as the increasing demand for standardization of pharmaceutical preparations, it is imminent to achieve large-scale production of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol in the pharmaceutical industry. In this article, pharmacological research progress of phytocannabinoids in recent years, biosynthetic pathways of phytocannabinoids and the mechanism of key enzymes as well as various product development strategies of cannabinoids in pharmaceutical industry are reviewed. By exploring the potential of synthetic biology as an alternative strategy for the source of phytocannabinoids, it will provide a theoretical basis for the research and development of microbial engineering for cannabinoids synthesis, and promote the large-scale production of medicinal cannabinoids.",

In most cases, no negative effect of onion dehydration was noted on the growth or number of the bacteria tested. Osmotic dehydration of onions prior to lactic fermentation may positively modify the profile of lactic acid isomers by increasing the proportion of the L (+) isomer. The use of osmotic dehydration before fermentation did not adversely affect the content of polyphenols in the onions. Simultaneously, the loss of fructo-oligosaccharides was limited: 60 % of the initial fructo-oligosaccharide content was obtained using the Alonso cultivar and Levilactobacillus brevis 0944 for onion fermentation.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the increasing incidence of food allergy is considered a major public health and food safety concern. Importantly, food-induced anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening, systemic reaction with varied clinical presentations and severity that results from the release of mediators from mast cells and basophils. Many factors are blamed for the increasing incidence of food allergy, including hygiene, microbiota (composition and diversity), inopportune complementary foods (a high-fat diet), and increasing processed food consumption. Studies have shown that different food components, including lipids, sugars, polyphenols, and vitamins, can modify the immunostimulating properties of allergenic proteins and change their bioavailability. Understanding the role of the food components in allergy might improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of food allergy. This review considers the role of the dietary components, including lipids, sugars, polyphenols, and vitamins, in the development of food allergy as well as results of mechanistic investigations in in vivo and in vitro models.",

      "abstract": "Squalene is a triterpene hydrocarbon, a biochemical precursor for all steroids in plants and animals. It is a principal component of human surface lipids, in particular of sebum. Squalene has several applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and medical sectors. It is essentially used as a dietary supplement, vaccine adjuvant, moisturizer, cardio-protective agent, anti-tumor agent and natural antioxidant. With the increased demand for squalene along with regulations on shark-derived squalene, there is a need to find alternatives for squalene production which are low-cost as well as sustainable. Microbial platforms are being considered as a potential option to meet such challenges. Considerable progress has been made using both wild-type and engineered microbial strains for improved productivity and yields of squalene. Native strains for squalene production are usually limited by low growth rates and lesser titers. Metabolic engineering, which is a rational strain engineering tool, has enabled the development of microbial strains such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica, to overproduce the squalene in high titers. This review focuses on key strain engineering strategies involving both in-silico and in-vitro techniques. Emphasis is made on gene manipulations for improved precursor pool, enzyme modifications, cofactor regeneration, up-regulation of limiting reactions, and downregulation of competing reactions during squalene production. Process strategies and challenges related to both upstream and downstream during mass cultivation are detailed.",

The first part is related to polyphenols' impacts on various microorganisms, especially bacteria, and their influence on intestinal pathogens. The research data on the mechanisms of polyphenol action were collected together and organized. The impact of various polyphenols groups on intestinal bacteria both on the whole \"microbiota\" and on particular species, including probiotics, are presented. Moreover, the impact of polyphenols present in food (bound to the matrix) was compared with the purified polyphenols (such as in dietary supplements) as well as polyphenols in the form of derivatives (such as glycosides) with those in the form of aglycones. The second part of the paper discusses in detail the mechanisms (pathways) and the role of bacterial biotransformation of the most important groups of polyphenols, including the production of bioactive metabolites with a significant impact on the human organism (both positive and negative).",

This study investigated the formation, characterization, and antigenicity of lecithin-β-conglycinin complexes. The results indicate that lecithin was combined with β-conglycinin via static quenching and primarily driven by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. In addition, heat treatment reduced the antigenicity of complexes, as evidenced by changes in molecular weight and secondary and tertiary structures. It revealed that large aggregates developed and more hydrophobic regions were exposed for complexes after heat treatment, as well as a decrease in the β-sheet contents and an increase in the β-turn and random coil contents. Furthermore, the average particle size of the complexes increased with increased temperature treatment, and the morphology of the complexes exhibited an amorphous polymer. These findings shedlight on the interaction between lecithin and β-conglycinin and help us understand the role of lecithin in allergic reactions.",

However, the AF technology suffers from low product titers due to thermodynamic constraints. Recent studies suggest that augmenting AF redox potential can regulate the metabolic pathway and provide seamless electron flow by lowering the activation energy barrier, thus positively influencing the substrate utilization rate, product yield, and speciation. Hence, the augmented AF system with an exogenous electricity supply is termed as electro-fermentation (EF), which has enormous potential to strengthen the fermentation technology domain. Therefore, this critical review systematically discusses the current understanding of EF with a special focus on the extracellular electron transfer mechanism of electroactive bacteria and provides perspectives and research gaps to further improve the technology for green chemical synthesis, sustainable waste management, and circular bio-economy.",

      "abstract": "Keratinases are unique among proteolytic enzymes for their ability to degrade recalcitrant insoluble proteins, and they are of critical importance in keratin waste management. Over the past few decades, researchers have focused on discovering keratinase producers, as well as producing and characterizing keratinases. The application potential of keratinases has been investigated in the feed, fertilizer, leathering, detergent, cosmetic, and medical industries. However, the commercial availability of keratinases is still limited due to poor productivity and properties, such as thermostability, storage stability and resistance to organic reagents. Advances in molecular biotechnology have provided powerful tools for enhancing the production and functional properties of keratinase. This critical review systematically summarizes the application potential of keratinase, and in particular certain newly discovered catalytic capabilities. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive insight into mechanistic and molecular aspects of keratinases including analysis of gene sequences and protein structures. In addition, development and current advances in protein engineering of keratinases are summarized and discussed, revealing that the engineering of protein domains such as signal peptides and pro-peptides has become an important strategy to increase production of keratinases. Finally, prospects for further development are also proposed, indicating that advanced protein engineering technologies will lead to improved and additional commercial keratinases for various industrial applications.",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with complex complications that may lead to tumors. However, research on the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to chronic immune diseases and cancer pathogenesis triggered by the inflammatory environment remains limited. An imbalance in the host gut microbiota often accompanies intestinal inflammation. The delayed recovery of the dysregulated intestinal microbiota may exacerbate systemic inflammatory responses, multiorgan pathology, and metabolic disorders. This delay may also facilitate bacterial translocation. This review examined the relationship between gut barrier disruption and unbalanced microbial translocation and their impact on the brain, liver, and lungs. We also explored their potential roles in tumor initiation. Notably, the role of the intestinal microbiota in the development of inflammation is linked to the immune surveillance function of the small intestine and the repair status of the intestinal barrier. Moreover, adherence to a partially anti-inflammatory diet can aid in preventing the malignant transformation of inflammation by repairing the intestinal barrier and significantly reducing inflammation. In conclusion, enhancing intestinal barrier function may be a novel strategy for preventing and treating chronic malignancies in the intestine and other body areas.",

      "abstract": "The renewable lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable feedstock for the production of bioethanol, which shows the potential to replace fossil fuels. Due to the recalcitrant structure of plant cell wall made of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, the biomass conversion process requires the use of efficient pretreatment process before enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation to degrade the crystallinity of cellulose fibres and to remove lignin from biomass. Proper pretreatment techniques, economical production of cellulolytic enzymes, and effective fermentation of glucose and xylose in the presence of inhibitors are key challenges for the viable production of bioethanol. Although new strains capable of fermenting xylose are being designed, they are often not resistant to toxic compounds in hydrolysates. This paper provides an in-depth review of lignocellulosic bioethanol production via biochemical route, focusing on the most widely used pretreatment technologies and key operational conditions of enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation considering sugar/ethanol yields. In addition, this review examines the relevant detoxification strategies for the removal of toxic substances and the importance of immobilization. The review also indicates potential usage of engineered microorganisms to improve glucose and xylose fermentation, cellulolytic enzymes production, and response to stress conditions.",

In recent years, rational design based on systems metabolic engineering and conventional optimization of fermentation parameters have contributed to the high production of L-lysine. As the demand for L-lysine in the world market is increasing year by year, intensive research has been devoted to efficient productivity and economic production costs. This review briefly explains the biosynthesis and regulation mechanism of L-lysine in Corynebacterium glutamicum, and then outlines the construction, scale-up culture, and product separation and purification strategies of L-lysine high-producing strains. In addition, emerging strategies for the breeding and fermentation of C. glutamicum for the production of L-lysine have been emphatically elucidated. In short, the commercialization of L-lysine production requires chassis strains with excellent production performance, efficient fermentation process, and the development of sustainable purification technologies.",

      "abstract": "The pulp and paper industry discharges massive amount of wastewater containing hazardous organochlorine compounds released during different processing stages. Therefore, some cost-effective and nonpolluting practices such as enzymatic treatments are required for the potential mitigation of effluents released in the environment. Various xylanolytic enzymes such as xylanases, laccases, cellulases and hemicellulases are used to hydrolyse raw materials in the paper manufacturing industry. These enzymes are used either individually or in combination, which has the efficient potential to be considered for bio-deinking and bio-bleaching components. They are highly dynamic, renewable, and high in specificity for enhancing paper quality. The xylanase act on the xylan and cellulases act on the cellulose fibers, and thus increase the bleaching efficacy of paper. Similarly, hemicellulase enzyme like endo-xylanases, arabinofuranosidase and β-D-xylosidases have been described as functional properties towards the biodegradation of biomass. In contrast, laccase enzymes act as multi-copper oxidoreductases, bleaching the paper by the oxidation and reduction process. Laccases possess low redox potential compared to other enzymes, which need some redox mediators to catalyze. The enzymatic process can be affected by various factors such as pH, temperature, metal ions, incubation periods, etc. These factors can either increase or decrease the efficiency of the enzymes. This review draws attention to the xylanolytic enzyme-based advanced technologies for pulp bleaching in the paper industry.",

      "abstract": "Owing to their numerous nutritional and bioactive functions, phospholipids (PLs), which are major components of biological membranes in all living organisms, have been widely applied as nutraceuticals, food supplements, and cosmetic ingredients. To date, PLs are extracted solely from soybean or egg yolk, despite the diverse market demands and high cost, owing to a tedious and inefficient manufacturing process. A microbial-based manufacturing process, specifically phospholipase D (PLD)-based biocatalysis and biotransformation process for PLs, has the potential to address several challenges associated with the soybean- or egg yolk-based supply chain. However, poor enzyme properties and inefficient microbial expression systems for PLD limit their wide industrial dissemination. Therefore, sourcing new enzyme variants with improved properties and developing advanced PLD expression systems are important. In the present review, we systematically summarize recent achievements and trends in the discovery, their structural properties, catalytic mechanisms, expression strategies for enhancing PLD production, and its multiple applications in the context of PLs. This review is expected to assist researchers to understand current advances in this field and provide insights for further molecular engineering efforts toward PLD-mediated bioprocessing.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is an enfeebling disease with a lifetime incidence of 20%. While accumulating studies implicate a correlation between the disease and gut microbiota, data show that not every patient responded to probiotic treatments. To comprehensively assess the potential role of probiotics in MDD, this study first summarizes the current pathological hypothesis of the disease from a life-stage perspective, focuses on the potential role of \"depression gut microbiota.\" Currently available managements are then briefly summarized and novel bio-materials having potential therapeutic effects on MDD are also evaluated. To harness the positive effect of probiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics, clinical evidence and their applications on MDD patients are listed. Factors that may counteract the pre/probiotic applications, such as diet, physiology, gender difference, and use of antibiotics and antidepressants are also discussed. The endocannabinoid (eCBs) system may be promising targets for probiotic therapy. More evidence is needed to demonstrate the hierarchical factors in the complex network driving the disease, and probiotic can be one promising adjunct for patients with MDD.",

      "title": "Extraction of High-Value Chemicals from Plants for Technical and Medical Applications.",
      "abstract": "Plants produce a variety of high-value chemicals (e.g., secondary metabolites) which have a plethora of biological activities, which may be utilised in many facets of industry (e.g., agrisciences, cosmetics, drugs, neutraceuticals, household products, etc.). Exposure to various different environments, as well as their treatment (e.g., exposure to chemicals), can influence the chemical makeup of these plants and, in turn, which chemicals will be prevalent within them. Essential oils (EOs) usually have complex compositions (>300 organic compounds, e.g., alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic acids, saponins and terpenes) and are obtained from botanically defined plant raw materials by dry/steam distillation or a suitable mechanical process (without heating). In certain cases, an antioxidant may be added to the EO (EOs are produced by more than 17,500 species of plants, but only ca. 250 EOs are commercially available). The interesting bioactivity of the chemicals produced by plants renders them high in value, motivating investment in their production, extraction and analysis. Traditional methods for effectively extracting plant-derived biomolecules include cold pressing and hydro/steam distillation; newer methods include solvent/Soxhlet extractions and sustainable processes that reduce waste, decrease processing times and deliver competitive yields, examples of which include microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), subcritical water extraction (SWE) and supercritical CO2 extraction (scCO2). Once extracted, analytical techniques such as chromatography and mass spectrometry may be used to analyse the contents of the high-value extracts within a given feedstock. The bioactive components, which can be used in a variety of formulations and products (e.g., displaying anti-aging, antibacterial, anticancer, anti-depressive, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antiviral and anti-stress properties), are biorenewable high-value chemicals.",

      "title": "Protein extraction from cold-pressed hempseed press cake: From laboratory to pilot scale.",
      "abstract": "During the production of industrial hempseed oil, a press cake is formed as a byproduct, which is often used as animal feed although it contains a high amount of protein that could be used for human consumption. Extracting this valuable protein would reduce food waste and increase the availability of plant-based protein. A protein extraction process based on the pH-shift method was adapted to improve the protein extraction yield from industrial hempseed press cake (HPC). Parameters such as alkali extraction pH, time, and temperature, as well as isoelectric precipitation pH, were investigated in laboratory scale and were thereafter carried out in a pilot trial to explore the suitability for future scale up. The phytic acid content of the extracted protein isolate was also analyzed to investigate any potential inhibitory effect on mineral absorption. A final protein yield of 60.6%, with a precipitated protein content of 90.3% (dw), was obtained using a constant alkali extraction pH of 10.5 for 1 h at room temperature, followed by precipitation at pH 5.5. The pilot trial showed promising results for the future production of industrial hemp protein precipitate on a larger scale, showing a protein yield of 57.0% and protein content of 90.8% (dw). The amount of phytic acid in the protein isolate produced in the optimal laboratory experiment and in the pilot trial was 0.595 and 0.557 g phytic acid/100 g dw, respectively, which is 83%-88% less than in the HPC. This is in the range of other plant-based protein sources (tofu, kidney beans, peas, etc.). PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Industrial hempseed press cake is a byproduct in the production of industrial hempseed oil, which is mostly used as animal feed, but has the potential to become an additional source of plant-based protein for human consumption with a suitable protein extraction method. The extracted hemp protein could be used to develop new plant-based dairy or meat analog products.",

      "abstract": "Walnut oil is extracted from walnut kernels (Juglans regia Linne) or iron walnut kernels (Juhlans sigillata Dode). The percentage of oil in walnuts is 52%-70%. The main constituents in oil are fatty acids, phenols, sterols, squalene, melatonin, vitamins, and minerals. Many extraction methods such as supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, maceration, modified \"bligh and dyer extraction,\" aqueous enzymatic extraction, ultrasonic extraction, soxhlet extraction, and cold-press extraction methods are reported in the literature. Walnut oil showed anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic activities. The reported data in the literature suggest that walnut oil has many health benefits. This review summarizes the extraction methods, bioactive constituents, health benefits, and pharmacological actions of walnut oil. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Walnut oil is a natural vegetable oil of significant importance due to their nutritional, and intelligence-boosting benefits. Several factors, including the processing parameters and the phytochemical profile, affect walnut oil products' flavor and color. In addition, storage environment of walnut oil can also affect walnut oil quality. Apart from the predominant ingredient fatty acids, the chemical composition of walnut oil comprises phenols, sterols, squalene, melatonin, vitamins, and minerals. These bioactive compounds are of potential value owing to their health-promoting benefits, including antioxidant, antitumor, and cholesterol-lowering effects. Many chemical constituents were isolated from walnut oil; however, all the compounds are not explored for their possible medicinal value. Thus, clinical studies, exploration of the therapeutic potential and the molecular mechanisms of all the compounds, and development of convenient dosage forms either for therapeutic or functional food purposes are warranted.",

      "abstract": "Silymarin and milk thistle oil have unique biological benefits; however, applying silymarin to milk thistle oil remains a challenge. In this research, the content of silymarin in milk thistle oil conditions using enzyme-mediated solvent extraction was investigated and optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal extraction conditions using enzyme-mediated solvent extraction were as follows: the enzyme-added content was 3.06 mg/mL, the enzymatic hydrolysis temperature was 55.09 °C, and the enzymatic hydrolysis time was 66.28 min. Oil extracted by the enzyme-mediated assisted solvent was further compared with those extracted with n-hexane and cold pressing. Results indicated that the oil extraction using the enzyme-mediated assisted solvent had a lower acid value (2.20 ± 0.01 mg/g) and the highest α-tocopherol content (0.62 ± 0.00 mg/g), total phenols (7.67 ± 0.01 mg/g), and flavonoids (1.06 ± 0.13 mg/g). Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity of milk thistle oils was further investigated. The results showed that the enzyme-mediated assisted solvent-extracted oil had the strongest antioxidant capacity with lower lipid oxide content. Therefore, enzyme-mediated solvent extraction is an excellent method for extracting milk thistle oil.",

      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of different roasting profiles (time/temperature) and brewing methods on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coffee brews. Cold brewing (dripping and immersion) and hot brewing (French press) methods were studied to understand the effects of water temperature and technical brewing method conditions on the chemical compound extraction in coffees roasted at high-temperature short time (HTST) and low-temperature long time (LTLT). The results showed that coffee beverages were clearly differentiated concerning the roasting profile when hot water was used (90 ± 3 °C) in brewing. Separation of beverages according to the water temperature used in brewing was observed. Notably, hot brewing coffees were distinguished from cold brewing (19 ± 2 °C) based on a higher titratable acidity and abundance of some furan compounds. The non-volatile extraction rate increased at higher brewing temperatures. At the same brewing temperature, dripping exhibited a higher extraction rate than immersion brewing, which suggests that the coffee extraction process is affected by the design and operation of the cold brewing system. Coffee beverages brewed with HTST and cold dripping displayed the highest value in total dissolved solids (TDS), extraction yield, as well as the highest caffeine, trigonelline, 4- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) contents. Regardless of the roasting profile, coffees brewed by cold dripping were perceived with more bitter and roasted flavors. In contrast, cold immersion and hot coffee beverages showed remarkable sweetness, nutty, caramel, and malt attributes. In turn, these attributes showed an inverse correlation with caffeine concentration, trigonelline, CQAs, and TDS. The findings of this study demonstrate that volatile and non-volatile compounds present in roasted coffee depend on time-temperature roasting conditions; in turn, their presence in the resulting beverages are related to the extraction of the operational conditions of coffee brewing methods.",

      "abstract": "Avocado is a subtropical/tropical fruit with creamy texture, peculiar flavor, and high nutritional value. Due to its high oil content, a significant quantity of avocado fruit is used for the production of oil using different methods. Avocado oil is rich in lipid-soluble bioactive compounds, but their content depends on different factors. Several phytochemicals in the oil have been linked to prevention of cancer, age-related macular degeneration, and cardiovascular diseases and therefore have generated an increase in consumer demand for avocado oil. The aim of this review is to critically and systematically analyze the worldwide production and commercialization of avocado oil, its extraction methods, changes in its fat-soluble phytochemical content, health benefits, and new trends and applications. There is a lack of information on the production and commercialization of the different types of avocado oil, but there are abundant data on extraction methods using solvents, centrifugation-assisted aqueous extraction, mechanical extraction by cold pressing (varying concentration and type of enzymes, temperature and time of reaction, and dilution ratio), ultrasound-assisted extraction, and supercritical fluid to enhance the yield and quality of oil. Extensive information is available on the content of fatty acids, although it is limited on carotenoids and chlorophylls. The effect of avocado oil on cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated through in vitro and animal studies, but not in humans. Avocado oil continues to be of interest to the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries and is also generating increased attention in other areas including structured lipids, nanotechnology, and environmental care.",

      "abstract": "Tengjiao (Zanthoxylum armatum DC.) seed cold pressed oil cake (CPC), the main by-product of the cold-pressed oil process, is mainly used for animal feed or crop fertilizer, resulting in a great waste of resources. To improve the added value, the CPC polysaccharide (CPCP) was extracted and purified, and its antioxidant activity was studied. The extraction conditions by microwave assisted extraction, and purification conditions by trichloroacetic acid and polyamide column chromatography treatment were optimized. High performance liquid chromatography and Fourier transforms infrared were applied to characterize the primary structural features. And the antioxidant activity was analyzed by detecting the reducing power, and scavenging activity on radical of superoxide anion, DPPH and ABTS. The results showed that, under the optimal extraction conditions (liquid-to-solid ratio 44 mL/g, processing time 16 min, microwave power 500 W and extraction temperature 80 °C), and the optimal purification conditions, the extract rate of crude CPCP reached 4.76 ± 0.07%, and the purity increased from 48.52 ± 2.76% to 93.76 ± 2.06%. CPCP was mainly water-soluble pyranose with α-configuration, and composed of five kinds of monosaccharides including L-Rhamnose, D-Glucuronic acid, d-Glucose, D-Galactose and D-(-)-Arabinose. CPCP displayed certain degree of antioxidant activity, revealing the potential development and utilization value as antioxidants.",

      "title": "Essential Components from Plant Source Oils: A Review on Extraction, Detection, Identification, and Quantification.",
      "abstract": "Oils derived from plant sources, mainly fixed oils from seeds and essential oil from other parts of the plant, are gaining interest as they are the rich source of beneficial compounds that possess potential applications in different industries due to their preventive and therapeutic actions. The essential oils are used in food, medicine, cosmetics, and agriculture industries as they possess antimicrobial, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Plant based oils contain polyphenols, phytochemicals, and bioactive compounds which show high antioxidant activity. The extractions of these oils are a crucial step in terms of the yield and quality attributes of plant oils. This review paper outlines the different modern extraction techniques used for the extraction of different seed oils, including microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), cold-pressed extraction (CPE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), supercritical-fluid extraction (SFE), enzyme-assisted extraction (EAE), and pulsed electric field-assisted extraction (PEF). For the identification and quantification of essential and bioactive compounds present in seed oils, different modern techniques-such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-infrared spectroscopy (GC-IR), atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (AFS), and electron microscopy (EM)-are highlighted in this review along with the beneficial effects of these essential components in different in vivo and in vitro studies and in different applications. The primary goal of this research article is to pique the attention of researchers towards the different sources, potential uses and applications of oils in different industries.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the effects of different extraction methods on volatile compounds in flaxseed oil (FSO), we first carried out solvent extraction, cold pressing, and hot pressing treatments of flaxseed [Linum usitatissimum (L.)], then applied the headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry technology to identify the volatile substance compositions, and established flavor fingerprints of solvent-extracted FSO, cold-pressed FSO, and hot-pressed FSO. In total, 81 volatile compounds were detected, including 27 aldehydes, 14 alcohols, 13 ketones, 9 heterocycles, 8 esters, 5 acids, 4 hydrocarbons, and 1 sulfur compound (dimethyl disulfide). Extraction methods had a great influence on the volatile profile of FSO. Solvent-extracted FSO had more sweet, mild, floral, and sour volatile profiles, cold-pressed FSO had stronger volatile profiles of winey, spicy, and fatty, and hot-pressed FSO had green, grass, and plastic volatile profiles. Principal component analysis and Euclidean distance demonstrated that the volatile compounds of three FSO samples could be clearly distinguished. Of note, the cold-pressed FSO and hot-pressed FSO had similar volatile profiles, and they were different from solvent-extracted FSO. This study could provide some guidance for improving the flavor quality of FSO and selecting the proper extraction method for FSO productions. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Practical Application: This study shows extraction methods significantly affect the formation of aroma characteristics in flaxseed oil (FSO), and it provides theoretical guidance for production to use the appropriate extraction methods for high-quality FSO.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand for minimally processed foods that offer health benefits and premium sensory characteristics. This trend has led to increased consumption of virgin (VOs) and cold-pressed (CPOs) oils, which are rich sources of bioactive substances. To meet consumer needs for new oil products conferring multi-functional properties over a longer storage period, the scientific community has been revisiting traditional enrichment practices while exploring novel fortification technologies. In the last four years, the interest has been growing faster; an ascending number of annually published studies are about the addition of different plant materials, agri-food by-products, or wastes (intact or extracts) to VOs and CPOs using traditional or innovative fortification processes. Considering this trend, the present review aims to provide an overview and summarize the key findings from relevant papers that were retrieved from extensively searched databases. Our meta-analysis focuses on exposing the most recent trends regarding the exploitation of VOs and CPOs as substrates, the fortification agents and their form of use, as well as the fortification technologies employed. The review critically discusses possible health claim and labeling issues and highlights some chemical and microbial safety concerns along with authenticity issues and gaps in quality specifications that manufacturers have yet to address. All these aspects are examined from the perspective of developing new oil products with well-balanced techno-, senso- and bio-functional characteristics.",

      "title": "Novel seeds pretreatment techniques: effect on oil quality and antioxidant properties: a review.",
      "abstract": "Seed oil quality is a function of several attributes which include its bioactive compounds, physicochemical and functional properties. These quality attributes are important in seed oil processing as they determine the oil palatability, nutritional and market value. Besides the health, environmental and economic issues related to seed oil extraction using organic solvents such as hexane, other conventional seed oil extraction techniques such as supercritical fluid extraction, enzyme digestion and cold pressing are associated with low recovery of oil and bioactive compounds. Application of novel seeds pretreatments techniques such as microwaving, enzymatic digestion, pulsed electric field and ultrasonication do not only improve the oil yield and quality attributes, but also reduces seed oil extraction time, solvent and energy consumption. Higher phenolic compounds, carotenoids, tocopherols, phytosterols and antioxidant properties in oil from pretreated seeds offer health benefits related to the prevention of cancer, diabetes, obesity, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Increased consumer interest in functional foods and the potential of seeds pretreatments in enhancing the extractability of bioactive compounds from plant material has increased the application of novel pretreatment techniques on diverse oilseeds. This review describes the commonly studied novel seeds pretreatment techniques and critically discusses their influence on the oil physicochemical attributes, oxidation indices, bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of three extraction methods, including cold pressing (CP), microwave pretreatment pressing (MP), and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), on the yield, physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds content, and antioxidant properties of pumpkin seed oil (PSO). Furthermore, the correlation between bioactive compounds and the antioxidant properties of PSO was determined. The results revealed that the yield of PSO extracted using the three methods was in the order of SFE > MP > CP. Additionally, the PSO generated by SFE showed the highest unsaturated fatty acid content, followed by MP and CP. Additionally, MP-PSO exhibited the highest acid value and saponification value, while SFE-PSO displayed the highest moisture content, peroxide value, and iodine value. Moreover, the PSO generated by MP demonstrated superior antioxidant properties compared to that of PSOs from CP and SFE in the oxidation induction, DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS tests. Finally, the correlation analysis revealed that specific types of bioactive compounds, such as β-sitosterol and γ-tocopherol, were highly correlated with the antioxidant properties of PSOs. Consequently, this study provides comprehensive knowledge regarding PSO extraction, physicochemical properties, bioactive compound extraction, and the correlated antioxidant properties.",

      "title": "Functional Proteins from Biovalorization of Peanut Meal: Advances in Process Technology and Applications.",
      "abstract": "Environmental costs associated with meat production have necessitated researchers and food manufacturers to explore alternative sources of high-quality protein, especially from plant origin. Proteins from peanuts and peanut-by products are high-quality, matching industrial standards and nutritional requirements. This review contributes to recent developments in the production of proteins from peanut and peanut meal. Conventional processing techniques such as hot-pressing kernels, use of solvents in oil removal, and employing harsh acids and alkalis denature the protein and damage its functional properties, limiting its use in food formulations. Controlled hydrolysis (degree of hydrolysis between 1 and 10%) using neutral and alkaline proteases can extract proteins and improve peanut proteins' functional properties, including solubility, emulsification, and foaming activity. Peanut proteins can potentially be incorporated into meat analogues, bread, soups, confectionery, frozen desserts, and cakes. Recently, pretreatment techniques (microwave, ultrasound, high pressure, and atmospheric cold plasma) have been explored to enhance protein extraction and improve protein functionalities. However, most of the literature on physicochemical pretreatment techniques has been limited to the lab scale and has not been analysed at the pilot scale. Peanut-derived peptides also exhibit antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, and anti-thrombotic properties. There exists a potential to incorporate these peptides into high-fat foods to retard oxidation. These peptides can also be consumed as dietary supplements for regulating blood pressure. Further research is required to analyse the sensory attributes and shelf lives of these novel products. In addition, animal models or clinical trials need to be conducted to validate these results on a larger scale.",

      "abstract": "Currently, society demands natural healthy foods with improved nutritional characteristics. Accordingly, poppies (Papaver somniferum) are a traditional crop, cultivated for food and pharmaceutical purposes, whose seeds meet consumers’ preferences, making them a promising candidate for incorporation into the formulation of novel functional foods. This work performed an overall chemical characterization of poppy seeds, cold-pressed oil, and press cake, a by-product of the oil industry. The proximate composition, fatty acids, and vitamin E profiles of the oil fraction were analysed with respect to the whole seeds and the cake. The cold-press oil extracted from the poppy seeds was also characterized. Since poppy cake is a partially defatted product, it has a lower fat content than the seeds, but higher content of the rest of its elements, namely, ash (10%), protein (26%), and fibre (38%). Regarding protein composition, the major amino acid in the cake and seeds was determined to be glutamic acid (59 and 36 mg/g, respectively). All the samples presented α- and γ-tocopherols (>21 and >25 mg/kg, respectively) and the fatty acids profile of the oil fraction was mainly composed of unsaturated fatty acids, where linoleic acid predominates (>50%). The oil’s oxidative stability was low (2.8 h), according to the predominance of unsaturated fatty acids. Thus, poppy cake may be considered as an ingredient with great potential for incorporation into products in the food industry according to its high content in protein and fibre, and the remaining fat content, where polyunsaturated fatty acids predominate.",

      "abstract": "Our findings provide new insights into how integrating advanced extraction methods with nanotechnology enhances essential oil stability, bioavailability, and safety, offering significant potential for sustainable pharmaceutical, therapeutic, and environmental applications Essential oils (EOs), volatile secondary metabolites extracted from plant parts such as leaves, seeds, and roots, are gaining prominence due to their broad therapeutic potential-including antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Conventional extraction techniques like steam distillation and cold pressing typically yield 0.1-2.0% EO depending on plant species, part used, and method applied. However, EOs suffer from physicochemical limitations such as volatility, oxidative instability, and low bioavailability, which restrict their direct application in pharmaceutical and consumer products. Recent advances in nanotechnology-particularly nanoemulsions, liposomes, and polymeric nanoparticles-have demonstrated the ability to enhance EO bioavailability by up to 40%, prolong release times, and improve chemical stability under environmental stress. These encapsulation systems also reduce cytotoxicity and degradation while facilitating targeted delivery. This review critically evaluates modern EO extraction strategies, including green and sustainable approaches, and discusses nanoencapsulation technologies that optimize EO functionality. The emphasis focuses on safety considerations, physicochemical enhancements, and the translational potential of integrating EO-nanotechnology in medical and environmental applications.",

      "abstract": "This was the first study to compare the key aroma-active compounds that contributed to the different aroma profiles between roasted and cold-pressed sesame oils. Aroma compounds were extracted by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction (HS-SPME) and simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE) and were analysed using gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS) and aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA). The numbers of aroma-active compounds with the flavour dilution (FD) factors between 1 and 2048 were 57 and 16 in the roasted and cold-pressed sesame oils, respectively. A total of 28 volatile compounds were identified as aroma-active compounds in sesame oils for the first time. Important aroma compounds (FD ≥ 8) were quantified by the external standard method, and their odour activity values (OAV) were calculated as the ratio of their concentrations to odour thresholds in oil. The numbers of key aroma-active compounds defined by OAVs ≥ 1 were 23 (OAVs = 1-385) and 8 (OAVs = 1-42), respectively, in the roasted and cold-pressed sesame oils. 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol (smoked, 1924 µg/kg, OAV = 385), 2-methoxyphenol (smoked, 1488 µg/kg, OAV = 114) and pyrazines (roasted and nutty, 578-22750 µg/kg, OAV = 1-67) were the most important aroma-active compounds in the roasted sesame oil, whereas hexanal (green and fruity, 3094 µg/kg, OAV = 42) was the most important aroma-active compound in the cold-pressed sesame oil, followed by (E,E)-2,4-decadienal (earthy, 4170 µg/kg, OAV = 31), dimethyl sulfone (sulphur-like, 406 µg/kg, OAV = 20) and octanal (green and fruity, 901 µg/kg, OAV = 16).

      "title": "Methods used for extraction of plant volatiles have potential to preserve truffle aroma: A review.",
      "abstract": "Truffles are considered one of the world's most highly prized foods mainly due to their desirable organoleptic properties and rarity. However, truffles are seasonal (harvested mostly in winter from June to August in the Southern Hemisphere and from December to February in the Northern Hemisphere) and extremely perishable. Truffles deteriorate rapidly showing undesirable changes within 10 days from harvest in aroma and visual appearance after harvest. The very short postharvest shelf life (about 7-10 days) limits the potential for export and domestic consumption all year round. Several preservation methods have been studied to prolong their shelf life without the loss of aroma. However, all traditional preservation techniques have their own shortcomings and remain challenging. The extraction of natural truffle aroma volatiles for food applications could be a potential alternative to replace the existing synthetic flavoring used for processed truffle products. Four commonly used extraction methods for recovering volatile compounds from plants, namely, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, Soxhlet extraction, distillation, and cold pressing, are critically analyzed. Up to date, existing research about the extraction of aroma volatiles from truffles is limited in the literature but based on the volatility of the key truffle volatile compounds, supercritical carbon dioxide extraction may offer the best possibility so that a natural truffle-based product that can be used in food applications throughout the year can be made available.",

      "title": "Mushroom oils: A review of their production, composition, and potential applications.",
      "abstract": "This review delves into the world of mushroom oils, highlighting their production, composition, and versatile applications. Despite mushrooms' overall low lipid content, their fatty acid composition, rich in essential fatty acids like linoleic acid and oleic acid, proves nutritionally significant. Variations in fatty acid profiles across mushroom species and the prevalence of unsaturated fats contribute to their cardiovascular health benefits. The exploration extends to mushroom essential oils, revealing diverse volatile compounds through extraction methods like hydrodistillation and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE). The identification of 1-octen-3-ol as a key contributor to the distinct \"mushroom flavor\" adds a nuanced perspective. The focus broadens to applications, encompassing culinary and industrial uses with techniques like cold pressing and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). Mushroom oils, with their unique nutritional and flavor profiles, enhance gastronomic experiences. Non-food applications in cosmetics and biofuels underscore the oils' versatility. The nutritional composition, enriched with essential fatty acids, bioactive compositions, and trace elements, is explored for potential health benefits. Bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds and terpenes contribute to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, positioning mushroom oils as nutritional powerhouses. In short, this concise review synthesizes the intricate world of mushroom oils, emphasizing their nutritional significance, extraction methodologies, and potential health benefits. The comprehensive overview underscores mushroom oils as a promising area for further exploration and utilization. The characteristics of mushroom biomass oil for the use in various industries are influenced by the mushroom species, chemical composition, biochemical synthesis of mushroom, and downstream processes including extraction, purification and characterization. Therefore, further research and exploration need to be done to achieve a circular bioeconomy with the integration of SDGs, waste reduction, and economic stimulation, to fully utilize the benefits of mushroom, a valuable gift of nature.",

The findings proved that the extracted oils were characterized by high nutritional values, which encourages their use in various fields. Results showed significant differences between the obtained oils. Overall, jujube seed oil exhibited the best quality parameters, with acidity equal to 0.762 versus 1% for the moringa and milk thistle seed oils. Milk thistle seed oil showed absorbance in the UV-C (100-290 nm), UV-B (290-320 nm), and UV-A (320-400 nm) ranges, while the moringa and jujube seed oils showed absorbance only in the UV-B and UV-A ranges. Concerning bioactive compounds, jujube seed oil presented the highest content of polyphenols, which promoted a good scavenging capacity (90% at 10 µg/mL) compared to the moringa and milk thistle seed oils. Assessing the thermal properties of the obtained oils showed the presence of four groups of triglycerides in the moringa and milk thistle seed oils, and two groups of triglycerides in the jujube seed oil. The thermograms were constant at temperatures above 10 °C for milk thistle seed oil, 15 °C for jujube seed oil, and 30 °C for moringa seed oil, which corresponded to complete liquefaction of the oils.

      "abstract": "Ethanol (Et) has been suggested as a substitute for hexane (Hx) for use in the extraction of oils from different oleaginous matrices. In this study, Et and Hx were used to extract the residual oil present in a peanut press cake (PPC). Certain variables, such as temperature, solid/solvent ratio and the number of contact stages, in the sequential cross-current extraction process were evaluated; additionally, the effects of these variables on oils (POEt and POHx) and defatted solids (DSEt and DSHx) were explored. Hx exhibited an extraction yield of 86 ± 2% in two stages at 55 °C and a solid/solvent mass ratio of 1/4. Compared with Hx extraction, to achieve an Et extraction yield of 87 ± 4%, it was necessary to use a higher temperature (75 °C), a greater amount of solvent (solid/solvent ratio of 1/5) and a greater number of contact stages (3). POEt and POHx presented compositions in terms of fatty acids and triacylglycerols and physical properties similar to that of cold-pressed peanut oil (CPPO). POEt showed a more intense green/yellow hue and higher free acidity (1.47 ± 0.03%) than POHx and CPPO (0.82 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.02 free acidity mass %, respectively), indicating that the deacidification and bleaching steps in refining should be encumbered. DSEt and DSHx exhibited high protein contents (>45% by mass) and nitrogen solubilities (86 ± 6 and 98 ± 1%, respectively), indicating that they could be used to obtain proteins.",

      "abstract": "The apricot kernel oil press cake (AKOPC) is a high protein natural by-product of oil mechanical expression with potential uses in cosmetics, medicines, and food. The purpose of this research was to improve the protein extraction process from apricot kernel oil press cake by using enzymatic extraction (EEP), aqueous extraction (AEP), and ultrasound extraction (UEP) process. Protein extraction by AEP was facilitated by a low solid-liquid ratio (SLR) (1:15.97) and prolonged reaction durations (3.30 h), resulting in extraction yields of 68%. When compared to the AEP by similar reaction time, increased enzyme utilization (0.90%) in the EEP resulted in greater protein extraction yields (70%) in a shorter reaction time. In addition to AEP and EEP, ultrasound extraction was also used to improve protein extractability. Temperature (50°C), power density (225 W/L), and extraction duration (20 min) were shown to be the best extraction points. Protein yield was found to be 56.47% at ideal UEP conditions. The experimental values for these reactions were found to be equivalent to the predicted values formed by the mathematical models. When supplementary skimmed milk powder (SMP) was substituted with apricot kernel protein (AKP) in the yogurt manufacturing process, the total solids, average titratable acidity, total protein, and fat contents of the yogurt were increased. In contrast, pH and syneresis values decreased as AKP increased in the resulting yogurt, whether fresh or after 7 days of cold storage. Substitution of additional SMP with AKP in yogurt production might be recommended up to 35%.",

      "title": "Effects of sesame dehulling on physicochemical and sensorial properties of its oil.",
      "abstract": "At present, sesame oil is extracted from un-hulled white sesame seeds by using cold press lubrication machines in local stores in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical properties and safety parameters of the hulled and un-hulled white sesame oils. The fatty acid composition, antioxidant activity, oxalates content, total phenolic content, carotenoid content, acid value, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, value total oxidation value (TOTOX), aflatoxins and pesticides residue, smoke point, color, relative density, and refractive index of oil sample were examined immediately after extracting the oil. The peroxide, p-anisidine, and TOTOX value of the hulled and un-hulled sesame oil samples were also examined periodically. After 7 months, the quality parameters were high and the oil samples were not consumable. Linoleic and oleic acids were the predominant fatty acids in the hulled and un-hulled sesame oils. The results of this study showed that the oil extracted from raw un-hulled sesame had a lower initial quality than hulled sesame oil and was oxidized more rapidly than it during the storage period. Virgin oils contained impurities acting like prooxidants and reduced their stability and shelf life. In addition, the un-hulled sesame oil contained higher amounts of antinutrient compounds (e.g., oxalate and pesticide residues) than the hulled sesame oil. Aflatoxin was not detected in our oil samples.",

      "abstract": "The present research studied the influence of blanching and microwave pretreatment of seeds on the quality of pomegranate seed oil (PSO) extracted by cold pressing. Pomegranate seeds (cv. Acco) were independently blanched (95 ± 2 °C/3 min) and microwave heated (261 W/102 s) before cold pressing. The quality of the extracted oil was evaluated with respect to oxidation indices, refractive index, yellowness index, total carotenoids content, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, fatty acid composition, and 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity. Blanching and microwave pretreatments of seeds before pressing enhanced oil yield, total phenolic content, flavor compounds, and DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging capacity. Although the levels of oxidation indices, including the peroxide value, free fatty acids, acid value, ρ-anisidine value, and total oxidation value, also increased, and the oil quality conformed to the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX STAN 19-1981) standard for cold-pressed vegetable oils. On the other hand, blanching and microwave heating of seeds decreased the pomegranate seed oil's yellowness index, whilst the refractive index was not significantly (",

      "title": "Optimization of Cold Brew Coffee Using Central Composite Design and Its Properties Compared with Hot Brew Coffee.",
      "abstract": "The cold brew coffee (CBC) trend is increasing globally; nevertheless, there is limited literature on this popular beverage. Many studies have focused on the health benefits of green coffee beans and coffee brewed by conventional hot water methods. Thus, whether cold brew conveys similar benefits is still unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influences of brewing conditions on physicochemical properties using response surface methodology in order to optimize the brewing parameters and compare the resulting CBC with the coffee from the French Press method. Central Composite Design was used to evaluate the effects and optimize the brewing parameters (i.e., water temperature, coffee-to-water ratio (C2WR), coffee mesh size, and extraction time) on total dissolved solids (TDS). Physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, volatile compounds, and organic acids were compared between CBC and its French Press counterpart. Our results showed that water temperature, C2WR, and coffee mesh size significantly influenced the TDS of CBC. The optimized brewing conditions were water temperature (4 °C), C2WR (1:14), coffee mesh size (0.71 mm), and 24-h extraction time. At similar TDS, caffeine content, volatile compounds, and organic acids were higher in CBC, while other properties showed no significant difference. In conclusion, this study showed that at similar TDS, CBC has characteristics generally similar to hot brew coffee, except for the caffeine and sensory-related compound content. The model for the prediction of TDS from this study may benefit food services or industries for the optimization of brewing conditions to obtain different characteristics of CBC.",

Delivering drugs to the colon requires considered formulation development, as both oral and rectal dosage forms can encounter challenges if the colon's distinct physiological environment is not appreciated. As the therapeutic opportunities surrounding colonic drug delivery multiply, the success of novel pharmaceuticals lies in their design. This review provides a modern insight into the key parameters determining the effective design and development of colon-targeted medicines. Influential physiological features governing the release, dissolution, stability, and absorption of drugs in the colon are first discussed, followed by an overview of the most reliable colon-targeted formulation strategies. Finally, the most appropriate in vitro, in vivo, and in silico preclinical investigations are presented, with the goal of inspiring strategic development of new colon-targeted therapeutics.",

      "abstract": "Many of the synthetic and herbal drugs, despite their notable in vitro findings, demonstrate insignificant in vivo activity, the majority of the time due to poor bioavailability. As per Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS), one of the main concerns is low solubility and/or permeation of drugs resulting in reduced absorption and poor bioavailability. To overcome these issues, various strategies have been adopted, including the use of permeation enhancers which are also known as bioenhancers. Bioenhancers are synthetic or natural compounds that increase the bioavailability of drugs and nutrients such as vitamins, amino acids, minerals, etc., into the systemic circulation and at the site of action for exhibiting improved therapeutic action. By improving bioavailability, bioenhancers can reduce drug dose, decrease the treatment period, and circumvent the problem of drug resistance. Although numerous studies have reported the application of synthetic bioenhancers, plant based bioenhancers can serve as a better alternative owing to their natural origin. Literature reviews have revealed that plant-based bioenhancers have been used in a wide variety of antibiotics, antiviral, and anti-cancer therapeutics. These can be categorized based on their sources and mechanism of action. This review will provide a systematic and detailed overview of the various plant based bioenhancers and their applications.",

      "abstract": "Bioactive phytochemicals from natural source have gained tremendous interest over several decades due to their wide and diverse therapeutic activities playing key role as functional food supplements, pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. Nevertheless, their application as therapeutically active moieties and formulation into novel drug delivery systems are hindered due to major drawbacks such as poor solubility, bioavailability and dissolution rate and instability contributing to reduction in bioactivity. These drawbacks can be effectively overcome by their complexation with different cyclodextrins. Present article discusses complexation of phytochemicals varying from flavonoids, phenolics, triterpenes, and tropolone with different natural and synthetic cyclodextrins. Moreover, the article summarizes complexation methods, complexation efficiency, stability, stability constants and enhancement in rate and extent of dissolution, bioavailability, solubility, in vivo and in vitro activities of reported complexed phytochemicals. Additionally, the article presents update of published patent details comprising of complexed phytochemicals of therapeutic significance. Thus, phytochemical cyclodextrin complexes have tremendous potential for transformation into drug delivery systems as substantiated by significant outcome of research findings.",

      "abstract": "Garlic has been used worldwide as a spice due to its pungent taste and flavor-enhancing properties. As a main biologically active component of the freshly crushed garlic extracts, allicin (diallyl thiosulfinate) is converted from alliin by alliinase upon damaging the garlic clove, which has been reported to have many potent beneficial biological functions. In this work, allicin formation, stability, bioavailability, and metabolism process are examined and summarized. The biological functions of allicin and potential underlying mechanisms are reviewed and discussed, including antioxidation, anti-inflammation, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, antineurodegenerative, antitumor, and antiobesity effects. Novel delivery systems of allicin with enhanced stability, encapsulation efficiency, and bioavailability are also evaluated, such as nanoparticles, gels, liposomes, and micelles. This study could provide a comprehensive understanding of the physiochemical properties and health benefits of allicin, with great potential for further applications in the food and nutraceutical industries.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, minerals including carotenoids etc. can boost the immune system to help fight off various infections including SARS- CoV 2 and other viruses. Carotenoids have been gaining attention particularly in food and pharmaceutical industries owing to their diverse functions including their role as pro-vitamin A activity, potent antioxidant properties, and quenching of reactive oxygen (ROS), such as singlet oxygen and lipid peroxides within the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Nevertheless, carotenoids being lipophilic, have poor solubility in aqueous medium and are also chemically instable. They are susceptible to degrade under stimuli environmental conditions during food processing, storage and gastrointestinal passage. They also exhibit poor oral bioavailability, thus, their applications in aqueous-based foods are limited. As a consequent, suitable delivery systems including colloids-based are needed to enhance the solubility, stability and bioavailability of carotenoids. This review presents challenges of incorporation and delivery of carotenoids focusing on stability and factors affecting bioavailability. Furthermore, designed factors impacting bioaccessibility and bioavailability of carotenoids using emulsion-based delivery systems are explicitly explained. Each delivery system exhibits its own advantages and disadvantages; thus, the delivery systems should be designed based on their targets and their further applications.",

      "abstract": "Iron deficiency is a global nutritional problem, and adding iron salts directly to food will have certain side effects on the human body. Therefore, there is growing interest in food-grade iron delivery systems. This review provides an overview of iron delivery systems, with emphasis on the controlled release of iron during gastrointestinal digestion, as well as the enhancement of iron absorption and bioavailability. Iron-bearing proteins are easily degraded by digestive enzymes and absorbed through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Instead, protein aggregates are slowly degraded in the stomach, which delays iron release and serves as a potential iron supplement. Amino acids, peptides and polysaccharides can bind iron through iron binding sites, but the formed compounds are prone to dissociation in the stomach. Moreover, peptides and polysaccharides can deliver iron by mediating the formation of ferric oxyhydroxide which is absorbed through endocytosis or bivalent transporter 1. In addition, liposomes are unstable during gastric digestion and iron is released in large quantities. Complexes formed by polysaccharides and proteins, and microcapsules formed by polysaccharides can delay the release of iron in the gastric environment and prolong iron release in the intestinal environment. This review is conducive to the development of iron functional ingredients and dietary supplements.",

      "abstract": "Minerals including calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and copper have several human nutritional functions due to their metabolic activities. Body tissues require sufficient levels of a variety of micronutrients to maintain their health. To achieve these micronutrient needs, dietary consumption must be adequate. Dietary proteins may regulate the biological functions of the body in addition to acting as nutrients. Some peptides encoded in the native protein sequences are primarily responsible for the absorption and bioavailability of minerals in physiological functions. Metal-binding peptides (MBPs) were discovered as potential agents for mineral supplements. Nevertheless, sufficient studies on how MBPs affect the biological functions of minerals are lacking. The hypothesis is that the absorption and bioavailability of minerals are significantly influenced by peptides, and these properties are further enhanced by the configuration and attribute of the metal-peptide complex. In this review, the production of MBPs is discussed using various key parameters such as the protein sources and amino acid residues, enzymatic hydrolysis, purification, sequencing and synthesis and in silico analysis of MBPs. The mechanisms of metal-peptide complexes as functional food ingredients are elucidated, including metal-peptide ratio, precursors and ligands, complexation reaction, absorbability and bioavailability. Finally, the characteristics and application of different metal-peptide complexes are also described.",

      "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a green tea catechin, has gained the attention of current study due to its excellent health-promoting effects. It possesses anti-obesity, antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory activities, and is under extensive investigation in functional foods for improvement. It is susceptible to lower stability, lesser bioavailability, and lower absorption rate due to various environmental, processing, formulations, and gastrointestinal conditions of the human body. Therefore, it is the foremost concern for the researchers to enhance its bioactivity and make it the most suitable therapeutic compound for its clinical applications. In the current review, factors affecting the bioavailability of EGCG and the possible strategies to overcome these issues are reviewed and discussed. This review summarizes structural modifications and delivery through nanoparticle-based approaches including nano-emulsions, encapsulations, and silica-based nanoparticles for effective use of EGCG in functional foods. Moreover, recent advances to enhance EGCG therapeutic efficacy by specifically targeting its molecules to increase its bioavailability and stability are also described. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The main green tea constituent EGCG possesses several health-promoting effects making EGCG a potential therapeutic compound to cure ailments. However, its low stability and bioavailability render its uses in many disorders. Synthesizing EGCG prodrugs by structural modifications helps against its low bioavailability and stability by overcoming premature degradation and lower absorption rate. This review paper summarizes various strategies that benefit EGCG under different physiological conditions. The esterification, nanoparticle approaches, silica-based EGCG-NPs, and EGCG formulations serve as ideal EGCG modification strategies to deliver superior concentrations with lesser toxicity for its efficient penetration and absorption across cells both in vitro and in vivo. As a result of EGCG modifications, its bioactivities would be highly improved at lower doses. The protected or modified EGCG molecule would have enhanced potential effects and stability that would contribute to the clinical applications and expand its use in various food and cosmetic industries.",

In this context, identifying the structures and behaviors of crystals and predicting their characteristics are of great value. Electron diffraction by accelerated analysis of the chemicals and sensitivity to charge alterations, electromechanical tools for controlled delivery of therapeutics, mechatronics via fabrication of multi-functional smart products including the organ-on-chip devices for healthcare applications, and optomechatronics by overcoming the limitations of conventional biomedical techniques could address the unmet biomedical requirements and facilitate development of more effective theranostics with improved outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Amorphous solid products have recently gained a lot of attention as key solutions to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble nutraceuticals. A pure amorphous drug is a high-energy form; physically/chemically unstable and so easily gets recrystallized into the less soluble crystalline form limiting solubility and bioavailability issues. Amorphous solid dispersion and co-amorphous are new formulation approach that stabilized unstable amorphous form through different mechanisms such as preventing mobility, high glass transition temperature and molecular interaction. Nutraceuticals have been received the utmost importance due to their health benefits. However, most of these compounds have been associated with poor oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, high lipophilicity, high melting point, poor permeability, degradability and rapid metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) which limits its health benefits. This review provides us a systematic application of amorphous systems to the delivery of poorly soluble nutraceuticals, with the aim of overcoming their pharmacokinetic limitations and improved pharmacological potential. In particular, it describes the challenges associated with delivery of oral nutraceuticals, various methods involved in the preparation and characterization of amorphous systems and permeability enhancement of nutraceuticals are in detail.",

      "abstract": "Liquid crystalline phases (LCPs) are generated upon lipolysis of ingested lipids in the gastrointestinal tract. The breaking off and subsequent evolution of LCPs produce more advanced vesicular and micellar structures which facilitate oral absorption of lipids, as well as co-loaded drug entities. Owing to sustained or controlled drug release, bioadhesiveness, and capability of loading drugs of different properties, LCPs are promising vehicles to implement for enhancement of oral bioavailability. This review aims to provide an overview on the classification, preparation and characterization, in vivo generation and transformation, absorption mechanisms, and encouraging applications of LCPs in enhancement of oral bioavailability. In addition, we comment on the merits of LCPs as oral drug delivery carriers, as well as solutions to industrialization utilizing liquid crystalline precursor and preconcentrate formulations.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been considerable interest in icariin (ICA) and its derivates, icariside II (ICS) and icaritin (ICT), due to their wide range of potential applications in preventing cancer, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, delaying the effects of Alzheimer's disease, treating erectile dysfunction, etc. However, their poor water solubility and membrane permeability, resulting in low bioavailability, dampens their potential beneficial effects. In this regard, several strategies have been developed, such as pharmaceutical technologies, structural transformations, and absorption enhancers. All these strategies manage to improve the bioavailability of the above-mentioned flavonoids, thus increasing their concentration in the desired places. This paper focuses on gathering the latest knowledge on strategies to improve bioavailability for enhancing the efficacy of icariin, icariside II, and icaritin. We conclude that there is an opportunity for many further improvements in this field. To the best of our knowledge, no such review articles scoping the bioavailability improvement of icariin and its derivates have been published to date. Therefore, this paper can be a good starting point for all those who want to deepen their understanding of the field.",

However, their clinical application is limited due to low solubility, instability, low bioavailability, rapid metabolism, short half-life, and strong off-target toxicity. To overcome these drawbacks, cell membrane-based biomimetic nanosystems have emerged that avoid clearance by the immune system, enhance targeting, and prolong drug circulation, while also improving drug solubility and bioavailability, enhancing drug efficacy, and reducing side effects. This review summarizes recent advances in the preparation and coating of cell membrane-coated biomimetic nanosystems and in their applications to disease for targeted natural products delivery. Current challenges, limitations, and prospects in this field are also discussed, providing a research basis for the development of multifunctional biomimetic nanosystems for natural products.",

      "abstract": "Luteolin loaded zein nanoparticles (Lut-ZNP) were prepared by using sodium caseinate as an electrostatic stabilizer. The formulation of the nanoparticles was optimized. Lut-ZNP were spray-dried, and the physicochemical properties were characterized by SEM, XRD, FT-IR and DSC. Then, the bioavailability of luteolin in rats was determined. Under the formulation of luteolin, zein and sodium caseinate with mass ratio of 1:5:15, the particle size, ζ-potential, encapsulation efficiency and loading efficiency of Lut-ZNP were 171.8 nm, -49.05 mV, 85.85% and 3.15%, respectively. Luteolin existed in the nanoparticles with amorphous form. Lut-ZNP exhibited good redispersibility in water after drying. Compared with free luteolin, the solubility, stability and release of luteolin in Lut-ZNP were greatly improved. Besides, the fecal excretion of luteolin in rats was significantly reduced after oral administration of Lut-ZNP. In addition to native luteolin, its metabolites including sulfate, glucuronidate and methylated glucuronidate were found in rat plasma. Lut-ZNP significantly increased the plasma concentrations of luteolin and its metabolites, and the bioavailability of luteolin was enhanced by 2.92 times.",

However, factors such as poor solubility, low permeability, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux, and hepatic-intestinal metabolism result in BBR having a low bioavailability (< 1%), which restricts its application in clinical settings. Therefore, improving its bioavailability is a prerequisite for its clinical applications. This review summarizes the various pharmacological effects of BBR and analyzes the main reasons for its poor bioavailability. It introduces methods to improve the bioavailability of BBR through the use of absorption enhancers and P-gp inhibitors, structural modification of BBR, and preparation of BBR salts and cocrystals as well as the development of new formulations and focuses on the bioavailability study of the new formulations of BBR. The research of BBR was also prospected in order to provide reference for the further research of BBR.",

      "abstract": "Hydrophilic drugs are proficient therapeutic agents however, delivery of these drugs is a difficult task. Hence, developing an efficient drug delivery system may require a multipronged approach. Colloidal drug delivery systems such as emulsions, liposomes, nanoemulsions, polymeric nanoparticles, and niosomes are known to enhance drug entrapment, bioavailability, and to improve the pharmacokinetic profiles of hydrophilic drugs. However, issues such as drug leakage and burst release are frequently reported with such systems. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were developed as an alternative to the traditional colloidal drug carriers to overcome these issues. Although SLNs have been widely studied as carriers for hydrophobic drugs, delivery of hydrophilic molecules remains a challenge. Hence, the current review focuses on different approaches that have been used for the delivery of hydrophilic drugs using SLNs. It not only discusses various modifications in the traditional methods for the synthesis but also emphasizes modifications of the hydrophilic drugs itself that can help in their efficient entrapment into SLNs drug carriers.",

In this paper, the recent advancements of co-encapsulation systems including emulsions, nanoparticles, microcapsules, liposomes, hydrogels, and related products have been reviewed. The co-encapsulation mechanisms of bioactive ingredients in various delivery systems were illustrated. Furthermore, the release, digestion and absorption mechanisms of bioactive ingredients in the human digestive system were also discussed. Co-encapsulation systems have the ability to mask astringency of different bioactive ingredients and enhance their stability and bioavailability, as well as to maximize the biological function of bioactive ingredients with synergistic effect.

However, the poor bioavailability and instability of fucoxanthin in the gastrointestinal tract have major limitations. Encapsulation is a promising approach to overcome these challenges by enclosing fucoxanthin in a protective layer, such as liposomes or nano-particles.

      "abstract": "Citrus fruits are among the most popularly consumed fruits worldwide, including oranges, grapefruits, pomelos and lemons. Citrus flavonoids such as hesperidin, naringin and nobiletin have shown an array of health benefits in cell, animal and clinical studies, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anticancer, and anti-obesity activities. Citrus flavonoids have limited bioavailability after oral administration, leaving the major part unabsorbed and persisted in the colon. Recent studies have highlighted the important role of the gut microbiota and in vivo biotransformation on the bioactivity of citrus flavonoids. This article discusses the biological fate of citrus flavonoids from the viewpoint of their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in vivo. Many delivery systems have been designed to enhance the oral bioavailability of citrus flavonoids, such as emulsions, self-emulsifying systems, nanoparticles and solid dispersions. The ultimate goal of these delivery systems is to enhance the bioefficacy of citrus flavonoids. Several studies have found that the increased bioavailability leads to enhanced bioefficacy of citrus flavonoids in specific animal models. Regarding the complex dynamics of citrus flavonoids and gut microbiota, the bioavailability-bioactivity relationship is an interesting but under-discussed area. Comprehensively understanding the biological fate and bioefficacy of citrus flavonoids would be helpful to develop functional foods with better health benefits.",

      "abstract": "Amorphous solid dispersions enhance solubility and oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. The escalating number of drugs with poor aqueous solubility, poor dissolution, and poor oral bioavailability is an unresolved problem that requires adequate interventions. This review article highlights recent solubility and bioavailability enhancement advances using amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). The review also highlights the mechanism of enhanced dissolution and the challenges faced by ASD-based products, such as stability and scale-up. The role of process analytical technology (PAT) supporting continuous manufacturing is highlighted. Accurately predicting interactions between the drug and polymeric carrier requires long experimental screening methods, and this is a space where computational tools hold significant potential. Recent advancements in data science, computational tools, and easy access to high-end computation power are set to accelerate ASD-based research. Hence, particular emphasis has been given to molecular modeling techniques that can address some of the unsolved questions related to ASDs. With the advancement in PAT tools and artificial intelligence, there is an increasing interest in the continuous manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. ASDs are a suitable option for continuous manufacturing, as production of a drug product from an ASD by direct compression is a reality, where the addition of multiple excipients is easy to avoid. Significant attention is necessary for ongoing clinical studies based on ASDs, which is paving the way for the approval of many new ASDs and their introduction into the market.",

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology is being utilized in various industries to increase the quality, safety, shelf-life, and functional performance of commercial products. Nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable colloidal dispersions that consist of at least two immiscible liquids (typically oil and water), as well as various stabilizers (including emulsifiers, texture modifiers, ripening inhibitors, and weighting agents). They have unique properties that make them particularly suitable for some applications, including their small droplet size, high surface area, good physical stability, rapid digestibility, and high bioavailability. This article reviews recent developments in the formulation, fabrication, functional performance, and gastrointestinal fate of nanoemulsions suitable for use in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, nutraceutical, and food industries, as well as providing an overview of regulatory and health concerns. Nanoemulsion-based delivery systems can enhance the water-dispersibility, stability, and bioavailability of hydrophobic bioactive compounds. Nevertheless, they must be carefully formulated to obtain the required functional attributes. In particular, the concentration, size, charge, and physical properties of the nano-droplets must be taken into consideration for each specific application. Before launching a nanoscale product onto the market, determination of physicochemical characteristics of nanoparticles and their potential health and environmental risks should be evaluated. In addition, legal, consumer, and economic factors must also be considered when creating these systems.",

      "abstract": "Herbal medicines are being used by humans since the oldest civilizations and have been an integral part of traditional and alternative medicines. In recent times, pharmaceutical and biomedical scientists are taking interest in developing nutraceutical-based medicines to overcome the side effects and adverse drug reactions caused by allopathic medicines. Nutraceuticals have started occupying the global market. Nutraceuticals have gained widespread acceptance due to their efficacy in treating difficult to treat diseases, low toxicity, low cost, easy accessibility, etc. Safety and efficacy are other important factors in the commercialization process of nutraceuticals. Different novel advanced drug delivery systems have been constantly studied to improve the efficacy and bioavailability of medicines obtained from herbal sources. The transdermal drug delivery system provides a potent alternative to the conventional method of using nutraceuticals. The development of transdermal system-based nutraceuticals could provide the advantage of enhanced bioavailability, improved solubility, bypass of the first-pass metabolism, and targeted delivery of drugs in brain-related disorders. It additionally provides the advantage of being non-invasive. This article reviews the potential effects of various nutraceuticals in brain-related disorders as well as trends in transdermal nano-systems to deliver such nutraceuticals. We have also focused on advantages, applications as well as recent United States-based patents which emphasize emerging interest towards transdermal nutraceuticals in brain disorders.",

      "abstract": "Bioavailability is an eternal topic that cannot be circumvented by peroral drug delivery. Adequate blood drug exposure after oral administration is a prerequisite for effective treatment. Nanovesicles as pleiotropic oral vehicles can solubilize, encapsulate, stabilize an active ingredient and promote the payload absorption via various mechanisms. Vesicular systems with nanoscale size, such as liposomes, niosomes and polymersomes, provide a versatile platform for oral delivery of drugs with distinct nature. The amphiphilicity of vesicles in structure allows hydrophilic and lipophilic molecule(s) either or both to be loaded, being encapsulated in the aqueous cavity or the inner core, respectively. Depending on high oral transport efficiency based on their structural flexibility, gastrointestinal stability, biocompatibility, and/or intestinal epithelial affinity, nanovesicles can markedly augment the oral bioavailability of various poorly absorbed drugs. Vesicular drug delivery systems (VDDSs) demonstrate a lot of preferences and are becoming more prominent of late years in biomedical applications. Equally, these systems can potentiate a drug's therapeutic index by ameliorating the oral absorption. This review devotes to comment on various VDDSs with special emphasis on the peroral drug delivery. The classification of nanovesicles, preparative processes, intestinal transport mechanisms, in vivo fate, and design rationale were expounded. Knowledge on vesicles-mediated oral drug delivery for bioavailability enhancement has been properly provided. It can be concluded that VDDSs with many merits will step into an energetic arena in oral drug delivery.",

      "title": "Polysaccharide-based porous biopolymers for enhanced bioaccessibility and bioavailability of bioactive food compounds: Challenges, advances, and opportunities.",
      "abstract": "Bioactive food compounds, such as lycopene, curcumin, phytosterols, and resveratrol, have received great attention due to their potential health benefits. However, these bioactive compounds (BCs) have poor chemical stability during processing and low bioavailability after consumption. Several delivery systems have been proposed for enhancing their stability and bioavailability. Among these methods, porous biopolymers have emerged as alternative encapsulation materials, as they have superior properties like high surface area, porosity, and tunable surface chemistry to entrap BCs. This reduces the crystallinity (especially for the lipophilic ones) and particle size, and in turn, increases solubilization and bioavailability. Also, loading BCs into the porous matrix can protect them against environmental stresses such as light, heat, oxygen, and pH. This review introduces polysaccharide-based porous biopolymers for improving the bioaccessibility/bioavailability of bioactive food compounds and discusses their recent applications in the food industry. First, bioaccessibility and bioavailability are described with a special emphasis on the factors affecting them. Then, porous biopolymer fabrication methods, including supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO",

      "abstract": "Despite advancements in synthetic chemistry, nature remains the primary source of drug discovery, and this never-ending task of finding novel and active drug molecules will continue. Flavonoids have been shown to possess highly significant therapeutic activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-aging, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective, etc., However, it has been found that orally administered flavonoids have a critical absorption disorder and, therefore, have low bioavailability and show fluctuating pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses. A detailed investigation is required to assess and analyze the variation in the bioavailability of flavonoids due to interactions with the intestinal barrier. This review will emphasize on the bioavailability and the pharmacological applications of flavonoids, key factors affecting their bioavailability, and strategies for enhancing bioavailability, which may lead to deeper understanding of the extent of flavonoids as a treatment and/or prevention for different diseases in clinics.",

      "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols, primarily categorized into flavonoids (flavanols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanidins, flavanones, and isoflavones) and nonflavonoids (stilbenes and phenolic acids) are reported to have health-promoting effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, antiviral, and cardioprotective properties. However, their applications in functional food and medications are limited due to their low bioavailability and insufficient systemic delivery. Nano-delivery system conveyances frameworks astoundingly influence the take-up properties of the stacked atoms because the molecule small shape, size, and surface properties of the nanoparticles apply a vital role in the improvement of the systemic delivery of polyphenols This includes nano-emulsion, nano-encapsulation, polymer nanoparticles (NPs), nano-liposomes, solid liquid nanoparticles, cyclodextrins, and polyphenol-loaded hydrogels. Nano-technology is a rapidly developing area that guarantees the improvement of materials with novel measurements, new properties, and more extensive scope for utilization. This review reports the different therapeutic applications of dietary polyphenols, their biological activities, and different nano-delivery systems successfully developed for overcoming the delivery challenges. These applications also seek to improve their bioavailability, reduce toxicity, and enhance dietary polyphenol uptake across the gastrointestinal tract.",

      "abstract": "Poorly water-soluble drugs are frequently encountered and present a most challengeable difficulty in pharmaceutical development. Poor solubility of drugs can lead to suboptimal bioavailability and therapeutic efficiency. Increasing efforts have been contributed to improve the solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs for better pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Among various solubility enhancement technologies, protein-based strategy to address poorly water-soluble drugs issues has special interests for natural advantages including versatile interactions between proteins and hydrophobic drugs, biocompatibility, biodegradation, and metabolization of proteins. The protein-drug formulations could be formed by covalent conjugations or noncovalent interactions to facilitate solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs. This review is to summarize the advances using proteins including plant proteins, mammalian proteins, and recombinant proteins, to enhance water solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs.",

In this study, lentil hulls were subjected to simulated in vitro digestion and caco-2 cell monolayer models to assess the bioaccessibility, transmembrane transport, and a rat model to examine the bioavailability and metabolism in vivo. Polyphenols were increasingly released during the in vitro digestion, and were found to contribute to the increased antioxidant activity. Among the bioaccessible polyphenols, catechin glucoside, kaempferol tetraglucoside, procyanidin dimer and dihydroxybenzoic acid-O-dipentoside were most efficiently transported across the caco-2 membrane, and responsible for promoting intestinal integrity as a result of enhanced expression of tight junction proteins. When ingested by rats, lentil hull polyphenols underwent extensive I and II phase metabolic reactions in vivo, including hydroxylation, methylation, glucuronidation and sulfation. Overall, results of this study showed that lentil hull polyphenols are bioaccessible and bioavailable, and lentil hulls as a by-product can be a valuable ingredient for future functional foods.",

This review will detail the mechanisms present on the ocular surface which impede drug delivery and give an overview of traditional eye drop formulations, as well as methods of improving their bioavailability through viscosity and permeation enhancement. We also review the evidence for more novel technologies, such as nanoparticles, in-situ gels, blood products, and alternatives to eye drops such as drug loaded contact lenses and ocular inserts.",

Its implementation must comply with the recommendations of the French National Authority for Health (HAS) and its deployment is now integrated into the contract for improving the quality and efficiency of care (CAQES). However, although it allows to intercept medication errors, its impact on the length of hospitalization, the rate of readmission and/or death following discharge seems limited. Given the limited human resources to carry out this time-consuming activity, patient prioritization should be considered. Studies on the fate of patients and on the medico-economic issues are also necessary in order to make this activity sustainable.",

      "abstract": "It is common to compare life with machines. Both consume fuel and release waste to run. In biology, the engine that drives the living system is referred to as metabolism. However, attempts at deciphering the origins of metabolism do not focus on this energetic relationship that sustains life but rather concentrate on nonenzymatic reactions that produce all the intermediates of an extant metabolic pathway. Such an approach is akin to studying the molecules produced from the burning of coal instead of deciphering how the released energy drives the movement of pistons and ultimately the train when investigating the mechanisms behind locomotion. Theories that do explicitly invoke geological chemical gradients to drive metabolism most frequently feature hydrothermal vent conditions, but hydrothermal vents are not the only regions of the early Earth that could have provided the fuel necessary to sustain the Earth's first (proto)cells. Here, we give examples of prior reports on protometabolism and highlight how more recent investigations of out-of-equilibrium systems may point to alternative scenarios more consistent with the majority of prebiotic chemistry data accumulated thus far. This article is part of the theme issue 'Emergent phenomena in complex physical and socio-technical systems: from cells to societies'.",

      "abstract": "The impacts of macroplastics (macro-), microplastics (MPs, <5mm), and nanoplastics (NPs, <100 nm) on corals and their complex reef ecosystems are receiving increased attention and visibility. MPs represent a major, contemporary, sustainability challenge with known and unknown effects on the ocean, and coral reef ecosystems worldwide. However, the fate and transport processes of macro-, MPs, and NPs and their direct and indirect impacts on coral reef ecosystems remains poorly understood. In this study, we verify and briefly summarize MPs distribution and pollution patterns in coral reefs from various geographical regions and discuss potential risks. The main interaction mechanisms show that MPs may substantially affect coral feeding performance, proper skeletal formation, and overall nutrition and, thus, there is an urgent need to address this rapidly growing environmental problem. From a management perspective, macro-, MPs, and NPs should, ideally, all be included in environmental monitoring frameworks, as possible, to aid in identifying those geographical areas that are most heavily impacted and to support future prioritization of conservation efforts. The potential solutions to the macro-, MP, and NP pollution problem include raising public awareness of plastic pollution, developing robust, environmental, conservation efforts, promoting a circular economy, and propelling industry-supported technological innovations to reduce plastic use and consumption. Global actions to curb plastic inputs, and releases of macro-, MP, and NP particles, and their associated chemicals, to the environment are desperately needed to secure the overall health of coral reef ecosystems and their inhabitants. Global scale horizon scans, gap analyses, and other future actions are necessary to gain and increase momentum to properly address this massive environmental problem and are in good accordance with several relevant UN sustainable development goals to sustain planetary health.",

      "abstract": "Mosquitoes carrying endosymbiotic bacteria called Wolbachia are being released in mosquito and arbovirus control programs around the world through two main approaches: population suppression and population replacement. Open field releases of Wolbachia-infected male mosquitoes have achieved over 95% population suppression by reducing the fertility of wild mosquito populations. The replacement of populations with Wolbachia-infected females is self-sustaining and can greatly reduce local dengue transmission by reducing the vector competence of mosquito populations. Despite many successful interventions, significant questions and challenges lie ahead. Wolbachia, viruses and their mosquito hosts can evolve, leading to uncertainty around the long-term effectiveness of a given Wolbachia strain, while few ecological impacts of Wolbachia releases have been explored. Wolbachia strains are diverse and the choice of strain to release should be made carefully, taking environmental conditions and the release objective into account. Mosquito quality control, thoughtful community awareness programs and long-term monitoring of populations are essential for all types of Wolbachia intervention. Releases of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes show great promise, but existing control measures remain an important way to reduce the burden of mosquito-borne disease.",

To address the issue, a hydrogel with a core-shell structure is designed for the release of highly water-soluble drugs. The core is used to load the drug and the shell is devoted to isolating the drug from the release medium, which can decrease the drug concentration gradient and the driving force of drug release. The core-shell structure prolongs the drug release time by extending the drug release pathway. Moreover, the core-shell hydrogel possesses high swelling properties to reside in the stomach. The results demonstrate that the customized hydrogel can prolong the release of the highly water-soluble drug (metformin hydrochloride) for more than 50 h and alleviate the burst release of the drug.",

      "abstract": "The scientific community and industrial companies have discovered significant enzyme applications to plant material. This rise imparts to changing consumers' demands while searching for 'clean label' food products, boosting the immune system, uprising resistance to bacterial and fungal diseases, and climate change challenges. First, enzymes were used for enhancing production yield with mild and not hazardous applications. However, enzyme specificity, activity, plant origin and characteristics, ratio, and extraction conditions differ depending on the goal. As a result, researchers have gained interest in enzymes' ability to cleave specific bonds of macroelements and release bioactive compounds by enhancing value and creating novel derivatives in plant extracts. The extract is enriched with reducing sugars, phenolic content, and peptides by disrupting lignocellulose and releasing compounds from the cell wall and cytosolic. Nonetheless, depolymerizing carbohydrates and using specific enzymes form and release various saccharides lengths. The latest studies show that oligosaccharides released and formed by enzymes have a high potential to be slowly digestible starches (SDS) and possibly be labeled as prebiotics. Additionally, they excel in new technological, organoleptic, and physicochemical properties. Released novel derivatives and phenolic compounds have a significant role in human and animal health and gut-microbiota interactions, affecting many metabolic pathways. The latest studies have contributed to enzyme-modified extracts and products used for functional, fermented products development and sustainable processes: in particular, nanocellulose, nanocrystals, nanoparticles green synthesis with drug delivery, wound healing, and antimicrobial properties.

      "abstract": "Despite immense revolutionary therapeutics potential, sustaining release of active small interfering RNA (siRNA) remains an arduous challenge. The development of nanoparticles with siRNA sustained release capabilities provides an avenue to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of gene-based therapy. Herein, we present a new system based on the encapsulation of siRNA/chitosan-methacrylate (CMA) complexes into liposomes to form UV crosslinkable Nanolipogels (NLGs) with sustained siRNA-release properties in vitro. We demonstrated that the CMA nanogel in NLGs can enhance the encapsulation efficiency of siRNA and provide sustained release of siRNA up to 28 days. To understand the particle mechanism of cellular entry, multiple endocytic inhibitors have been used to investigate its endocytosis pathways. The study saw positively charged NLGs entering cells via multiple endocytosis pathways, facilitating endosomal escape and slowly releasing siRNA into the cytoplasm. Transfection experiments confirmed that the crosslinked NLG delivery system provides effective transfection and prolonged silencing effect up to 14 days in cell cultures. We expect that this sustained-release siRNA NLG platform would be of interest in both fundamental biological studies and in clinical applications to extend the use of siRNA-based therapies.",

      "abstract": "Suicide prevention efforts have focused primarily on screening, education, and brief interventions rather than on treatment of underlying vulnerabilities. The Psychiatry High Risk Program (PHRP) is a specialized outpatient program for suicidal youths and young adults that facilitates transitions in care and provides comprehensive treatment aimed at healing and recovery. The authors evaluated the program's impact on inpatient utilization and suicide risk for patients (N=32) who were referred to the PHRP after psychiatric hospitalization for suicidality. Results indicate that program participants had large reductions in depression and suicidal ideation over 180 days postdischarge; they also had significantly fewer rehospitalizations than did a matched historical cohort, with an average savings of >6 hospital days per patient. These preliminary results suggest that a recovery-based suicide prevention program can be feasible and sustainable and may be cost-effective in a value-based system of care.",

One model of care is that adopted by Alfred Health, delivering a multidisciplinary, hybrid clinical and non-clinical (psycho-social support), assertive outreach approach. This study measured improvements in resilience and wellbeing, changes to distress and suicidal ideation at least 6-months post-discharge from care. Thirty-one consumers participated including a one-on-one interview to gather qualitative feedback. There was a significant change on all outcome measures with large effect sizes. Participants had significantly reduced suicidal ideation and distress and increased coping self-efficacy, hope and well-being. The qualitative findings indicated that a key component to recovery was the staff. Limitations included a low sample size, and broad time range of follow-up data collection. Providing assertive, multidisciplinary, collaborative and outreach-focused post-suicidal care can increase and sustain protective psychological factors and reduced suicidal ideation in most individuals.",

      "abstract": "Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), also known as anionic clays or hydrotalcite-like compounds, are a class of nanomaterials that attained great attention as a carrier for drug delivery applications. The lamellar structure of this compound exhibits a high surface-to-volume ratio which enables the intercalation of therapeutic agents and releases them at the target site, thereby reducing the adverse effect. Moreover, the intercalated drug can be released in a sustained manner, and hence the frequency of drug administration can be decreased. The co-precipitation, ion exchange, manual grinding, and sol-gel methods are the most employed for their synthesis. The unique properties like the ease of synthesis, low cost, high biocompatibility, and low toxicity render them suitable for biomedical applications. This review presents the advances in the structure, properties, method of preparation, types, functionalization, and drug delivery applications of LDH. Also, this review provides various new conceptual insights that can form the basis for new research questions related to the drug delivery applications of LDH.",

      "title": "Everything falls apart: How solids degrade and release nanomaterials, composite fragments, and microplastics.",
      "abstract": "To ensure the safe use of materials, one must assess the identity and quantity of exposure. Solid materials, such as plastics, metals, coatings and cements, degrade to some extent during their life cycle, and releases can occur during manufacturing, use and end-of-life. Releases (e.g., what is released, how does release happen, and how much material is released) depend on the composition and internal (nano)structures of the material as well as the applied stresses during the lifecycle. We consider, in some depth, releases from mechanical, weathering and thermal stresses and specifically address the use cases of fused-filament 3D printing, dermal contact, food contact and textile washing. Solid materials can release embedded nanomaterials, composite fragments, or micro- and nanoplastics, as well as volatile organics, ions and dissolved organics. The identity of the release is often a heterogenous mixture and requires adapted strategies for sampling and analysis, with suitable quality control measures. Control materials enhance robustness by enabling comparative testing, but reference materials are not always available as yet. The quantity of releases is typically described by time-dependent rates that are modulated by the nature and intensity of the applied stress, the chemical identity of the polymer or other solid matrix, and the chemical identity and compatibility of embedded engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) or other additives. Standardization of methods and the documentation of metadata, including all the above descriptors of the tested material, applied stresses, sampling and analytics, are identified as important needs to advance the field and to generate robust, comparable assessments. In this regard, there are strong methodological synergies between the study of all solid materials, including the study of micro- and nanoplastics. From an outlook perspective, we review the hazard of the released entities, and show how this informs risk assessment. We also address the transfer of methods to related issues such as tyre wear, advanced materials and advanced manufacturing, biodegradable polymers, and non-solid matrices. As the consideration of released entities will become more routine in industry via lifecycle assessment in Safe-and-Sustainable-by-Design practices, release assessments will require careful design of the study with quality controls, the use of agreed-on test materials and standardized methods where these exist and the adoption of clearly defined data reporting practices that enable data reuse, meta-analyses, and comparative studies.",

To realize the sustainable release of insoluble small-molecule drugs, a new three-phase flow-focusing microfluidic device was developed to produce the drug-loaded sustained-release microspheres which were prepared with bicalutamide (BCS class-II) as the model drug and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) as the carrier material. Under optimized prescription conditions, the microspheres showed a smooth surface and uniform size of 51.33 μm with a CV value of 4.43%.

      "abstract": "Mucoadhesive thermogels were developed by crosslinking poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) based polymers with chitosan and incorporating disulfide bridges, capable of releasing cysteamine upon interaction with mucin, for the treatment of cystinosis. Through crosslinking with chitosan and incorporating varying concentrations of the disulfide monomer into the polymer backbone, the extent of how mucoadhesive the developed thermogels were could be controlled. Through disulfide bridging with mucin, the thermogels released 6 to 10 μg of the conjugate model 2-mercaptopyridine over five days. Utilizing chitosan as the crosslinker, the developed thermogels were shown to degrade to a statistically higher extent following incubation with lysozyme, the highest concentration tear enzyme, by gravimetric and rheologic analysis. The developed thermogels were extensively tested in vivo utilizing a rat model in which materials were applied directly to the corneal surface and a rabbit model in which thermogels were applied to the inferior fornix. With the developed models, there was no adverse reactions or visual discomfort incurred following application of the thermogels. It has been demonstrated that the thermogels produced can be applied to the inferior fornix and release the stable conjugated payload over several days. The developed thermogel was designed to improve upon the current clinical treatment options for ocular cystinosis which are acidic topical formulations that require reapplication multiple times a day.",

This study aimed to investigate stakeholder perspectives on short-stay joint replacement programs, including perceived barriers and enablers to implementation and sustainability, and understand current practices in Australia.",

      "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes. These implications are commonly investigated in either pavlovian or operant reinforcement paradigms, where only the latter requires instrumental action. To parse contributions of reward- and action-related information to dopamine signals, we directly compared the two paradigms: male rats underwent either pavlovian or operant conditioning while dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region central for processing this information. Task conditions were identical with the exception of the operant-lever response requirement. Rats in both groups released the same quantity of dopamine at the onset of the reward-predictive cue. However, only the operant-conditioning group showed a subsequent, sustained plateau in dopamine concentration throughout the entire 5 s cue presentation (preceding the required action). This dopamine ramp was unaffected by probabilistic reward delivery, occurred exclusively before operant actions, and was not related to task performance or task acquisition as it persisted throughout the 2 week daily behavioral training. Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset-triggered dopamine release, that is, the reward prediction error (RPE) signal, as both signal amplitude and sustainment diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to determine the approximate number of hospitalizations of persons without family and the medical challenges they encounter in hospitals across Japan. Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to 4,000 randomly selected hospitals nationwide to investigate the actual conditions and problems, decision-making processes, and use of the government-recommended Guidelines for the hospitalization of, and decision-making support for, persons without family. To identify the characteristics of each region and role of hospitals, chi-square tests were used to make separate group comparisons by hospital location and type. Responses were received from 1,271 hospitals (31.2% response rate), of which 952 hospitals provided information regarding the number of admissions of persons without family. The mean (SD) and median number of hospitalizations (approximate number per year) of patients without family was 16 (79) and 5, respectively. Approximately 70% of the target hospitals had experienced the hospitalization of a person without family, and 30% of the hospitals did not. The most common difficulties encountered during the hospitalization were collecting emergency contact information, decision-making related to medical care, and discharge support. In the absence of family members and surrogates, the medical team undertook the decision-making process, which was commonly performed according to manuals and guidelines and by consulting an ethics committee. Regarding the use of the government-recommended Guidelines, approximately 70% of the hospitals that were aware of these Guidelines responded that they had never taken any action based on these Guidelines, with significant differences by region and hospital type. To solve the problems related to the hospitalization of persons without family, the public should be made aware of these Guidelines, and measures should be undertaken to make clinical ethics consultation a sustainable activity within hospitals.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics exhibit many health benefits and a great potential for broad applications in pharmaceutical fields, such as prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal tract diseases (irritable bowel syndrome), prevention and therapy of allergies, certain anticancer effects, and immunomodulation. However, their applications are limited by the low viability and metabolic activity of the probiotics during processing, storage, and delivery in the digestive tract. To overcome the mentioned limitations, probiotic delivery systems have attracted much attention. This review focuses on alginate as a preferred polymer and presents recent advances in alginate-based polymers for probiotic delivery systems. We highlight several alginate-based delivery systems containing various types of probiotics and the physical and chemical modifications with chitosan, cellulose, starch, protein, fish gel, and many other materials to enhance their performance, of which the viability and protective mechanisms are discussed. Withal, various challenges in alginate-based polymers for probiotics delivery systems are traced out, and future directions, specifically on the use of nanomaterials as well as prebiotics, are delineated to further facilitate subsequent researchers in selecting more favorable materials and technology for probiotic delivery.",

      "abstract": "The potential health benefits of probiotics may not be realized because of the substantial reduction in their viability during food storage and gastrointestinal transit. Microencapsulation has been successfully utilized to improve the resistance of probiotics to critical conditions. Owing to the unique properties of biopolymers, they have been prevalently used for microencapsulation of probiotics. However, majority of microencapsulated products only contain a single layer of protection around probiotics, which is likely to be inferior to more sophisticated approaches. This review discusses emerging methods for the multilayer encapsulation of probiotic using biopolymers. Correlations are drawn between fabrication techniques and the resultant microparticle properties. Subsequently, multilayer microparticles are categorized based on their layer designs. Recent reports of specific biopolymeric formulations are examined regarding their physical and biological properties. In particular, animal models of gastrointestinal transit and disease are highlighted, with respect to trials of multilayer microencapsulated probiotics. To conclude, novel materials and approaches for fabrication of multilayer structures are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Natural bioactive compounds (BCs) are types of chemicals found in plants and certain foods that promote good health, however they are sensitive to processing and environmental conditions. Microencapsulation by spray drying is a widely used and cost-effective approach to create a coating layer to surround and protect BCs and control their release, enabling the production of high functional products/ingredients with extended shelf life. In this process, wall materials determine protection efficiency, and physical properties, bioavailability, and storage stability of microencapsulated products. Therefore, an understanding of physicochemical properties of wall materials is essential for the successful and effective spray-dried microencapsulation process. Typically, polysaccharide-based wall materials are generated from more sustainable sources and have a wider range of physicochemical properties and applications compared to their protein-based counterparts. In this review, we highlight the essential physicochemical properties of polysaccharide-based wall materials for spray-dried microencapsulation of BCs including solubility, thermal stability, and emulsifying properties, rheological and film forming properties. We provide further insight into possibilities for the chemical structure modification of native wall materials and their controlled release behaviors. Finally, we summarize the most recent studies involving polysaccharide biopolymers as wall materials and/or emulsifiers in spray-dried microencapsulation of BCs.",

      "abstract": "In this work, extracellular colored metabolites obtained from the filamentous fungi Talaromyces australis and Penicillium murcianum, isolated in the Andean-Patagonian native forests of Chile, were studied as prospect compounds to increase the sustainability of cosmetic products. The chemical and antioxidant properties of these natural pigments were characterized and strategies for their microencapsulation were also studied. UHPLC/MS-MS analyses indicated that the predominant metabolites detected in the cultures of P. murcianum were monascin (m/z = 411.15) and monashexenone (m/z = 319.10), while athrorosin H (m/z = 458.20) and damnacanthal (m/z = 281.05) were detected in cultures of T. australis. ORAC tests revealed that P. murcianum's metabolites had the greatest antioxidant properties with values higher than 2000 μmol of trolox equivalents/g. The fungal metabolites were successfully microencapsulated by ionic gelation into structures made of 1.3% sodium alginate, 0.2% chitosan, and 0.07% hyaluronic acid.

      "abstract": "Microencapsulation has received extensive attention because of its various applications. Since its inception in the 1940s, this technology has been used across several areas, including the chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Over-the-counter skin products often contain ingredients that readily and unevenly degrade upon contact with the skin. Enclosing these substances within a silica shell can enhance their stability and better regulate their delivery onto and into the skin. Silica microencapsulation uses silica as the matrix material into which ingredients can be embedded to form microcapsules. The FDA recognizes amorphous silica as a safe inorganic excipient and recently approved two new topical therapies for the treatment of rosacea and acne. The first approved formulation uses a novel silica-based controlled vehicle delivery technology to improve the stability of two active ingredients that are normally not able to be used in the same formulation due to potential instability and drug degradation. The formulation contains 3.0% benzoyl peroxide (BPO) and 0.1% tretinoin topical cream to treat acne vulgaris in adults and pediatric patients. The second formulation contains silica microencapsulated 5.0% BPO topical cream to treat inflammatory rosacea lesions in adults. Both formulations use the same amorphous silica sol-gel microencapsulation technology to improve formulation stability and skin compatibility parameters.",

      "abstract": "Due to the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants and their limited stability in response to environmental and processing factors, there is an increasing interest in microencapsulating them to improve their stability. However, despite recent developments in the field, no specific review focusing on these topics has been published in the last few years. This work aimed to review the most recent developments in the microencapsulation of fish oil and natural antioxidant compounds. The impact of the wall material and the procedures on the quality of the microencapsulates were preferably evaluated, while their addition to foods has only been studied in a few works. The homogenization technique, the wall-material ratio and the microencapsulation technique were also extensively studied. Microcapsules were mainly analyzed for size, microencapsulation efficiency, morphology and moisture, while in vitro digestion, flowing properties, yield percentage and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used more sparingly. Findings highlighted the importance of optimizing the most influential variables of the microencapsulation procedure. Further studies should focus on extending the range of analytical techniques upon which the optimization of microcapsules is based and on addressing the consequences of the addition of microcapsules to food products.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics and probiotic therapy have been rapidly developing in recent years due to an increasing number of people suffering from digestive system disorders and diseases related to intestinal dysbiosis. Owing to their activity in the intestines, including the production of short-chain fatty acids, probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria can have a significant therapeutic effect. The activity of probiotic strains is likely reduced by their loss of viability during gastrointestinal transit. To overcome this drawback, researchers have proposed the process of microencapsulation, which increases the resistance of bacterial cells to external conditions. Various types of coatings have been used for microencapsulation, but the most popular ones are carbohydrate and protein microcapsules. Microencapsulating probiotics with vegetable proteins is an innovative approach that can increase the health value of the final product. This review describes the different types of envelope materials that have been used so far for encapsulating bacterial biomass and improving the survival of bacterial cells. The use of a microenvelope has initiated the controlled release of bacterial cells and an increase in their activity in the large intestine, which is the target site of probiotic strains.",

      "abstract": "Microencapsulation is a process where very minute droplets or particles of solid or liquid or gas are trapped with a polymer to isolate the internal core material from external environmental hazards. Microencapsulation is applied mostly for flavor masking, fortification, and sustained and control release. It improves palatability, absorption, and bioavailability of drugs with good conformity. Microencapsulation has been widely studied in numerous drug delivery systems for human health. The application of microcapsules in the veterinary pharmaceutical sciences is increasing day by day. The treatment systems for humans and animals are likely to be similar, but more complex in the veterinary field due to the diversity of the species, breeds, body size, biotransformation rate, and other factors associated with animal physiology. Commercially viable, economically profitable, and therapeutically effective microencapsulated vaccine, anthelmintic, antibacterial, and other therapeutics have a great demand for livestock and poultry production. Nowadays, researchers emphasize the controlled and sustained-release dosage form of drugs in the veterinary field. This paper has highlighted the microencapsulation materials, preparation techniques, characteristics, roles, and the application of microcapsules in veterinary medicine.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the research was to develop microencapsulated powders of bilberry and chokeberry extracts via the spray drying technique. Two biopolymers, pectin alone and in combination with HP-β-CD, were used to preserve the antioxidant, hypoglycemic, photoprotective, and antimicrobial bioactivity of the berry leaf extracts. Moreover, the formed powders were characterized in terms of technological, chemical, and several biological properties. The obtained micro-sized powders (mean average particle diameter from 3.83 to 5.94 µm) demonstrated a process yield of up to 73%. The added biopolymers improved the flowability and cohesive properties of the powders and increased their thermal stability to 170 °C. The total content of polyphenolics in the powders ranged from 323.35 to 367.76 mg GAE/g DW for bilberry and from 186.85 to 227.59 mg GAE/g DW for chokeberry powders; meanwhile, chlorogenic acid was the predominant compound in powders. All samples showed stronger α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 values ranged from 5.00 to 19.59 µg/mL) compared with the reference standard. The study confirmed that spray drying is a suitable method for the preservation of the polyphenolic-rich extracts, while the addition of carriers has a positive effect on the improvement of microencapsulated powders' properties.",

In the food industry, they are increasingly used to replace synthetic additives, aligning with consumer demand for natural ingredients, by substituting artificial flavors, colorants, and preservatives. Microcapsules can be added to a vast range of foods and beverages, including bakery products, candies, meat products, and sauces, as well as active food packages. However, incorporating EOs and ORs into foods and beverages can be difficult due to their hydrophobic nature and poor stability when exposed to light, oxygen, moisture, and temperature. Microencapsulation techniques address these challenges by enhancing their stability during storage, protecting sensitive molecules from reacting in the food matrix, providing controlled release of the core ingredient, and improving dispersion in the medium. There is a lack of articles that research, develop, and optimize formulations of microencapsulated EOs and ORs to be incorporated into food products. Microencapsulated ORs are overlooked by the food industry, whilst presenting great potential as natural and more stable alternatives to synthetic flavors, colorants, and preservatives than the pure extract. This review explores the more common microencapsulation methods of EOs and ORs employed in the food industry, with spray drying being the most widely used at an industrial scale. New emerging techniques are explored, with a special focus on spray drying-based technologies. Categories of wall materials and encapsulated ingredients are presented, and their applications in the food and beverage industry are listed.",

Current management is the prescription of calcium and vitamin D, but the definitive treatment is parathyroid allotransplantation, which frequently triggers an immune response, thus cannot achieve the expected success. To overcome this problem, encapsulation of allogeneic cells is the most promising method.

      "title": "Advances in Controllable Release Essential Oil Microcapsules and Their Promising Applications.",
      "abstract": "Essential oils (EOs) have emerged as natural and popular ingredients used in the preparation of safe and sustainable products because of their unique characteristics, such as antibacterial and antioxidant activity. However, due to their high volatility, poorly solubility in water, and susceptibility to degradation and oxidation, the application of EOs is greatly limited. One of the promising strategies for overcoming these restrictions is encapsulation, which involves in the entrapment of EOs inside biocompatible materials to utilize their controllable release and good bioavailability. In this review, the microencapsulation of the controllable release EOs and their applications are investigated. The focus is on the antimicrobial mechanism of various EOs on different bacteria and fungi, release mechanism of microencapsulated EOs, and preparation research progress of the controllable EOs microcapsules. In addition, their applications are introduced in relation to the food, textiles, agriculture, and medical fields.",

      "abstract": "Ethanolic extracts of propolis and bee honey contain substances beneficial to human health. Mixtures of wall materials were compared in spray-drying microencapsulation of ethanolic extracts of propolis and bee honey rich in bioactive compounds. Maltodextrin and tara gum were used to obtain microencapsulates A, and modified native potato starch and tara gum were used for microencapsulates B. High values of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and antioxidant capacity were obtained in microcapsules A and B, and the results obtained in terms of encapsulation efficiency, yield, hygroscopicity, solubility, moisture, Aw, bulk density, and color were typical of the spray-drying process. On the other hand, spherical and elliptical microparticles of sizes between 7.83 and 53.7 µm with light and medium stability were observed. Thermogravimetric properties were similar in both microencapsulates; total organic carbon, SEM-EDS, and FTIR analyses corroborated the encapsulation. X-ray diffractogram exhibited amorphous structures, and the release kinetics of phenolic compounds presented high values from 8.13 to 12.58 mg GAE/g between 7 and 13 h. Finally, modified potato starch is a better encapsulant than maltodextrin because it has better core protection and controlled release of the encapsulated bioactive compounds.",

      "abstract": "The industrial processing of fruits in the Amazon region, such as tucuma, generates a large amount of coproducts with great nutritional potential. In this work, phenolic compounds from tucuma coproduct almonds were extracted and microencapsulated by spray drying using maltodextrin as the encapsulating agent and verified its antioxidant activity. Phenolic compounds were determined by UV spectroscopy and identified by Ultraefficiency Liquid Chromatography. Antioxidant activity was measured by ABTS and DPPH assay. Thermogravimetric techniques, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, moisture content and water activity were applied to characterize the microparticle. The crude extract and microparticle had total polyphenols of 135.1 mg/g ± 0.078 and 130.5 mg/g ± 0.024, respectively. Caffeic and gallic acids were identified. The crude extract and the microparticle showed good antioxidant activity by ABTS and DPPH assay, justified by the presence of the phenolic compounds found. The microparticle showed spherical and heterogeneous structures and good encapsulation efficiency from the spray drying process using maltodextrin. The results show that the extract of the tucuma almond coproduct can be used as a phenolic compound-rich source and microencapsulated with possible application for functional food production.",

      "abstract": "Vitamins are responsible for providing biological properties to the human body; however, their instability under certain environmental conditions limits their utilization in the food industry. The objective was to conduct a systematic review on the use of biopolymers and lipid bases in microencapsulation processes, assessing their impact on the stability, controlled release, and viability of fortified foods with microencapsulated vitamins. The literature search was conducted between the years 2013-2023, gathering information from databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and publishers including Taylor & Francis, Elsevier, Springer and MDPI; a total of 49 articles were compiled The results were classified according to the microencapsulation method, considering the following information: core, coating material, solvent, formulation, process conditions, particle size, efficiency, yield, bioavailability, bioaccessibility, in vitro release, correlation coefficient and references. It has been evidenced that gums are the most frequently employed coatings in the protection of vitamins (14.04%), followed by alginate (10.53%), modified chitosan (9.65%), whey protein (8.77%), lipid bases (8.77%), chitosan (7.89%), modified starch (7.89%), starch (7.02%), gelatin (6.14%), maltodextrin (5.26%), zein (3.51%), pectin (2.63%) and other materials (7.89%). The factors influencing the release of vitamins include pH, modification of the coating material and crosslinking agents; additionally, it was determined that the most fitting mathematical model for release values is Weibull, followed by Zero Order, Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas; finally, foods commonly fortified with microencapsulated vitamins were described, with yogurt, bakery products and gummy candies being notable examples.",

      "abstract": "Phycocyanin is a blue fluorescent protein with multi-bioactive functions. However, the multi-bioactivities and spectral stability of phycocyanin are susceptible to external environmental conditions, which limit its wide application. Here, the structure, properties, and biological activity of phycocyanin were discussed. This review highlights the significance of the microcapsules' wall materials which commonly protect phycocyanin from environmental interference and summarizes the current preparation principles and characteristics of microcapsules in food and pharma industries, including spray drying, electrospinning, electrospraying, liposome delivery, sharp-hole coagulation baths, and ion gelation. Moreover, the major technical challenge and corresponding countermeasures of phycocyanin microencapsulation are also appraised, providing insights for the broader application of phycocyanin.",

      "abstract": "Being a natural active substance with a wide variety of sources, easy access, significant curative effect, and high safety, active peptides have gradually become one of the new research directions in food, medicine, agriculture, and other fields in recent years. The technology associated with active peptides is constantly evolving. There are obvious difficulties in the preservation, delivery, and slow release of exposed peptides. Microencapsulation technology can effectively solve these difficulties and improve the utilization rate of active peptides. In this paper, the commonly used materials for embedding active peptides (natural polymer materials, modified polymer materials, and synthetic polymer materials) and embedding technologies are reviewed, with emphasis on four new technologies (microfluidics, microjets, layer-by-layer self-assembly, and yeast cells). Compared with natural materials, modified materials and synthetic polymer materials show higher embedding rates and mechanical strength. The new technology improves the preparation efficiency and embedding rate of microencapsulated peptides and makes the microencapsulated particle size tend to be controllable. In addition, the current application of peptide microcapsules in different fields was also introduced. Selecting active peptides with different functions, using appropriate materials and efficient preparation technology to achieve targeted delivery and slow release of active peptides in the application system, will become the focus of future research.",

      "abstract": "Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) (Moench.)) flowers are under valorized byproducts of okra production. They are a rich source of nutrients and have shown strong antioxidant activity. This study has optimized the extraction of phenolics, flavonoids and antioxidants from okra flowers by response surface methodology. The effect of extraction temperature (26.4-93.6°C), time (6-75 min), and solvent volume (18-102 mL) was evaluated. The optimum extraction conditions were determined as 80°C, solvent volume of 85 mL, and extraction time of 61 min. The extract prepared at optimum conditions was then microencapsulated with maltodextrin, gum Arabic, and a combination of both (1:1) using different drying techniques (freeze drying, spray drying, and microwave drying). The physicochemical properties of the resulting products were analyzed and characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The drying method impacted the polyphenol levels and bioaccessibility, physical powder properties, and surface characteristics of the resultant product, while the microencapsulation method mainly impacted the polyphenol content, glass transition temperature, and polyphenol bioaccessibility to a lesser extent. Microencapsulation with maltodextrin resulted in powders with significantly higher quercetin-3-glucoside (90-100 mg/kg), and epicatechin (480-580 mg/kg) content. The combination of freeze drying with maltodextrin microencapsulation provided the highest content of various polyphenols and bioaccessibility, as well as a very low water activity (0.038 ± 0.000). However, the powder was less free-flowing compared to microwave drying and tended to have a lower solubility. Consequently, the optimum drying and microencapsulation method will be a compromise between the different importance afforded to each of the aforementioned parameters.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus which can cause infection, amputation and even death. One of many treatments that can be applied to support the DFU healing processes is by using wound dressings. Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a good material to be used as a wound dressing. However, some of the limitations of BC to be applied as wound dressing are does not possess antibacterial properties and support the healing process. Andaliman (Zanthoxylum acanthopodium) is known to have antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory abilities that can support BC as a wound dressing. This research focused on the manufacture of BC/Z. acanthopodium microencapsulated wound dressing composites and evaluate their potential as a DFU wound dressing with a variety of gelatin composition in microencapsulation. The results of FTIR and SEM analysis showed that the Z. acanthopodium impregnation process in BC was successful. The variation of gelatine that used in microencapsulation affected the morphological and effectiveness of the wound dressing. However, overall, the wound dressings showed good antibacterial effect on E. coli and S. aureus bacteria and accelerating the wound closure process 8 times faster (BCAMc12) on the 17th day compared to wounds that did not receive any treatment.",

However, these compounds are susceptible to degradation when exposed to a number of conditions (e.g. light, heat, oxygen), leading to loss of benefits and hampering their application in food products. Their hydrophobicity also makes incorporation into water-based foods more difficult. Microencapsulation techniques have been applied for decades to provide stability to carotenoid-rich extracts under typical conditions of processing and storage of foods, besides offering several other advantages to the use and application of these materials. This work reviews the recent advances in the microencapsulation of carotenoid-rich extracts, oils and oleoresins from varying sources, evidencing the technologies applied to encapsulate these materials, the effects of encapsulation on the obtained particles, and the impact of such processes on the bioaccessibility and release profile of carotenoids from microparticles. Moreover, recent applications of carotenoid-rich microparticles in food products are discussed. Most of the applied processes were effective in improving different aspects of the encapsulated materials, especially the stability of carotenoids during storage, resulting in microparticles with promising properties for future applications in food products. However, the lack of information about the effects of microencapsulation on carotenoids during processing of model foods, the sensory acceptance of enriched food products and the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of microencapsulated carotenoids reveals gaps that should be explored in the future.",

      "title": "Amelioration of the stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids and bioactive enriched vegetable oil: blending, encapsulation, and its application.",
      "abstract": "Lipid oxidation in vegetable oils is the primary concern for food technologists. Modification of oils like hydrogenation, fractionation, inter-esterification, and blending are followed to improve nutritional quality. Blending non-conventional/conventional vegetable oils to obtain a synergistic oil mixture is commonly practiced in the food industry to enhance the nutritional characteristics and stability of oil at an affordable price. Microencapsulation of these oils provides a functional barrier of core and coating material from the adverse environmental conditions, thereby enhancing the oxidative stability, thermo-stability, shelf-life, and biological activity of oils. Microencapsulation of oils has been conducted and commercialized by employing different conventional methods including emulsification, spray-drying, freeze-drying, coacervation, and melt-extrusion compared with new, improved methods like microwave drying, spray chilling, and co-extrusion. The microencapsulated oil emulsion can be either dried to easy-to-handle solids/microcapsules, converted into soft solids, or enclosed in a gel-like matrix, increasing the shelf-life of the liquid oil. The omega-rich microcapsules have a wide application in confectionery, dairy, ice-cream, and pharmaceutical industries. This review summarizes recent developments in blending and microencapsulation technologies in improving the stability and nutritional value of edible oils.",

      "abstract": "This work is aimed at optimising the spray drying conditions of the phenolic extracts of purple mashua microencapsulated with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) Andean tuber starches. Purple mashua extracts were obtained and spray dried using native and OSA starches of yellow oca, pink oca, and yellow olluco (140°C, 4% starch). The powders obtained were analysed by encapsulation efficiency of anthocyanin (EE), total phenol content, and antioxidant capacity to select the best starch for optimisation purposes. OSA pink oca starch was selected because the obtained powder presented the highest EE. The spray drying conditions optimised were obtained using a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) and response surface methodology. The encapsulant proportion of OSA pink oca starch (2-12%) and the inlet drying temperature (IDT, 120-160°C) were used as factors of the design. The optimised spray drying condition was 160°C IDT and 2% encapsulant; this condition maximised the EE, total phenol content, antioxidant capacity, and solubility and minimised the water activity and hygroscopicity of the powder. The OSA pink oca starch could be used as an encapsulating agent of phenolic extracts because it can produce powder with high antioxidant capacity and high EE.",

      "abstract": "The supercritical fluids extraction (SFE) was used to extract the oleoresins from rosehip, followed by an in-depth phytochemical analysis and the development of two design-customized powders for different food and pharmaceutical applications. The SFE experiments allowed obtaining an oleoresins extraction yield of 11.85%. Two fractions were separated (S40 and S45), with significantly different phytochemical profile (p < 0.05), highlighting the efficiency of extraction of fatty acids in S40 extract, whereas the extraction of polyphenols, phytosterols, carotenoids and polyphenols was favored in S45 extract. The phytochemical profile revealed that the linoleic acid (C18:2) and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) represented approximatively 82% and 58% from the total fatty acid content in S40 and S45, respectively. α-Tocopherol and γ-tocopherol prevailed in both extract fractions, with a higher concentration in S45 (229.66 mg/g dry matter (DM) and 112.36 mg/g DM, respectively), whereas β-sitosterol was the major phytosterol in S45 fraction (118.75 mg/g DM). The S40 fraction was used to design two microencapsulated powders, by combining emulsification, complex coarcevation and freeze-drying. In order to develop new wall materials, with unique properties, the soy protein isolates were used for cross-linked reactions, by using an approach in one step (transglutaminase mediated) (coded as N) and two-steps (heat-induced and transglutaminase mediated) (coded as T). The N powder showed a better phytochemical content, leading to a higher antioxidant activity (5.27 mM Trolox equivalents/g DM), whereas for variant T, the bioactive were apparently doubled encapsulated.",

They are used as natural food colorants and preservatives and have several medicinal benefits. However, their application in functional foods and nutraceuticals is often compromised by their low stability to heat, oxygen, enzymes, light, pH changes, and solubility issues. Spray drying has emerged as an effective microencapsulation technique to enhance the shelf life, quality, and stability of ACNs.

      "abstract": "This study aimed at the extraction and encapsulation of the carotenoids from sea buckthorn fruits and obtaining value-added mayonnaise. First, the carotenoids from sea buckthorn fruits were extracted using ultrasound-assisted extraction. Then, they were microencapsulated through complex coacervation and freeze-drying techniques using different wall material combinations. Two powders were obtained and analyzed in terms of encapsulation efficiency, total carotenoid content, antioxidant activity, stability of phytochemicals and color, morphological structure, and in vitro digestibility. All results pointed out that the carotenoid molecules were successfully encapsulated within the mixture of alginate, agar, and chitosan, with a 61.17 ± 0.89% encapsulation efficiency. To probe the functionality, the powder was added into mayonnaise in 2.5% and 5% amounts. The obtained mayonnaise samples were characterized in terms of phytochemical and antioxidant activity properties with their storage stability and texture, color, and sensory characteristics. A significant increase of total carotenoid content and antioxidant activity compared to the control sample was observed. The addition of powder also led to improved texture by increasing the firmness and adhesion. In addition, the sensory evaluation indicated an improved color and overall acceptability of the value-added mayonnaise. Thus, sea buckthorn extracts may be considered as valuable ingredients for the development of added-value food products.",

Non-Saccharomyces yeasts have gained relevance as probiotics, and in vitro and in vivo assays are very promising and offer a research niche with novel applications within the functional food and nutraceutical industry. Several beneficial effects have been described, such as antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and gastrointestinal modulation and regulation functions. In addition, several positive effects of bioactive compounds or production of specific enzymes have been reported on physical, mental and neurodegenerative diseases as well as on the organoleptic properties of the final product. Other points to highlight are the multiomics as a tool to enhance characteristics of interest within the industry; as well as microencapsulation offer a wide field of study that opens the niche of food matrices as carriers of probiotics; in turn, non-Saccharomyces yeasts offer an interesting alternative as microencapsulating cells of various compounds of interest.",

      "abstract": "Cell microencapsulation is a rapidly expanding field with broad potential for stem cell therapies and tissue engineering research. Traditional alginate microspheres suffer from poor biocompatibility, and microencapsulation of more advanced hydrogels is challenging due to their slower gelation rates. We have developed a novel, noncytotoxic, nonemulsion-based method to produce hydrogel microspheres compatible with a wide variety of materials, called core-shell spherification (CSS). Fabrication of microspheres by CSS derived from two slow-hardening hydrogels, hyaluronic acid (HA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), was characterized. HA microspheres were manufactured with two different crosslinking methods: thiolation and methacrylation. Microspheres of methacrylated HA (MeHA) had the greatest swelling ratio, the largest average diameter, and the lowest diffusion barrier. In contrast, PEGDA microspheres had the smallest diameters, the lowest swelling ratio, and the highest diffusion barrier, while microspheres of thiolated HA had characteristics that were in between the other two groups. To test the ability of the hydrogels to protect cells, while promoting function, diabetic NOD mice received intraperitoneal injections of PEGDA or MeHA microencapsulated canine islets. PEGDA microspheres reversed diabetes for the length of the study (up to 16 weeks). In contrast, islets encapsulated in MeHA microspheres at the same dose restored normoglycemia, but only transiently (3-4 weeks). Nonencapsulated canine islet transplanted at the same dose did not restore normoglycemia for any length of time. In conclusion, CSS provides a nontoxic microencapsulation procedure compatible with various hydrogel types.",

To address this, microencapsulation is an advanced technology in food applications that require optimization of coating component and temperature regime. Gum arabic (GA) and maltodextrin (MD) were suitably combined at 2:1 ratio, which showed good and stable structure as well as successful microencapsulation efficiency of the enzymatic-ultrasonic assisted noni extract. A coating density of 20 % for the GA:MD formula was with highest performance. The heat setting of spray drying was optimized at 175 and 82 °C for inlet and outlet, respectively using response surface methodology with experimental validation of maximized TFC and TSC at 88.3 and 90.3 %, respectively. Noni microencapsulated powder was assessed via a series of reliably advanced techniques such as microscopy, spectrophotometry, diffraction, and calorimetry for structural properties. Noni powder was additionally tested for storage stability, heat exposure stability, and release efficiency in pH condition and in vitro digestive tract. Promising results were obtained with at least one year storage stability, better microcapsule stability at 60 and 100 °C, quite good release at pH 7.4, and suitable release efficiency in digestive tract simulation. These properties of microencapsulated noni powder open further scalability potential and various industrial applications.",

      "abstract": "Microencapsulation, a typical core-shell structure technology, encapsulates functional active ingredients for protection, controlled release, and targeted delivery. In precise nutrition, the focus is on utilizing microcapsule delivery systems for personalized dietary supplements and disease intervention. This chapter outlines the morphological structure of microcapsules, common wall materials, and preparation techniques. It discusses the characteristics of different hydrophilic and lipophilic functional factors and their function as dietary supplements. The role of microencapsulation on the controlled release, odor masking, and enhanced bioavailability of functional factors is explored. Additionally, the application of microcapsule delivery systems in nutritional interventions for diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, alcoholic/fatty liver disease, diabetes, and cancer is introduced in detail. Lastly, the chapter proposes the future developments of anticipation in responsive wall materials for precise nutrition interventions, including both challenges and opportunities.",
