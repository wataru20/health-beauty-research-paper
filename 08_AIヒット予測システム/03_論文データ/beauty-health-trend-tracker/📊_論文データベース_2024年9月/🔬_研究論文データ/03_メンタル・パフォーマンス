      "title": "Stress relief as a natural resilience mechanism against depression-like behaviors.",
      "abstract": "Relief, the appetitive state after the termination of aversive stimuli, is evolutionarily conserved. Understanding the behavioral role of this well-conserved phenomenon and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms are open and important questions. Here, we discover that the magnitude of relief from physical stress strongly correlates with individual resilience to depression-like behaviors in chronic stressed mice. Notably, blocking stress relief causes vulnerability to depression-like behaviors, whereas natural rewards supplied shortly after stress promotes resilience. Stress relief is mediated by reward-related mesolimbic dopamine neurons, which show minute-long, persistent activation after stress termination. Circuitry-wise, activation or inhibition of circuits downstream of the ventral tegmental area during the transient relief period bi-directionally regulates depression resilience. These results reveal an evolutionary function of stress relief in depression resilience and identify the neural substrate mediating this effect. Importantly, our data suggest a behavioral strategy of augmenting positive valence of stress relief with natural rewards to prevent depression.",

      "title": "Present status and future directions: Managing endodontic emergencies.",
      "abstract": "Endodontic emergencies are common in both general dental practices and specialist Endodontic practices. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of endodontic emergencies. Endodontic emergencies can be a result of many different conditions of the pulp, root canal and periradicular tissues. They may occur before endodontic treatment has been started, between appointments when treatment is being performed over multiple visits, or after endodontic treatment has been completed. In the latter situation, the emergency may be very soon after the treatment or it may occur many years later, in which case it is usually a new disease process as a result of the root canal system becoming infected. An emergency can be a stressful situation for both the patient and the dentist (or endodontist) as it is usually an unexpected event. It is incumbent on dental professionals to provide timely assistance to patients who have an emergency, and it is also important to allow sufficient time to manage the situation comprehensively. Management of endodontic emergencies should follow the principles of the 3D's-Diagnosis, Definitive dental treatment and Drugs-and in that sequence. An accurate diagnosis, the first \"D\", is essential so the appropriate treatment can be provided. Diagnosis requires a thorough understanding of the various conditions that can cause the emergency and this can be helped by having a comprehensive classification of the various conditions. The diagnosis should also direct the clinician to the appropriate Definitive dental treatment, the second \"D\". Root canal treatment will not always be required as some cases can be managed conservatively. Other cases may require root canal re-treatment. The specific details of how the treatment are done can also vary, according to the diagnosis. The final \"D\" is Drugs-the use of drugs should also be dependent on the diagnosis and the dental treatment. Drugs should only be an adjunct following the treatment. The clinician must also differentiate between inflammation and infection in order to provide the appropriate treatment and to prescribe the appropriate medication for effective pain relief and resolution of other symptoms or signs such as swelling.",

      "title": "Effects of psychological stress on adverse pregnancy outcomes and nonpharmacologic approaches for reduction: an expert review.",
      "abstract": "Both acute and chronic stress can cause allostatic overload, or long-term imbalance in mediators of homeostasis, that results in disruptions in the maternal-placental-fetal endocrine and immune system responses. During pregnancy, disruptions in homeostasis may increase the likelihood of preterm birth and preeclampsia. Expectant mothers traditionally have high rates of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many are susceptible to a variety of stressors during pregnancy. These common life stressors include financial concerns and relationship challenges and may be exacerbated by the biological, social, and psychological changes occurring during pregnancy. In addition, external stressors such as major weather events (eg, hurricanes, tornados, floods) and other global phenomena (eg, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic) may contribute to stress during pregnancy. This review investigates recent literature published about the use of nonpharmacologic modalities for stress relief in pregnancy and examines the interplay between psychiatric diagnoses and stressors, with the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of implementing nonpharmacologic interventions as sole therapies or in conjunction with psychotherapy or psychiatric medication therapy. Further, the effectiveness of each nonpharmacologic therapy in reducing symptoms of maternal stress is reviewed. Mindfulness meditation and biofeedback have shown effectiveness in improving one's mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety. Exercise, including yoga, may improve both depressive symptoms and birth outcomes. Expressive writing has successfully been applied postpartum and in response to pregnancy challenges. Although some of these nonpharmacologic interventions can be convenient and low cost, there is a trend toward inconsistent implementation of these modalities. Future investigations should focus on methods to increase ease of uptake, ensure each option is available at home, and provide a standardized way to evaluate whether combinations of different interventions may provide added benefit.",

      "title": "G3BPs in Plant Stress.",
      "abstract": "The sessile nature of plants enforces highly adaptable strategies to adapt to different environmental stresses. Plants respond to these stresses by a massive reprogramming of mRNA metabolism. Balancing of mRNA fates, including translation, sequestration, and decay is essential for plants to not only coordinate growth and development but also to combat biotic and abiotic environmental stresses. RNA stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (P bodies) synchronize mRNA metabolism for optimum functioning of an organism. SGs are evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic localized RNA-protein storage sites that are formed in response to adverse conditions, harboring mostly but not always translationally inactive mRNAs. SGs disassemble and release mRNAs into a translationally active form upon stress relief. RasGAP SH3 domain binding proteins (G3BPs or Rasputins) are \"scaffolds\" for the assembly and stability of SGs, which coordinate receptor mediated signal transduction with RNA metabolism. The role of G3BPs in the formation of SGs is well established in mammals, but G3BPs in plants are poorly characterized. In this review, we discuss recent findings of the dynamics and functions of plant G3BPs in response to environmental stresses and speculate on possible mechanisms such as transcription and post-translational modifications that might regulate the function of this important family of proteins.",

Understanding the neural mechanisms responsible for promoting actions focused on benefitting others is particularly important and timely. Here, we review prosocial comforting behavior, emphasizing synthesizing recent studies carried out using rodent models.

      "title": "Exploring the Therapeutic Potential of Ketamine and Psilocybin in Comparison to Current Treatment Regimens for Treatment-Resistant Depression, Mood Disorders, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in the Pediatric Population: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "The stresses of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighted the burden of psychiatric disorders within the pediatric population, revealing a pre-existing need for rapid-onset therapies that have since driven efforts to expand effective therapeutic interventions. In this narrative review, we utilized the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines to direct our report and study selection. We explored the current-state efficacy and therapeutic potential of ketamine and psilocybin in comparison to current treatment regimens for pediatric non-psychotic disorders, including Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), mood disorders like anxiety and bipolar disorder, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). We chose these pediatric disorders to eliminate concerns regarding reality orientation and the use of dissociative and/or psychedelic medicines in patients who are experiencing symptoms of psychosis. Also, we briefly discuss ketamine's more widely accepted utilization by medical providers as a pediatric anesthetic, and how this gives credence to further evaluation of ketamine's multifaceted indications in pediatric psychiatry. Recent studies have shed light on the involvement of glutamate pathways in the pathophysiology of TRD, mood disorders, and PTSD, and both ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, and psilocybin, a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT2A) agonist, have emerged as promising options due to their ability to augment glutamate release. Ketamine's use for pediatric TRD demonstrated rapid-onset relief for signs and symptoms of depression in children and adolescents, and psilocybin also decreased symptoms in patients with longstanding or refractory depression. Ketamine has been well tolerated and exhibited symptom improvements for youth with mood disorders such as anxiety and bipolar depression, while psilocybin showed promise in fostering emotional processing. In youth suffering from PTSD, ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) brought about decreases in PTSD symptom severity, though outcomes varied across populations. Psilocybin enhanced neural plasticity, allowing patients to revisit and reframe memories under therapeutic guidance, especially for those with complex or treatment-resistant PTSD. Ethical considerations are involved in the use of dissociative and hallucinogenic therapies like ketamine and psilocybin in the pediatric population, and we explore some ethical issues regarding their use. Further research exploring specific brain locations and mechanisms of action underlying glutamate modulation by ketamine and psilocybin, and the subsequent rapid-acting relief of psychiatric symptoms offered by these substances, could pave the way for innovative treatments targeting pediatric mental health disorders.",

      "title": "Uses of Energy Psychology Following Catastrophic Events.",
      "abstract": "Energy psychology, as most widely practiced, integrates the manual stimulation of acupuncture points with imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring, and other evidence-based psychotherapeutic procedures. Efficacy for energy psychology protocols has been established in more than 120 clinical trials, with meta-analyses showing strong effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The approach has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in more than 30 countries. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions following the establishment of safety, trust, and rapport are described, including (1) immediate relief/stabilization, (2) reducing limbic arousal to trauma-based triggers, (3) overcoming complex psychological difficulties, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. Advantages of adding the stimulation of acupuncture points to a conventional exposure approach are identified, and challenges around cultural sensitivities and unintended effects are discussed. After establishing a framework for introducing energy psychology in disaster relief efforts, reports from a sampling of settings are presented, based on interviews with this paper's author. These include accounts of relief work with survivors of mass shootings, genocide, ethnic warfare, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of other reports from the field show a pattern of strong outcomes following the use of energy psychology in the days or weeks after a disaster and in the subsequent treatment of trauma-based psychological problems. Many of these accounts corroborate one another in terms of rapid relief and long-term benefits. Finally, examples of more efficient delivery methods utilizing large groups, lay counselors, digital technology, and cultivating community resilience are presented.",

The definition of meditation has many forms, is culturally influenced, and is practiced globally. This literature review seeks to report current literature on meditation related to therapeutic outcomes and create a globally informed definition of meditation for health-related purposes. From a western perspective, mindfulness-based stress relief (MBSR) is widely researched. Therefore, 15 studies from peer-reviewed research from 2015 and 2020 were used to examine various forms of meditation and describe a broader range of meditation practices other than MBSR. The different forms of meditation are: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Portugal), Active Engagement (Portugal), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Adapted Mindfulness Program (Brazil), Cognitively-based Compassionate Training, Loving-kindness (United States, US), Mantra Meditation (US), Mindfulness-based stress reduction (US), Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (South Korea), Osho (India), Psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology (Italy), Transcendental Meditation (Italy), Spiritual/Secular (US), Sufi (Pakistan), and Vipassana (Australia). The review was completed using a literature search method, and all meditation approaches report positive therapeutic outcomes for all participants (n = 768). This outcome enabled the creation of a broader therapeutic definition of meditation that can be applied in clinical practice.",

These clouds of systemic racism and discrimination-encompassing 250 years of slavery, 100 years of Jim Crow, police brutality, redlining, and the resulting high rates of poverty and poorer health outcomes-have created systems in which Black Americans face unequal and unequitable stressful situations. The medical community is now beginning to take notice of this race-based traumatic stress, a term coined by Carter in 2007,",

      "abstract": "The Philippines is transitioning into an aging population. This results in problems associated with the mental health of older people. However, despite studies of depression in later life, there has been limited literature on the experience of those from rural communities in low and middle-income countries. This study examines depression, stress and stress relief measures used, and living arrangements of older adults (≥ 60 years) living in rural areas in the Philippines and compares depressed older adults from those that are not depressed. A cross-sectional descriptive design was employed using interviewer-assisted surveys. Convenience sampling was conducted to obtain data from 410 older people seeking care at rural health clinics across the Philippines. Data were analyzed through frequencies and chi-squares. Those who were depressed accounted for 11.5% of the respondents, while 77.1% reported some level of stress. Their stress relief measures included eating regularly (82.9%), exercise (64.6%), praying (62%), hanging out with friends and family (22%), and getting massages (7.3%). Around a third of respondents lived alone. For overall life stress, those who were not depressed reported that their lives were somewhat stressful, significantly higher than their depressed counterparts. Respondents who answered that work and money were their causes of stress showed significant differences compared to those who experienced no work or money-related stress. For stress relief measures, those who performed exercise and identified hanging out with friends and family as measures to maintain good wellbeing were significantly less likely to report depression. There were no differences among those living alone or older adults living with either adults, children, or both. Depression is an area of concern for community-dwelling older people in rural municipalities. The results of our study suggest the need to develop primary care services such as depression screening, health education and promoting healthy lifestyles, spirituality, stress management, and creating activities that will promote social interaction and maintain a social network.",

      "abstract": "Listening to music is a crucial tool for relieving stress and promoting relaxation. However, the limited options available for stress-relief music do not cater to individual preferences, compromising its effectiveness. Traditional methods of curating stress-relief music rely heavily on measuring biological responses, which is time-consuming, expensive, and requires specialized measurement devices. In this paper, a deep learning approach to solve this problem is introduced that explicitly uses convolutional neural networks and provides a more efficient and economical method for generating large datasets of stress-relief music. These datasets are composed of Mel-scaled spectrograms that include essential sound elements (such as frequency, amplitude, and waveform) that can be directly extracted from the music. The trained model demonstrated a test accuracy of 98.7%, and a clinical study indicated that the model-selected music was as effective as researcher-verified music in terms of stress-relieving capacity. This paper underlines the transformative potential of deep learning in addressing the challenge of limited music options for stress relief. More importantly, the proposed method has profound implications for music therapy because it enables a more personalized approach to stress-relief music selection, offering the potential for enhanced emotional well-being.",

      "abstract": "Manipulation of autophagic pathway represents a tremendous opportunity for designing climate-smart crops with improved yield and better adaptability to changing environment. For exploiting autophagy to its full potential, identification and comprehensive characterization of adapters/receptor complex and elucidation of its regulatory network in crop plants is highly warranted.  Autophagy is a major intracellular trafficking pathway in eukaryotes involved in vacuolar degradation of cytoplasmic constituents, mis-folded proteins, and defective organelles. Under optimum conditions, autophagy operates at a basal level to maintain cellular homeostasis, but under stressed conditions, it is induced further to provide temporal stress relief. Our understanding of this highly dynamic process has evolved exponentially in the past few years with special reference to several plant-specific roles of autophagy. Here, we review the most recent advances in the field of autophagy in plants and discuss its potential implications in designing crops with improved stress and disease-tolerance, enhanced yield potential, and improved capabilities for producing metabolites of high economic value. We also assess the current knowledge gaps and the possible strategies to develop a robust module for biotechnological application of autophagy to enhance bioeconomy and sustainability of agriculture.",

      "abstract": "With levels of stress and anxiety rising among the university community, universities worldwide are implementing animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) on campus. However, to date, little is known about how to implement these initiatives. Questions also remain as to the impact of evaluated AAIs on health and wellbeing. Therefore, this study sought to review the implementation and effectiveness of previous AAIs in university settings. Electronic databases ProQuest Central, Gale and 16 databases within EBSCOHost were searched with key words, such as AAI, and university or college students for relevant articles. Inclusion criteria included primary research studies that measured a health, wellbeing or behavioural outcome. A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria, including 24 RCTs. There was limited reporting on the implementation of AAIs in the higher education setting. A total of 11 different mental health and behavioural outcomes have been summarized, with stress, anxiety and mood providing favourable results. An AAI on campus may provide a form of stress and anxiety relief for the university community. Other mental health and behavioural outcomes require further research to determine their effectiveness. These findings highlight that an AAI on campus could potentially provide a form of stress and anxiety relief, and could be a strategy for addressing rising levels of psychological stress and mental health issues among university students and staff in Australia and internationally.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) poses a significant threat, affecting half of the global diabetic population and leading to severe complications, including pain, impaired mobility, and potential amputation. The delayed manifestation of diabetic neuropathy (DN) makes early diagnosis challenging, contributing to its debilitating impact on individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM). This review examines the multifaceted nature of DPN, focusing on the intricate interplay between oxidative stress, metabolic pathways, and the resulting neuronal damage. It delves into the challenges of diagnosing DN, emphasizing the critical role played by hyperglycemia in triggering these cascading effects. Furthermore, the study explores the limitations of current neuropathic pain drugs, prompting an investigation into a myriad of pharmaceutical agents tested in both human and animal trials over the past decade. The methodology scrutinizes these agents for their potential to provide symptomatic relief for DPN. The investigation reveals promising results from various pharmaceutical agents tested for DPN relief, showcasing their efficacy in ameliorating symptoms. However, a notable gap persists in addressing the underlying problem of DPN. The results underscore the complexity of DPN and the challenges in developing therapies that go beyond symptomatic relief. Despite advancements in treating DPN symptoms, there remains a scarcity of options addressing the underlying problem. This review consolidates the state-of-the-art drugs designed to combat DPN, highlighting their efficacy in alleviating symptoms. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of the diverse processes and pathways involved in DPN pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Debilitating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions are associated with complex multifactorial pathophysiology. Their treatment strategies often only provide symptomatic relief, delaying disease progression without giving a complete cure. Potent and safer treatment alternatives beyond symptomatic relief are sought. Herbal supplements have surely been explored due to their multiple component nature to enhance the effect of western medications. One such well-documented nutraceutical in the ancient Greek, Chinese, and Ayurvedic medicine system known for its various medicinal benefits is Asparagus racemosus. Widely used for its lactogenic properties, A. racemosus is also cited in Ayurveda as a nervine tonic. A. racemosus based nutraceuticals have shown to possess adaptogenic, neuroprotective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and nootropic activity under preclinical and clinical settings without posing significant adverse effects. A. racemosus extracts restore the perturbed neurotransmitters and prevent oxidative neuronal damage. From the available neuropharmacological researches, the physiological actions of A. racemosus can ultimately be directed for either augmentation of cognitive ability or in the management of neurological conditions such as stress, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. The studies focus on the multi-component extract, and the lack of standardization has been a major hurdle in preventing the allotment of reported neuropharmacological activity to one of the phytoconstituent. Herbal standardization of the plant extract based on a specific biomarker can help elucidate the intricate biomolecular pathway and neurocircuitries being involved. This, followed by rigorous standardized clinical trials, fixing dosages, and determining contraindications would facilitate the translation of A. racemosus to a FDA-approved neuromedicine for neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic insufficiency fractures and their treatment.",
      "abstract": "Fragility and insufficiency fractures of the pelvis (FFP) and sacrum (SIF) are increasingly prevalent, particularly among the elderly, due to weakened bone structure and low-energy trauma. Chronic instability from these fractures causes persistent pain, limited mobility, and significant reductions in quality of life. Hospitalization is often required, with substantial risks of loss of independence (64-89%) and high mortality rates (13-27%). While conservative treatment is possible, surgical intervention is preferred for unstable or progressive fractures. FFP and SIF are primarily associated with osteoporosis, with 71% of patients not receiving adequate secondary fracture prevention. Imaging modalities play a crucial role in diagnosis. Conventional radiography often misses sacral fractures, while computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for evaluating fracture morphology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers the highest sensitivity (99%), essential for detecting complex fractures and assessing bone edema. Advanced techniques like dual-energy CT and SPECT/CT provide further diagnostic value. Rommens and Hofmann's classification system categorizes FFP based on anterior and posterior pelvic ring involvement, guiding treatment strategies. Progression from stable fractures (FFP I-II) to highly unstable patterns (FFP IV) is common and influenced by factors like pelvic morphology, bone density, and sarcopenia. Treatment varies based on fracture type and stability. Non-displaced posterior fractures can be managed with sacroplasty or screw fixation, while displaced or unstable patterns often require more invasive methods, such as triangular lumbopelvic fixation or transsacral bar osteosynthesis. Sacroplasty provides significant pain relief but has limited stabilizing capacity, while screw augmentation with polymethylmethacrylate improves fixation in osteoporotic bones. Anterior ring fractures may be treated with retrograde transpubic screws or symphyseal plating, with biomechanical stability and long-term outcomes depending on fixation techniques. FFP and SIF management requires a multidisciplinary approach to ensure stability, pain relief, and functional recovery, emphasizing early diagnosis, tailored surgical strategies, and secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures.",

      "abstract": "This study addressed the efficacy of a 20-minute Chakra Connection to treat self-assessed stress in a group of university students. A randomized, control design was used to identify group mean differences for intervention and control groups. A convenience sample of university students was randomly assigned to an intervention (Healing Touch Chakra Connection) or control (Healing Touch Video) group. Self-assessed stress, blood pressure, cortisol, and IL6 were collected before and after the healing touch intervention or control video. The bio-field intervention led to significant decreases in self-reported levels of stress, and stress related biological markers (blood pressure, cortisol, and IL6). Decreases in blood pressure were (statistically) greater for the treatment than for the control but not for the other markers (cortisol and IL6). The higher the level of stress before the intervention, as measured by one of the stress measures, the greater the decrease in stress regardless of treatment group. This study lends support to Principle 5 of the Complex Systems Science and supports bio-field interventions for the treatment of anxiety in university students.",

      "title": "Stress Relief and Permeability Enhancement with Hydraulic Fracturing in Overlying Key Strata of Deep and Soft Coal Seams.",
      "abstract": "The technical problems of high in situ stress, high gas pressure, high gas content, and low coal seam permeability are widespread in deep soft coal seam excavation, which leads to frequent occurrences of dynamic phenomena, such as coal cannons and blowout holes. Based on the high-pressure hydraulic fracturing technology and process, this study puts forward a new technology of gas drainage in deep and soft coal seams by fracturing the overlying key strata to cut off the stress transmission path among coal and rock strata. According to the theories of key layer and masonry beams, the distribution locations of the main and subkey strata are determined, and based on uniaxial compression and Brazilian splitting experiments, the mechanical parameters of key stratum were tested. Combined with the results of numerical simulation and field test, initial pressure and fracturing radius of hydraulic fracturing technology for overlying key strata were determined, the stress relief effect and permeability variation law of coal seam after hydraulic fracturing in the main and subkey strata were analyzed, and then technical schemes for simultaneous fracturing of the key layer were designed. Field application results showed that the stress concentration phenomenon in soft coal seam excavation had been alleviated, and the stress relief effect of coal seam and the permeability were increased obviously. The volume and concentration of gas drainage were increased by 10 and 11%, respectively, the gas amount by 1.22 times; the frequency of dynamic phenomena such as coal cannons decreased by 95%, the gas concentration in return air flow by 20% during mining processes. This paper provided an innovative technical idea and process for gas control in deep and soft coal seam excavation, which could effectively solve the common and difficult problems about frequent occurrences of excessive gas concentration and dynamic phenomena.",

      "title": "Stress-induced overeating behaviors explained from a (transitory) relief-learning perspective.",
      "abstract": "People use various behaviors to cope with stressful events. These behaviors are mostly adaptive, as they allow a successful release of stress without impacting other aspects of life: How nice is it to have a break with a few spoons of that favorite ice cream during a hectic working day? However, when excessive consumption of high-sugar/salt ultra-processed food becomes the gateway to find relief from stress, eating loses this adaptive function and may escalate to binge eating, lead to obesity, and other medical conditions linked to overweight. Several etiological models attempt to explain stress-induced eating and excessive overeating behaviors characterizing these clinical conditions. The popular Emotional Eating Theory proposes that stress-related (over-)eating, a major predictor of obesity and diagnosed binge eating disorders, develops based on negative reinforcement learning since food consumption regulates the negative affective state associated with stressful circumstances. Differently, the prominent Incentive Sensitization Theory explains overeating, binge eating disorders (including bulimia), and obesity in terms of excessive amplification of reward 'wanting', which is thought to emerge from overexposure to obesogenic (food)cues. The several studies oriented by these theories have paved the way to better understand stress-related (over-)eating and its clinical excesses. However, a deep mechanistic understanding of how and why stress-induced (over-)eating can escalate till clinical forms of overeating remain elusive. A well-funded connection of the mechanisms proposed by the Emotional Eating Theory and the Incentive Sensitization Theory might address this etiological open question. To avoid erroneous arguments, it is however essential to first address the internal theoretical and methodological shortcomings of each theory and connected studies. These shortcomings stem from conceptual fallacies and poorly implemented designs, which might partially explain the 'high variability and low replicability' problem of empirical findings. Next, the formulation of a new integrative model could provide fresh insight into the deep learning and biological mechanisms of this escalation. A successful formalization of this model could then create the much-needed impact in clinical and preventive research since excessive overeating is a behavior hard to change once established. In this opinion paper, I propose to apply recent insights we gathered on the role of relief from the field of safety learning to stress (over-)eating. I will present a new relief-based model that, as a starting point, has the potential to connect the Emotional Eating Theory with the Incentive Sensitization Theory, setting the base for more integrative science.",

      "abstract": "The 21st century presents many challenges to mankind, including climate change, fast growing human population, and serious concerns over food security. Wheat is a leading cereal crop that largely fulfills the global food needs. Low temperature stress accompanied by nutrient-starved soils is badly disrupting the source-sink relationship of wheat, thus causing an acute decline in final yield and deteriorating the grain quality. This review paper aimed to understand how low temperature stress affects wheat source-sink organs (i.e., leaves, roots, and spikes) and how phosphorus application reliefs in alleviating its harmful consequences. Also, we discussed mitigation strategies to enhance wheat capacity to adapt to varying temperature extremes and made rational recommendations based on modern agronomic and breeding approaches. Therefore, this study is likely to establish a solid foundation for improving the tolerance to low temperature stress and to improve its phosphorus utilization efficiency in wheat.",

      "abstract": "The emotional stress of English translation practitioners is an important research content of psychological organization counseling behavior. Based on the theory of role cognition, this paper adopts the perspective of emotional stress experience, integrates the construction theory and the self-determination theory, and builds an emotional stress relief mechanism for English translation practitioners. On the basis of sorting out psychological capital, emotional commitment, and behavioral variables of organizational practitioners, the article summarizes the concept, dimension, measurement, and causes and effects of variables and solves the problem of quantitative analysis of emotional stress. In the simulation process, the role cognitive variables and local cognitive variables are extracted separately using the dual-branch mitigation mechanism structure to enhance the diversity of the extracted cognitive variables; in the local branch, a loss function of emotional stress overlapping partial penalty mechanism is constructed. This mechanism is used to select a suitable destination sink node for the sensor nodes around the sink node with heavy load to transmit data and effectively relieve the data collection pressure of the original sink node. The experimental results show that by using role cognitive variables and local cognitive variables in the training of classification loss and triple loss, respectively, the mitigation mechanism can mine subtle and significant cognitive variables from the local area and finally integrate role cognitive cognition. The accuracy rate of obtaining 297 questionnaires reached 91.4%, which effectively promoted the mechanism research of emotional stress on the behavior of English translation practitioners.",

In contrast, supernatural fears do not involve direct experience but seem to be related to sensory or cognitive biases in the interpretation of stimuli as well as culturally driven cognitions and beliefs. In this multidisciplinary synthesis and collaborative review, we claim that supernatural beliefs are \"super natural.\" That is, they occur spontaneously and are easy to acquire, possibly because such beliefs rest on intuitive concepts such as mind-body dualism and animism, and may inspire fear in believers as well as non-believers. As suggested by psychological and neuroscientific evidence, they tap into an evolutionarily prepared fear of potential impending dangers or unknown objects and have their roots in \"prepared fears\" as well as \"cognitively prepared beliefs,\" making fear of supernatural agents a fruitful research avenue for social, anthropological, and psychological inquires.",

Studies that evaluated and manipulated the temporal properties of resting-state microstates and utilized questionnaires, task-initiated thoughts, specific tasks before or between EEG session(s), pharmacological interventions, neuromodulation approaches, or localized sources of the extracted microstates were selected. Fifty studies that met the inclusion criteria were included. A new microstate labeling system has been proposed for a comprehensible comparison between the studies, where four classical microstates are referred to as A-D, and the others are labeled by the frequency of their appearance. Microstate A was associated with both auditory and visual processing and links to subjects' arousal/arousability. Microstate B showed associations with visual processing related to self, self-visualization, and autobiographical memory. Microstate C was related to processing personally significant information, self-reflection, and self-referential internal mentation rather than autonomic information processing. In contrast, microstate E was related to processing interoceptive and emotional information and to the salience network. Microstate D was associated with executive functioning. Microstate F is suggested to be a part of the Default Mode Network and plays a role in personally significant information processing, mental simulations, and theory of mind. Microstate G is potentially linked to the somatosensory network.",

In parallel, machine learning research has found that experience replay can lead to substantial performance improvements in artificial agents. Together, these lines of research suggest that replay has a variety of computational benefits for decision-making and learning. Here, we provide an overview of putative computational functions of replay as suggested by machine learning and neuroscientific research. We show that replay can lead to faster learning, less forgetting, reorganization or augmentation of experiences, and support planning and generalization. In addition, we highlight the benefits of reactivating abstracted internal representations rather than veridical memories, and discuss how replay could provide a mechanism to build internal representations that improve learning and decision-making.",

Recognizing the growing significance of this analytical method, the authors aim to provide the microstate research community with a comprehensive discussion on methodological standards, unresolved questions, and the functional relevance of EEG microstates. In August 2022, a conference was hosted in Bern, Switzerland, which brought together many researchers from 19 countries. During the conference, researchers gave scientific presentations and engaged in roundtable discussions aiming at establishing steps toward standardizing EEG microstate analysis methods. Encouraged by the conference's success, a special issue was launched in Brain Topography to compile the current state-of-the-art in EEG microstate research, encompassing methodological advancements, experimental findings, and clinical applications. The call for submissions for the special issue garnered 48 contributions from researchers worldwide, spanning reviews, meta-analyses, tutorials, and experimental studies. Following a rigorous peer-review process, 33 papers were accepted whose findings we will comprehensively discuss in this Editorial.",

      "title": "Decoding cognition from spontaneous neural activity.",
      "abstract": "In human neuroscience, studies of cognition are rarely grounded in non-task-evoked, 'spontaneous' neural activity. Indeed, studies of spontaneous activity tend to focus predominantly on intrinsic neural patterns (for example, resting-state networks). Taking a 'representation-rich' approach bridges the gap between cognition and resting-state communities: this approach relies on decoding task-related representations from spontaneous neural activity, allowing quantification of the representational content and rich dynamics of such activity. For example, if we know the neural representation of an episodic memory, we can decode its subsequent replay during rest. We argue that such an approach advances cognitive research beyond a focus on immediate task demand and provides insight into the functional relevance of the intrinsic neural pattern (for example, the default mode network). This in turn enables a greater integration between human and animal neuroscience, facilitating experimental testing of theoretical accounts of intrinsic activity, and opening new avenues of research in psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov blankets, one of the central constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently, we propose to distinguish between \"Pearl blankets\" to refer to the original epistemic use of Markov blankets and \"Friston blankets\" to refer to the new metaphysical construct. Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would do well in differentiating between two different research programmes: \"inference with a model\" and \"inference within a model.\" Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.",

      "abstract": "Humans acquire energy from the environment for survival. A central question for nutritional sciences is how much energy is required to sustain cellular work while maintaining an adequate body mass. Because human energy balance is not exempt from thermodynamic principles, the energy requirement can be approached from the energy expenditure. Conceptual and technological advances have allowed understanding of the physiological determinants of energy expenditure. Body mass, sex, and age are the main factors determining energy expenditure. These factors constitute the basis for predictive equations for resting (REE) and total (TEE) energy expenditure in healthy adults. These equations yield predictions that differ up to ~400 kcal/d for REE and ~550 kcal/d for TEE. Identifying additional factors accounting for such variability and the most valid equations appears relevant. This review used novel approaches based on mathematical modeling of REE and analyses of the data from which REE predictive equations were generated. As for TEE, R",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric and metabolic disorders are highly comorbid and the relationship between these disorders is bidirectional. The mechanisms underlying the association between psychiatric and metabolic disorders are presently unclear, which warrants investigation into the dynamics of the interplay between metabolism, substrate utilization, and energy expenditure in psychiatric populations, and how these constructs compare to those in healthy controls. Indirect calorimetry (IC) methods are a reliable, minimally invasive means for assessing metabolic rate and substrate utilization in humans. This review synthesizes the extant literature on the use of IC on resting metabolism in psychiatric populations to investigate the interaction between psychiatric and metabolic functioning. Consistently, resting energy expenditures and/or substrate utilization values were significantly different between psychiatric and healthy populations in the studies contained in this review. Furthermore, resting energy expenditure values were systematically overestimated when derived from predictive equations, compared to when measured by IC, in psychiatric populations. High heterogeneity between study populations (e.g., differing diagnoses and drug regimens) and methodologies (e.g., differing posture, time of day, and fasting status at measurement) impeded the synthesis of results. Standardized IC protocols would benefit this line of research by enabling meta-analyses, revealing trends within and between different psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the physiological demands and motion analysis of a simulated fencing competition. Eighteen fencers each completed 5 'poule' (5 touches) and 'direct elimination (DE)' (15 touches) fights. Expired gases were measured during 1 poule and DE fight. Heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and movement data were recorded throughout all fights. Motion analysis was undertaken using the software LINCE PLUS. Differences between poule and DE fights were determined by either a paired t-test or a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. HR and RPE were significantly greater during DE compared to poule (170 ±10 vs 163 ±13 beats·min-1; P<0.05). A greater distance was covered during a DE fight compared to a poule fight (459.9 ± 117.7 m vs 162.6 ± 74.2 m; P<0.05). The average values of [Formula: see text] were 42.5 ±5.6 ml·kg-1·min-1 in men and 34.4 ±3.2 ml·kg-1·min-1 in women. Work-to-rest ratios reduced during the DE fights along with a lower average speed and increased max speed (11.7 ± 2.8 km∙h-1 vs 9.6 ± 1.6 km∙h-1; P<0.05). In conclusion, there is an increased physiological demand during a DE fight accompanied by a reduction in average speed and decreased work-to-rest ratio.",

      "abstract": "The brain is continuously bombarded by external stimuli, which are processed in different input systems. The intrinsic features of these sensory input systems remain yet unclear. Investigating topography and dynamics of input systems is the goal of our study in order to better understand the intrinsic features that shape their neural processing. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging dataset, we measured neural topography and dynamics of the input systems during rest and task states. Neural dynamics were probed by scale-free activity, measured with the power-law exponent (PLE), as well as by order/disorder as measured with sample entropy (SampEn). Our main findings during both rest and task states are: 1) differences in neural dynamics (PLE, SampEn) between regions within each of the three sensory input systems 2) differences in topography and dynamics among the three input systems; 3) PLE and SampEn correlate and, as demonstrated in simulation, show non-linear relationship in the critical range of PLE; 4) scale-free activity during rest mediates the transition of SampEn from rest to task as probed in a mediation model. We conclude that the sensory input systems are characterized by their intrinsic topographic and dynamic organization which, through scale-free activity, modulates their input processing.",

      "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have been shown to provide improved performance over traditional heuristic algorithms for the detection of arrhythmias from ambulatory ECG recordings. However, these DCNNs have primarily been trained and tested on device-specific databases with standardized electrode positions and uniform sampling frequencies. This work explores the possibility of training a DCNN for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection on a database of single‑lead ECG rhythm strips extracted from resting 12‑lead ECGs. We then test the performance of the DCNN on recordings from ambulatory ECG devices with different recording leads and sampling frequencies. We developed an extensive proprietary resting 12‑lead ECG dataset of 549,211 patients. This dataset was randomly split into a training set of 494,289 patients and a testing set of the remaining 54,922 patients. We trained a 34-layer convolutional DCNN to detect AF and other arrhythmias on this dataset. The DCNN was then validated on two Physionet databases commonly used to benchmark automated ECG algorithms (1) MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and (2) MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Validation was performed following the EC57 guidelines, with performance assessed by gross episode and duration sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Finally, validation was also performed on a selection of rhythm strips from an ambulatory ECG patch that a committee of board-certified cardiologists annotated. On MIT-BIH, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 100% and 84% PPV in detecting episodes of AF. and 100% sensitivity and 94% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On AFDB, The DCNN achieved a sensitivity of 94% and PPV of 98% in detecting episodes of AF, and 98% sensitivity and 100% PPV in quantifying AF episode duration. On the patch database, the DCNN demonstrated performance that was closely comparable to that of a cardiologist. The results indicate that DCNN models can learn features that generalize between resting 12‑lead and ambulatory ECG recordings, allowing DCNNs to be device agnostic for detecting arrhythmias from single‑lead ECG recordings and enabling a range of clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown potential for identifying early-stage biomarkers of neurocognitive dysfunction associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). A large body of evidence shows that, compared to healthy controls (HC), AD is associated with power increases in lower EEG frequencies (delta and theta) and decreases in higher frequencies (alpha and beta), together with slowing of the peak alpha frequency. However, the pathophysiological processes underlying these changes remain unclear. For instance, recent studies have shown that apparent shifts in EEG power from high to low frequencies can be driven either by frequency specific periodic power changes or rather by non-oscillatory (aperiodic) changes in the underlying 1/f slope of the power spectrum. Hence, to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying the EEG alterations associated with AD, it is necessary to account for both periodic and aperiodic characteristics of the EEG signal. Across two independent datasets, we examined whether resting-state EEG changes linked to AD reflect true oscillatory (periodic) changes, changes in the aperiodic (non-oscillatory) signal, or a combination of both. We found strong evidence that the alterations are purely periodic in nature, with decreases in oscillatory power at alpha and beta frequencies (AD < HC) leading to lower (alpha + beta) / (delta + theta) power ratios in AD. Aperiodic EEG features did not differ between AD and HC. By replicating the findings in two cohorts, we provide robust evidence for purely oscillatory pathophysiology in AD and against aperiodic EEG changes. We therefore clarify the alterations underlying the neural dynamics in AD and emphasize the robustness of oscillatory AD signatures, which may further be used as potential prognostic or interventional targets in future clinical investigations.",

      "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity has generated great hopes as a potential brain biomarker for improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in psychiatry. This neuroimaging protocol can routinely be performed by patients and does not depend on the specificities of a task. Thus, it seems ideal for big data approaches that require aggregating data across multiple studies and sites. However, technical variability, diverging data analysis approaches, and differences in data acquisition protocols introduce heterogeneity to the aggregated data. Besides these technical aspects, a prior task that changes the psychological state of participants might also contribute to heterogeneity. In healthy participants, studies have shown that behavioral tasks can influence resting-state measures, but such effects have not yet been reported in clinical populations. Here, we fill this knowledge gap by comparing resting-state functional connectivity before and after clinically relevant tasks in two clinical conditions, namely substance use disorders and phobias. The tasks consisted of viewing craving-inducing and spider anxiety provoking pictures that are frequently used in cue-reactivity studies and exposure therapy. We found distinct pre- vs post-task resting-state connectivity differences in each group, as well as decreased thalamo-cortical and increased intra-thalamic connectivity which might be associated with decreased vigilance in both groups. Our results confirm that resting-state measures can be strongly influenced by prior emotion-inducing tasks that need to be taken into account when pooling resting-state scans for clinical biomarker detection. This demands that resting-state datasets should include a complete description of the experimental design, especially when a task preceded data collection.",

      "abstract": "Can motor expertise be robustly predicted by the organization of frequency-specific oscillatory brain networks? To answer this question, we recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in expert Tango dancers and naïves while viewing and judging the correctness of Tango-specific movements and during resting. We calculated task-related and resting-state connectivity at different frequency-bands capturing task performance (delta [δ], 1.5-4 Hz), error monitoring (theta [θ], 4-8 Hz), and sensorimotor experience (mu [μ], 8-13 Hz), and derived topographical features using graph analysis. These features, together with canonical expertise measures (i.e., performance in action discrimination, time spent dancing Tango), were fed into a data-driven computational learning analysis to test whether behavioral and brain signatures robustly classified individuals depending on their expertise level. Unsurprisingly, behavioral measures showed optimal classification (100%) between dancers and naïves. When considering brain models, the task-based classification performed well (~73%), with maximal discrimination afforded by theta-band connectivity, a hallmark signature of error processing. Interestingly, mu connectivity during rest outperformed (100%) the task-based approach, matching the optimal classification of behavioral measures and thus emerging as a potential trait-like marker of sensorimotor network tuning by intense training. Overall, our findings underscore the power of fine-tuned oscillatory network signatures for capturing expertise-related differences and their potential value in the neuroprognosis of learning outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Stress is ubiquitous in everyday life and hazardous for mental and physical health. To prevent or ameliorate stress-related disease, relaxation exercises aim to counteract stress by inducing short-lasting states of relaxation on a regular basis. Critically, current assessments capture the mid- and long-term consequences of relaxation, however, cannot measure its short-term effects on an individual's momentary psychological state. To address this problem, we developed the Relaxation State Questionnaire (RSQ). We assessed the psychometric quality of the questionnaire by investigating its item properties, reliability, and validity in an online study with 92 participants. Construct validity was examined through correlations with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ; Fliege in https://doi.org/10.23668/PSYCHARCHIVES.2889 , 2009). An exploratory factor analysis revealed four factors capturing the momentary state of muscle tension, sleepiness, cardiovascular activity, and general relaxation. In a second online study with 99 participants, we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis. Results revealed high item loadings (0.70-0.91), excellent reliability (α = 0.86) and excellent fit indices, and a good construct validity of the RSQ. These findings establish the RSQ as a tool to measure momentary states of relaxation. As such, the RSQ opens up research of the immediate subjective effects and the effectiveness of relaxation exercises.",

      "abstract": "Padel, an increasingly popular sport, presents some associated cardiovascular risks, which can be prevented by heart rate variability (HRV) monitoring. However, there is no study worldwide that characterizes HRV during padel games. Therefore, this study aims to monitor HRV responses and characterize them using linear and non-linear metrics at three timepoints: at baseline, during a game, and during recovery. Twenty-seven amateur participants had their HRV monitored before, during, and after a 90 min padel game. We extracted time, frequency, and non-linear measures with MATLAB for baseline, rest period, and at three periods of 5 min during the game. The differences in measures were assessed through an ANOVA. The autonomic modulation was affected by the padel match in amateur players. In this regard, the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSsd), Poincaré plot (perpendicular standard deviation (SD1) and horizontal standard deviation (SD2)), sample entropy (SampEn), low frequencies (LF), and very low frequencies (VLF) were significantly reduced during the game, whereas alpha-2, high frequencies (HF), and the ratio between low and high frequencies (LF/HF) increased during the game. Furthermore, an abrupt change was found in the autonomic modulation between game and recovery assessments, which suggests the need to rethink the practices of cool-down protocols. The multiple timepoints analyzed during this study allow us to investigate the evolution of different HRV measures in the time, frequency, and non-linear domains, clarifying the interpretation of the variables, especially the less-investigated ones such as the non-linear measures.",

      "abstract": "Sleep promotes adaptation of behavior and underlying neural plasticity in comparison to active wakefulness. However, the contribution of its two main characteristics, sleep-specific brain activity and reduced stimulus interference, remains unclear. We tested healthy humans on a texture discrimination task, a proxy for neural plasticity in primary visual cortex, in the morning and retested them in the afternoon after a period of daytime sleep, passive waking with maximally reduced interference, or active waking. Sleep restored performance in direct comparison to both passive and active waking, in which deterioration of performance across repeated within-day testing has been linked to synaptic saturation in the primary visual cortex. No difference between passive and active waking was observed. Control experiments indicated that deterioration across wakefulness was retinotopically specific to the trained visual field and not due to unspecific performance differences. The restorative effect of sleep correlated with time spent in NREM sleep and with electroencephalographic slow wave energy, which is thought to reflect renormalization of synaptic strength. The results indicate that sleep is more than a state of reduced stimulus interference, but that sleep-specific brain activity restores performance by actively refining cortical plasticity.",

      "abstract": "The brain's \"default mode network\" (DMN) enables flexible switching between internally and externally focused cognition. Precisely how this modulation occurs is not well understood, although it may involve key subcortical mechanisms, including hypothesized influences from the basal forebrain (BF) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD). Here, we used ultra-high field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the involvement of the BF and MD across states of task-induced DMN activity modulation. Specifically, we mapped DMN activity suppression (\"deactivation\") when participants transitioned between rest and externally focused task performance, as well as DMN activity engagement (\"activation\") when task performance was internally (i.e., self) focused. Consistent with recent rodent studies, the BF showed overall activity suppression with DMN cortical regions when comparing the rest to external task conditions. Further analyses, including dynamic causal modeling, confirmed that the BF drove changes in DMN cortical activity during these rest-to-task transitions. The MD, by comparison, was specifically engaged during internally focused cognition and demonstrated a broad excitatory influence on DMN cortical activation. These results provide the first direct evidence in humans of distinct BF and thalamic circuit influences on the control of DMN function and suggest novel mechanistic avenues for ongoing translational research.",

      "abstract": "The objective was to exploit the raw data output from a scalable home cage (type IIL IVC) monitoring (HCM) system (DVC®), to characterize pattern of undisrupted rest and physical activity (PA) of C57BL/6J mice. The system's tracking algorithm show that mice in isolation spend 67% of the time in bouts of long rest (≥40s). Sixteen percent is physical activity (PA), split between local movements (6%) and locomotion (10%). Decomposition revealed that a day contains ˜7100 discrete bouts of short and long rest, local and locomotor movements. Mice travel ˜330m per day, mainly during the dark hours, while travelling speed is similar through the light-dark cycle. Locomotor bouts are usually <0.2m and <1% are >1m. Tracking revealed also fits of abnormal behaviour. The starting positions of the bouts showed no preference for the rear over the front of the cage floor, while there was a strong bias for the peripheral (75%) over the central floor area. The composition of bouts has a characteristic circadian pattern, however, intrusive husbandry routines increased bout fragmentation by ˜40%. Extracting electrode activations density (EAD) from the raw data yielded results close to those obtained with the tracking algorithm, with 81% of time in rest (<1 EAD s-1) and 19% in PA. Periods ≥40 s of file when no movement occurs and there is no EAD may correspond to periods of sleep (˜59% of file time). We confirm that EAD correlates closely with movement distance (rs>0.95) and the data agreed in ˜97% of the file time. Thus, albeit EAD being less informative it may serve as a proxy for PA and rest, enabling monitoring group housed mice. The data show that increasing density from one female to two males, and further to three male or female mice had the same effect size on EAD (˜2). In contrast, the EAD deviated significantly from this stepwise increase with 4 mice per cage, suggesting a crowdedness stress inducing sex specific adaptations. We conclude that informative metrics on rest and PA can be automatically extracted from the raw data flow in near-real time (< 1 hrs). As discussed, these metrics relay useful longitudinal information to those that use or care for the animals.",

      "abstract": "While functional neuroimaging studies typically focus on a particular paradigm to investigate network connectivity, the human brain appears to possess an intrinsic \"trait\" architecture that is independent of any given paradigm. We have previously proposed the use of \"cross-paradigm connectivity (CPC)\" to quantify shared connectivity patterns across multiple paradigms and have demonstrated the utility of such measures in clinical studies. Here, using generalizability theory and connectome fingerprinting, we examined the reliability, stability, and individual identifiability of CPC in a group of highly-sampled healthy traveling subjects who received fMRI scans with a battery of five paradigms across multiple sites and days. Compared with single-paradigm connectivity matrices, the CPC matrices showed higher reliability in connectivity diversity, lower reliability in connectivity strength, higher stability, and higher individual identification accuracy. All of these assessments increased as a function of number of paradigms included in the CPC analysis. In comparisons involving different paradigm combinations and different brain atlases, we observed significantly higher reliability, stability, and identifiability for CPC matrices constructed from task-only data (versus those from both task and rest data), and higher identifiability but lower stability for CPC matrices constructed from the Power atlas (versus those from the AAL atlas). Moreover, we showed that multi-paradigm CPC matrices likely reflect the brain's \"trait\" structure that cannot be fully achieved from single-paradigm data, even with multiple runs. The present results provide evidence for the feasibility and utility of CPC in the study of functional \"trait\" networks and offer some methodological implications for future CPC studies.",

      "abstract": "This study examined sex differences in the EEG of adults diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) according to DSM-5 criteria. Sixteen females and 16 males with AD/HD, and age- and sex-matched control groups, had an eyes-closed resting EEG recorded from 19 electrode sites. EEGs were Fast Fourier transformed and estimates for total power, absolute and relative power in the delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma bands, and the theta/beta ratio, were analysed across nine cortical regions. Males with AD/HD, compared with male controls, had globally reduced absolute beta, globally elevated relative theta, and a larger theta/beta ratio. In contrast, no global effects emerged between females with and without AD/HD. Significant group interactions indicated that globally elevated relative theta and elevated frontal-midline theta/beta ratio noted in males with AD/HD differed significantly from results in females. There are statistically significant EEG differences in relative theta and the theta/beta ratio between males and females with and without AD/HD. These results indicate that AD/HD affects the EEG activity of males and females differently. This study helps confirm the need for further independent examination of AD/HD within female populations.",

      "abstract": "In medical image segmentation tasks, deep learning-based models usually require densely and precisely annotated datasets to train, which are time-consuming and expensive to prepare. One possible solution is to train with the mixed-supervised dataset, where only a part of data is densely annotated with segmentation map and the rest is annotated with some weak form, such as bounding box. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture called Mixed-Supervised Dual-Network (MSDN), which consists of two separate networks for the segmentation and detection tasks respectively, and a series of connection modules between the layers of the two networks. These connection modules are used to extract and transfer useful information from the detection task to help the segmentation task. We exploit a variant of a recently designed technique called 'Squeeze and Excitation' in the connection module to boost the information transfer between the two tasks. Compared with existing model with shared backbone and multiple branches, our model has flexible and trainable feature sharing fashion and thus is more effective and stable. We conduct experiments on 4 medical image segmentation datasets, and experiment results show that the proposed MSDN model outperforms multiple baselines.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have reported a significant increase in stress experienced by students owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, interest in stress management using nature-derived substances has increased. However, studies examining the effects of olfactory stimulation by fir are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological and psychological effects of inhaling fir essential oil. Additionally, differences between male and female participants were compared. Twenty-six university students (16 female and 10 male students; mean age, 21.5 ± 1.9 years) participated in this study. Fir essential oil was used for olfactory stimulation, with normal room air as the control. The odor was administered for 3 min. Heart rate variability and heart rate were used as indicators of autonomic nervous system activity. The Profile of Mood States and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used as psychological indicators. The ln(Low Frequency/High Frequency) ratio, which is an indicator of sympathetic nervous activity reflecting a stressful or aroused state during stimulation with fir essential oil, was significantly lower than during the control condition. Assessment of psychological indicators showed that the positive mood of \"vigor\" improved significantly and negative moods of \"tension-anxiety\", \"depression\", \"anger-hostility\", \"fatigue\" and anxiety levels reduced significantly after inhaling fir essential oil compared to the control condition. This study showed that inhalation of fir essential oil has physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects, with differences in results depending on the sex of the participants.",

However, to date no quantitative synthesis of the literature linking parenting and child ANS physiology has been conducted. To address this gap, we conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature identified 103 studies (n = 13,044 participants) with available effect sizes describing the association between parenting and either parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) or sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in children. The overall analysis revealed non-significant associations between parenting and child ANS physiology on average. However, moderation analyses revealed a positive association between more positive parenting and higher resting PNS activity that was stronger when a study was experimental rather than correlational, and when the sample included children with a clinical condition. In conclusion, well-controlled experimental studies show that positive parenting is associated with the development of higher resting PNS activity, an effect that may be stronger among children who are at elevated developmental risk.",

However, there is no consistent conclusion demonstrating that music can contribute to stress recovery, primarily due to limitations in stress measurement, and inconsistent methodology within existing studies. Our study explores whether relaxing music, especially when self-selected, outperforms non-music acoustic, and silence conditions, fostering both subjective and biological stress recovery.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions), and few studies have assessed the whole-brain functional connectivity architecture of OCD with electroencephalogram (EEG) during different resting states. Graph theory and network-based statistics (NBS) were employed to examine the neural synchronization and the whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) based on the phase-locking value (PLV) of OCD patients and healthy controls (HCs) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) states. Compared with HCs, OCD patients exhibited not only decreased global synchronization in terms of phase synchrony but also aberrant global topological properties (decreased average shortest path lengths and normalized shortest path lengths together with increased global efficiencies and normalized clustering coefficients) together with inhibited intra-hemispheric and interhemispheric FCs during rest, which suggested an imbalance between functional integration and segregation of brain networks for OCD patients. Meanwhile, OCD patients had increased global efficiencies and normalized clustering coefficients, but decreased average clustering coefficients and normalized shortest path lengths together with significantly decreased FCs in the alpha band from EC to EO states, which suggested a dynamic switch between highly integrated (EC state) and highly specialized (EO state) modes of information processing. Moreover, the decreased FCs of OCD patients showed obvious hemispheric asymmetry within or between groups during EC and EO states, which might serve as a potential biomarker to classify OCD patients from HCs.",

In the current study, we examined differences between Believers and Non-Believers with regard to fundamental neural resting networks using EEG microstate analysis. Results demonstrated that Non-Believers show increased contribution from a resting-state network associated with deliberative or analytic processing (Microstate D), and Believers show increased contribution from a network associated with intuitive or automatic processing (Microstate C). Further, analysis of resting-state network communication suggested that Non-Believers may process visual information in a more deliberative or top-down manner, and Believers may process visual information in a more intuitive or bottom-up manner. These results support dual process explanations of individual differences in religious belief and add to the representation of non-belief as more than merely a lack of belief.",

      "abstract": "Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technique based on analyzing spontaneous, low frequency fluctuations in the activity of brain areas by measuring by their MRI signal to investigate the functional architecture of the brain during rest. The use of resting state fMRI opens up possibilities for assessing brain functional relationships in both normal conditions and in different CNS pathologies in order to clarify the disturbed mechanisms of brain functioning and develop approaches for therapeutic non-invasive neuromodulation. Understanding the acquisition of data, the features of their preprocessing and analysis is very important for clinicians who use resting state fMRI in their studies, since it is neurologists, psychiatrists, and neurosurgeons who set research tasks and are the final consumers of the results. The article details the methodological features of obtaining and analyzing resting state fMRI data, the advantages and disadvantages of the method. The article is intended for a wide range of specialists using this method in their work or planning to include it in their research.",

      "abstract": "Detecting structures within the continuous diving behavior of marine animals is challenging, and no universal framework is available. We captured such diverse structures using chaos theory. By applying time-delay embedding to exceptionally long dive records (83 d) from the narwhal, we reconstructed the state-space portrait. Using measures of chaos, we detected a diurnal pattern and its seasonal modulation, classified data, and found how sea-ice appearance shifts time budgets. There is more near-surface rest but deeper dives at solar noon, and more intense diving during twilight and at night but to shallower depths (likely following squid); sea-ice appearance reduces rest. The introduced geometrical approach is simple to implement and potentially helpful for mapping and labeling long-term behavioral data, identifying differences between individual animals and species, and detecting perturbations.",

      "abstract": "Recent focus on the consequences of early life adversity (ELA) in neurobiological research led to a variety of findings suggesting alterations in several physiological systems, such as the cardiovascular system. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we focused on the relationship between early life maltreatment (ELM), one form of ELA, and resting vagal activity indexed by resting-state heart rate variability (HRV). A systematic search of the literature yielded 1'264 hits, of which 32 studies reporting data for group comparisons or correlations were included. By quantitative synthesis of existing studies using random-effect models, we found no evidence for a relationship between ELM exposure and resting vagal activity in principal. Conducting meta-regression analyses, however, we found the relationship between ELM and resting vagal activity to significantly vary as a function of both age and the presence of psychopathology. In light of the current multitude of vastly unclear pathways linking ELM to the onset of disease, we emphasize the need for further research and outline several aspects to consider in future studies.",

      "abstract": "The large-scale electrophysiological events known as electroencephalographic microstates provide an important window into the intrinsic activity of whole-brain neuronal networks. The spontaneous activity of coordinated brain networks, including the ongoing temporal dynamics expressed by microstates, are thought to reflect individuals' neurocognitive functioning, and predict development, disease progression, and psychological differences among varied populations. A comprehensive understanding of human brain function therefore requires characterizing typical and atypical patterns in the temporal dynamics of microstates. But population-level estimates of normative microstate temporal dynamics are still unknown. To address this gap, I conducted a systematic search of the literature and accompanying meta-analysis of the average dynamics of microstates obtained from studies investigating spontaneous brain activity in individuals during periods of eyes-closed and eyes-open rest. Meta-analyses provided estimates of the average temporal dynamics of microstates across 93 studies totaling 6583 unique individual participants drawn from diverse populations. Results quantified the expected range of plausible estimates of average microstate dynamics across study samples, as well as characterized heterogeneity resulting from sampling variability and systematic differences in development, clinical diagnoses, or other study methodological factors. Specifically, microstate dynamics significantly differed for samples with specific developmental differences or clinical diagnoses, relative to healthy, typically developing samples. This research supports the notion that microstates and their dynamics reflect functionally relevant properties of large-scale brain networks, encoding typical and atypical neurocognitive functioning.",

However, there is a need for clear guidelines on the understanding of the different actigraphic parameters. The present study aims to propose a conceptual and theoretical framework for known actigraphic-derived parameters, which is able to describe the alternation between rest and wake phases during the nocturnal sleep, explaining their main characteristics and interrelations that can be replicated in future studies. Forty Sport Sciences students at the University of Milan (20 males; mean age ± SD, 22 ± 3 y) completed the validated Italian version of Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and wore an actigraph (Motion Watch 8®, Cambridge Neurotechnology, Cambridge, UK) for seven days. A framework was developed to depict the interactions between the actigraphic parameters and how they objectively describe sleep, according to which the parameters are organized into three different functional blocks related to different aspects of sleep. Correlations analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among the primary actigraphic parameters within and across the functional blocks. The proposed framework is a purely theoretical construct that provides a simple interpretation of known actigraphic parameters guiding researchers and practitioners in the use of these parameters either for research or clinical purposes.",

      "abstract": "The importance of integrated movement behaviours (MB, i.e., physical activity [PA], sedentary behaviour, and sleep) and their interdependence for health has been recently discussed in the literature. The proposition that the amount of time spent in any one of these behaviours may impact the amount of time spent in another is supported by the ActivityStat hypothesis. The aim of this review is to (1) to assess whether individuals with liver disease display MB and/or energy (i.e., total energy expenditure [EE], basal EE, resting EE, and activity EE) compensation throughout the day and/or days; and (2) to examine whether a prescribed PA intervention triggers compensatory responses. Documents were included if they focused on people living with liver disease; analysed MB and/or EE components; were data-based; and were published in English. Fifteen documents were included in the final synthesis. The one finding that addressed research question 1 showed no compensatory response. As for research question 2, most of the findings suggest no compensation effects in response to a PA intervention. There is insufficient evidence to support the ActivityStat hypothesis in people living with liver disease. Further research should be conducted to test this hypothesis using standardized methodological procedures.",

      "abstract": "Among the strategies to avoid COVID-19 disease that affects the world population it is keeping away from contagion through confinement and social distancing, which can cause in children and adolescents a change in the psychosocial environment with a high prevalence of psychological and psychiatric disorders, such as stress, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, risk of suicide and eating disorders. During confinement, were made school closures, shutdowns of recreational and sports spaces, cancellation of outdoor activities, which can have consequences in social habits, sleep, modifications in the eating pattern that entails alterations in anthropometric variables, neurophysiological alterations with behaviors that affect mental health, in addition to the frustration of not executing plans, fear, boredom and the uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic could lead to further stress. Social distancing favors a reduction in interaction, is related to anxiety, stress and depression, in addition to the concern of infecting the family. These scenarios can generate stress for parents, domestic violence and uncontrolled use of the internet. Children and adolescents are vulnerable populations that adapt to the environment in crisis. The objective of this work was to review the influence of confinement and social distancing on stress, anxiety and depression in children and adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Nursing students are reported to have moderate to high test anxiety, leading to reduced academic performance, poor self-esteem, and failure to complete the program and practice nursing. This review aims to examine the interventions for test anxiety reduction in nursing students. Following the PRISMA guidelines, peer-reviewed experimental studies published in English between 2016 and 2021 from four databases, EBSCOhost, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus, were systematically searched. The findings were presented in tabular and narrative form. Among the 722 studies retrieved, 14 selected studies were critically appraised, guided by the Joanna Briggs checklist for Randomized Controlled Trials and the checklist for Quasi-Experimental Studies, resulting in 11 studies for inclusion in the systematic review. Test anxiety was assessed by different scales. Aromatherapy hand massage, aromatherapy using a diffuser in combination with music therapy, confidence training for test relaxation, coping program, music therapy, emotional freedom technique, animal-assisted intervention, and guided imagery were all found to be effective in reducing test anxiety. In conclusion, while numerous interventions to reduce test anxiety in nursing students were found to be effective, the quality of the studies investigating these interventions was varied with generally small sample sizes and limited follow-up. Future research should be conducted, and the same interventions should be carried out using a larger sample size to strengthen the body of evidence.",

      "abstract": "Engaging in yoga may mitigate stress and anxiety in individuals while potentially enhancing one's capacity to manage distractions. Our research aimed to explore the relation between these two outcomes: Can an eight-week yoga program foster distraction suppression, thereby reducing stress and discomfort? To answer this question, we used Hatha Yoga, the most commonly practiced form of yoga. We tested if the intervention improved participants' ability to suppress distractions and selectively decrease self-reported stress and stress reactivity. In Addition, we investigated whether such an intervention would increase participants' mindfulness. Our study included 98 healthy yoga novices between 18 and 40 years who were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a waitlist condition, with each participant completing pre- and post-intervention assessments, including questionnaires, as well as electrophysiological and behavioral measures. After eight weeks of yoga practice, significant reductions in self-reported stress and stress reactivity levels, as well as increased mindfulness, were observed among those participating in the intervention relative to those in the waitlist control group. There were, however, no significant changes in state or trait anxiety due to the intervention. Changes in stress measures could not be explained by changes in participants' ability to suppress distractors, which was not affected by the intervention. Overall, our findings suggest that regular participation in Hatha Yoga can improve mental health outcomes without impacting cognitive functioning directly related to distractor suppression.

      "title": "The Effect of Exercise Training on Anxiety Symptoms in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.",
      "abstract": "Elevated anxiety symptoms and disorders affect ~10% to 20% of US children and adolescents annually, which contributes to developmental disturbances in social, emotional, and cognitive domains. Although preliminary evidence (primarily in adults) suggests that exercise may be a promising therapeutic approach for lowering anxiety among children and adolescents, sufficient meta-analytic evidence is lacking. The aim of this study was to estimate the population effect of exercise training on anxiety levels in children and adolescents, and to test the extent to which effects vary based on features of the exercise stimulus (e.g., exercise intensity, mode, duration, frequency) and participant characteristics (e.g., age, sex, clinical vs. nonclinical samples). Included studies were: (1) peer-reviewed publications, (2) published in English, (3) included youth participants < 20 years of age, (4) measured the change in anxiety symptoms in a no-treatment control and exercise-only treatment group, or a combined treatment group from which an independent effect of exercise could be estimated, and (5) reported results as mean and standard deviation, standard error, or 95% confidence intervals (CI) from which an effect size could be calculated. A standardized mean difference effect size (ES; Hedges' d) was calculated by subtracting the mean change in the control condition from the mean change in the exercise condition and dividing the difference by the pooled standard deviation of baseline values. Random effects models were used to aggregate a mean ES and 95% confidence interval using a three-level meta-analysis model structure to adjust for between-study variance and the correlation between effects nested within studies. Random effects meta-regression was used to explore potential sources of variability. In total, 39 effects derived from 22 studies published between 1982 and 2023 showed that exercise training significantly reduced anxiety symptoms by a moderate-sized magnitude (ES = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.06; p < 0.001). The majority of effects (k = 28, 71.79%) were larger than zero and ranged from -0.26 to 2.82. Moderator analyses indicated that mean effect size significantly varied based on exercise training intensity (p = 0.032); stronger magnitude reductions in anxiety symptoms were found for moderate- and high-intensity training (k = 28, ES = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.45 to 1.31) compared to low-intensity training (k = 11, ES = 0.21, 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.45). No other moderators significantly influenced the relationship between exercise and anxiety. Exercise training resulted in a moderate-sized, potentially clinically meaningful, mean reduction in anxiety symptoms among children and adolescents, with larger effects found for moderate- and high-intensities, supporting exercise training as a promising therapeutic approach to lower anxiety symptoms among children and adolescents. Future research is needed to address methodological limitations present in the included studies, including measured and reported details about the exercise stimulus, the use of assessments with stronger evidence to support their reliability and validity, and testing of plausible mechanisms for anxiety-reducing effects after exercise training.

      "abstract": "This study sought to systematically review the full body of research on test anxiety in primary (elementary) school children aged 5-12 years. A comprehensive electronic and manual literature search identified 76 studies (85 independent samples; N = 53,617 children) that satisfied inclusion criteria. Inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analysis showed that test anxiety related negatively to academic achievement in Mathematics (r = 0.21) and Literacy (r = -0.20), academic self-concept (r = -0.41), and self-efficacy (r = -0.39), and related positively to general anxiety (r = 0.62), social anxiety (r = 0.57), and depression (r = 0.45). Test anxiety was higher among girls than boys (d = 0.21) and in Asian samples compared to European and North American samples. There was some evidence of publication bias and heterogeneity across meta-analyses. Random effects meta-regression models further showed that the association between test anxiety and mathematics achievement was stronger among older children compared to younger children, and that gender differences in test anxiety scores were more prevalent in North American samples compared to Asian samples. Intervention studies targeting anxiety reduction have been successful in reducing test anxiety and improving test anxiety-related outcomes. Overall, findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that test anxiety varies in magnitude across populations and relates to multiple educational and psychosocial outcomes. We recommend further experimental studies that target the reduction of test anxiety among primary school children.",

      "title": "Ketamine treatment for refractory anxiety: A systematic review.",
      "abstract": "There is a growing interest in the psychiatric properties of the dissociative anaesthetic ketamine, as single doses have been shown to have fast-acting mood-enhancing and anxiolytic effects, which persist for up to a week after the main psychoactive symptoms have diminished. Therefore, ketamine poses potential beneficial effects in patients with refractory anxiety disorders, where other conventional anxiolytics have been ineffective. Ketamine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, which underlies its induction of pain relief and anaesthesia. However, the role of NMDA receptors in anxiety reduction is still relatively unknown. To fill this paucity in the literature, this systematic review assesses the evidence that ketamine significantly reduces refractory anxiety and discusses to what extent this may be mediated by NMDA receptor antagonism and other receptors. We highlight the temporary nature of the anxiolytic effects and discuss the high discrepancy among the study designs regarding many fundamental factors such as administration routes, complementary treatments and other treatments.",

      "title": "Effect Of Caffeine and Adrenaline on Memory and Anxiety in Male Wistar Rats.",
      "abstract": "The present study was designed to investigate the effects of caffeine and adrenaline administration on memory and anxiety in male rats. Rats weighing about 140-200g were used for the study. They were divided into three groups (4 animals per group). Study groups 1; a,b,c,d were healthy rats administered normal saline, 5,10 and 15mg/kg bw caffeine intraperitoneally (i.p.), respectively for 6 weeks. Study groups 2; a,b,c,d administered normal saline, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.31mg/kg bw adrenaline (i.p.), respectively for 6 weeks. Study groups 3; a,b,c,d administered normal saline, 5mg/kg caffeine (i.p.) + 0.1mg/kg adrenaline (i.p.), 10mg/kg Caffeine (i.p.) + 0.2mg/kg Adrenaline (i.p.) and 15mg/kg Caffeine (i.p.) + 0.3mg/kg Adrenaline (i.p.) respectively for 6 weeks. The result showed no significant difference in spatial memory across all animals in study groups 1: b,c,d when compared to control (a). Study groups 2: (b, c) showed increase in spatial memory when compared to control (a). 2(d) showed a significant (p<0.05) decrease. Study groups 3: b, c, d showed no significant difference in spatial memory when compared to control (a). Study groups 1: b, c showed significant (p<0.05) reduction in duration for the short and long term memory test when compared to control. Study groups 2 showed reduction in duration for both the long and short term memory test when compared to control Study groups 3 no significant (p<0.05) difference in short and long term memory test across all animals in the group. It was also observed that adrenaline enhanced short and long term memory and only high dose of adrenaline distorted spatial memory. Study groups 1; (b,c) showed significant (p<0.05) increase in the number of entries to the open arm of the elevated plus maze when compared to control (a). Study groups 2; (b), showed significant (p<0.05) increase in the frequencies of entries to the closed arm of the elevated plus maze when compared to control (a). Study groups 2; (d), showed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in the frequency of entries to the open and closed arm when compared to control (a). The study revealed that co- administration of caffeine and adrenaline led to elevation of mood, increased activity and reduction of anxiety in Wistar rats. In addition, it was observed that only high dose of adrenaline increased anxiety. It was also observed that caffeine and adrenaline enhanced short and long term memory and only high dose of adrenaline distorted spatial memory.",

The authors evaluated engagement in and effects of a coach-enhanced digital cognitive-behavioral intervention (dCBI; RxWell) targeting emotional distress in this age group. The dCBI app was prescribed to 506 adolescents and young adults at 35 pediatric practices; 278 enrolled in the app, of whom 58% engaged and 63% messaged their coach. Patients completed monthly General Anxiety Disorder-7 and eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire assessments, and a subset completed qualitative interviews. The dCBI app was associated with a significant reduction in anxiety and depression at 1 and 3 months. A dCBI is feasible as part of routine pediatric care and associated with reduced emotional distress.",

This study also examined associations between parental distress and parent-reported child outcomes of treatment. Two hundred ninety-nine children and adolescents, ages 6-19, who were patients in the intensive treatment program and their caregivers participated in this intervention-based study. Parents reported significant reductions in their own distress from admission to discharge, and greater reductions in parent-reported distress predicted greater reductions in parents' reports of their children's anxiety symptoms and the degree of child functional impairment. Higher levels of parent-reported parent mental health symptoms at children's admission and at discharge were associated with poorer levels of functioning in children at discharge. Parents' mental health symptoms may play a critical role in children and adolescents' treatment outcomes and therefore may need to be a separate treatment target.",

      "abstract": "While the vast majority of research involving creatine supplementation has focused on skeletal muscle, there is a small body of accumulating research that has focused on creatine and the brain. Preliminary studies indicate that creatine supplementation (and guanidinoacetic acid; GAA) has the ability to increase brain creatine content in humans. Furthermore, creatine has shown some promise for attenuating symptoms of concussion, mild traumatic brain injury and depression but its effect on neurodegenerative diseases appears to be lacking. The purpose of this narrative review is to summarize the current body of research pertaining to creatine supplementation on total creatine and phophorylcreatine (PCr) content, explore GAA as an alternative or adjunct to creatine supplementation on brain creatine uptake, assess the impact of creatine on cognition with a focus on sleep deprivation, discuss the effects of creatine supplementation on a variety of neurological and mental health conditions, and outline recent advances on creatine supplementation as a neuroprotective supplement following traumatic brain injury or concussion.",

      "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence from observational and intervention studies in nutritional psychiatry regarding the importance of diet for mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Here, we synthesise this evidence, including findings from large meta-analyses showing cross-sectional and prospective associations between diet quality and mental health, even following adjustment for relevant confounding factors. Potential mechanistic pathways underpinning these associations include those of the gut-brain axis, demonstrated mostly in animal models. Dietary fibre is an important component of healthy diet and may be relevant for common mental disorders, with some studies showing a dose-dependent relationship between fibre intake and risk of depression. The potential contribution of nutraceuticals is also discussed, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and psychobiotics. We consider the relevance of special diets such as the ketogenic diet and food sensitivities in the management of severe mental illness (e.g., anorexia nervosa) and brain disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Given the relatively early nature of research in nutritional psychiatry, there remain a number of challenges to its translation into clinical practice. These span individual, clinical, and societal domains. We conclude with a discussion of micro- and macroeconomic factors which may be considered in the successful application of nutritional psychiatry research to improve public health.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental disorders. There is mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the development and progression of mental disorders such as depression; however, less is known about the role of nutrition in anxiety disorders. This scoping review sought to systematically map the existing literature on anxiety disorders and nutrition in order to identify associations between dietary factors and anxiety symptoms or disorder prevalence as well as identify gaps and opportunities for further research. The review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews. Due to the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) with artificial intelligence features was used. Studies reporting an association between a dietary constituent and anxiety symptoms or disorders were counted and presented in figures. A total of 55,914 unique results were identified. After a full-text review, 1541 articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis revealed an association between less anxiety and more fruits and vegetables, omega-3 fatty acids, \"healthy\" dietary patterns, caloric restriction, breakfast consumption, ketogenic diet, broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation, zinc, magnesium and selenium, probiotics, and a range of phytochemicals. Analysis revealed an association between higher levels of anxiety and high-fat diet, inadequate tryptophan and dietary protein, high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, and \"unhealthy\" dietary patterns. Results are limited by a large percentage of animal and observational studies. Only 10% of intervention studies involved participants with anxiety disorders, limiting the applicability of the findings. High quality intervention studies involving participants with anxiety disorders are warranted.",

      "abstract": "The role of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant response in training adaptations and sports performance has been a large issue investigated in the last few years. The present review aims to analyze the role of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant response in sports performance. For this aim, the production of reactive oxygen species in physical activities, the effect of reactive oxygen species on sports performance, the relationship between reactive oxygen species and training adaptations, inflammation, and the microbiota, the effect of antioxidants on recovery and sports performance, and strategies to use antioxidants supplementations will be discussed. Finally, practical applications derived from this information are discussed. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during physical activity greatly influences sports performance. This review concludes that ROS play a critical role in the processes of training adaptation induced by resistance training through a reduction in inflammatory mediators and oxidative stress, as well as appropriate molecular signaling. Additionally, it has been established that micronutrients play an important role in counteracting free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species, which cause oxidative stress, and the effects of antioxidants on recovery, sports performance, and strategies for using antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, resveratrol, coenzyme Q10, selenium, and curcumin to enhance physical and mental well-being.",

We conducted a systematic review of 24 observational studies (n = 2817), and 19 interventional trials (n = 1119). We assessed alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa abundance changes in patients with MDD relative to HC, as well as the effect of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical or subclinical depression. We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks. The GMB profiles of patients with MDD differ significantly from HC, but further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and over longer follow-up before these therapies are implemented into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Recent estimates for the global brain health supplement category, i.e. nootropic market size, will grow to nearly $5.8 billion by 2023. Overall, nearly one-quarter (23%) of adults currently take a supplement to maintain or improve brain health or delay and reverse dementia. Not surprisingly, the use of such supplements increases with age - more than one-third of the oldest generation (ages 74 and older) takes a supplement for brain health. This widespread use is being driven by a strong desire both in the younger and older generations to enhance cognitive performance and achieve healthy aging. The most prevalent botanicals currently dominating the nootropic marketplace include Gingko biloba, American ginseng, and Bacopa monnieri. However, other botanicals that affect stress, focus, attention, and sleep have also been procured by dietary supplement companies developing products for improving both, short and long-term brain health. This review focuses on efficacy data for neuroactive botanicals targeted at improving cognitive function, stress reduction, memory, mood, attention, concentration, focus, and alertness, including Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, Holy basil, American ginseng, Gotu kola, Lemon balm, Common and Spanish sages and spearmint. Botanicals are discussed in terms of available clinical efficacy data and current safety profiles. Data gaps are highlighted for both efficacy and safety to bring attention to unmet needs and future research.",

      "abstract": "A healthy diet shapes a healthy mind. Diet quality has a strong association with brain health. Diet influences the onset and consequences of neurological diseases, and dietary factors may influence mental health at individual and population level. The link between unhealthy diet, impaired cognitive function and neurodegenerative diseases indicates that adopting a healthy diet would ultimately afford prevention and management of neurological diseases and brain aging. Neurodegenerative diseases are of multifactorial origin and result in progressive loss of neuronal function in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment and motoneuron disorders. The so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) with its healthy ingredients rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immune, neuroprotective, antidepressant, antistress and senolytic activity plays an essential role in the prevention and management of neurological diseases and inhibits cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The MedDiet also modulates the gut-brain axis by promoting a diversity of gut microbiota. In view of the importance of diet in neurological diseases management, this review focuses on the dietary components, natural compounds and medicinal plants that have proven beneficial in neurological diseases and for brain health. Among them, polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins and several ayurvedic herbs have promising beneficial effects.",

Numerous in vivo evidence has provided support for the brain health potential of spirulina, highlighting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective mechanisms. Preliminary clinical studies have also suggested that spirulina can help to reduce mental fatigue, protect the vascular wall of brain vessels from endothelial damage and regulate internal pressure, thus contributing to the prevention and/or mitigating of cerebrovascular conditions. Furthermore, the use of spirulina in malnourished children appears to ameliorate motor, language, and cognitive skills, suggesting a reinforcing role in developmental mechanisms. Evidence of the central effect of spirulina on appetite regulation has also been shown. This review aims to understand the applicative potential of spirulina microalgae in the prevention and mitigation of brain disorders, highlighting the nutritional value of this \"superfood\", and providing the current knowledge on relevant molecular mechanisms in the brain associated with its dietary introduction.",

      "title": "The Influence of Vitamin D Intake and Status on Mental Health in Children: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "A potential role of vitamin D in some components of mental health is currently suggested, but the analyses are conducted mainly for adults, while for young individuals mental health is especially important, due to its lifelong effects. The aim of the study was to analyze the association between vitamin D intake or status and mental health in children within a systematic review of literature, including both intervention and observational studies. The literature search was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines and it covered peer-reviewed studies included in databases of PubMed and Web of Science until October 2019. The studies presenting either vitamin D intake, or vitamin D status in human subjects were allowed (excluding subjects with intellectual disabilities, eating disorders and neurological disorders), while for mental health the various methods of assessment and wide scope of factors were included. The bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779). A number of 7613 studies after duplicate removing were extracted by two independent researchers, followed by screening and assessment for eligibility, conducted by two independent researchers in two steps (based on title and abstract). Afterwards, the full texts were obtained and after reviewing, a number of 24 studies were included. The synthetic description of the results was prepared, structured around exposure (vitamin D supplementation/status) and outcome (components of mental health). The included studies were conducted either in groups of healthy individuals, or individuals with mental health problems, and they assessed following issues: behavior problems, violence behaviors, anxiety, depressive symptoms/depression, aggressive disorder, psychotic features, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, suicidal incident, as well as general patterns, as follows: mental health, level of distress, quality of life, well-being, mood, sleep patterns. The vast majority of assessed studies, including the most prominent ones (based on the NOS score) supported potential positive influence of vitamin D on mental health in children. As a limitation of the analysis, it should be indicated that studies conducted so far presented various studied groups, outcomes and psychological measures, so more studies are necessary to facilitate comparisons and deepen the observations. Nevertheless, vitamin D intake within a properly balanced diet or as a supplementation, except for a safe sun exposure, should be indicated as an element supporting mental health in children, so it should be recommended to meet the required 25(OH)cholecalciferol blood level in order to prevent or alleviate mental health problems.",

      "abstract": "Objective: to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effects of high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplementation on physical, mental, and energy outcomes in healthy and 'at-risk' (suboptimal nutritional status/subclinical symptoms at baseline) adult populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for relevant randomized controlled trials until January 2020. Results: overall, 136 publications were identified. In the seven randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies considered eligible for inclusion, supplementation in healthy populations predominantly showed improvements in perceived stress, physical stamina, concentration, and general mental health, and significant reductions in anxiety and improvements in self-reported vigour. However, not all of these outcomes were significant, and statistical correction for multiple outcomes was not commonly employed. Studies investigating brain mapping following supplementation indicated increased functional activity in brain regions related to processing of attention, executive control, and working memory during cognitive tasks. Conclusions: while there is certainly a need for further studies on the neurocognitive and physical benefits of micronutrient supplementation, this review provides generally supportive evidence for the benefits of a high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplement in healthy and at-risk populations in terms of physical, mental, and energy outcomes.",

Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. ",

      "abstract": "Magnesium (Mg) is a vital element for various metabolic and physiological functions in the human body, including its crucial role in skeletal muscle health. Hypomagnesaemia is frequently reported in many muscle diseases, and it also seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle impairment in patients with neuromuscular diseases. The aim of this scoping review is to analyze the role of Mg in skeletal muscle, particularly its biological effects on muscle tissue in neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) in terms of biological effects and clinical implications. This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. From the 305 studies identified, 20 studies were included: 4 preclinical and 16 clinical studies. Preclinical research has demonstrated that Mg plays a critical role in modulating pathways affecting skeletal muscle homeostasis and oxidative stress in muscles. Clinical studies have shown that Mg supplementation can improve muscle mass, respiratory muscle strength, and exercise recovery and reduce muscle soreness and inflammation in athletes and patients with various conditions. Despite the significant role of Mg in muscle health, there is a lack of research on Mg supplementation in NMDs. Given the potential similarities in pathogenic mechanisms between NMDs and Mg deficiency, further studies on the effects of Mg supplementation in NMDs are warranted. Overall, maintaining optimal Mg levels through dietary intake or supplementation may have important implications for improving muscle health and function, particularly in conditions associated with muscle weakness and atrophy.",

      "abstract": "One of the most challenging and controversial issues in microbiome research is related to gut microbial metabolism and neuropsychological disorders. Psychobiotics affect human behavior and central nervous system processes via the gut-brain axis, involving neuronal, immune, and metabolic pathways. They have therapeutic potential in the treatment of several neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, anxiety, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, anorexia nervosa, and multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between psychobiotics and the abovementioned diseases need further exploration. This review focuses on the relationship between gut microbiota and its impact on neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, examining the potential of psychobiotics as a preventive and therapeutic approach, summarising recent research on the gut-brain axis and the potential beneficial effects of psychobiotics, highlighting the need for further research and investigation in this area.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "The human body, particularly the brain, requires energy, stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Energy metabolism during cellular respiration is dependent on the presence of multiple micronutrients, which act as essential components, coenzymes, or precursors at every stage. An adequate supply of multiple micronutrients is vital for efficient energy production. However, micronutrient intakes below the recommended dietary allowance are common, even in industrialized countries. Intakes of vitamins A, D, E, folate, iron, zinc, and selenium are suboptimal across all age groups. Suboptimal micronutrient levels have been shown to contribute to low energy levels, physical and mental fatigue, and impaired cognitive performance and wellbeing - symptoms frequently present in the general population. When supplemented in combination in well-conducted trials, multiple micronutrients ± coenzyme Q10 reduced oxidative stress in chronic fatigue syndrome; in healthy people they increased cerebral blood-flow hemodynamic response, energy expenditure, and fat oxidation; reduced mental and physical fatigue; improved the speed and accuracy of cognitive function during demanding tasks; and reduced stress. The results from these clinical trials suggest that even in industrialized countries, where adults might be assumed to have a healthy, balanced diet, there is a rationale to supplement with multiple micronutrients, including coenzyme Q10, to improve nutritional status, support energy metabolism, and improve subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review ansd meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of L-theanine, a non-proteinogenic amino acid found in tea, on sleep outcomes. Literature searches were conducted in five electronic databases (APA PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, Web of Science), and one register (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) from inception until September 2024. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of L-theanine supplementation on sleep quality in humans of all ages and health status were included. Nineteen articles (N = 897 participants) were selected and 18 included in the meta-analysis. L-theanine was shown to significantly improve subjective sleep onset latency (SMD = 0.15, 95 % CI [0.01, 0.29], p = 0.04; n = 10 studies), subjective daytime dysfunction (SMD = 0.33, 95 % CI [0.16, 0.49], p < 0.001; n = 9 studies), and overall subjective sleep quality score (SMD = 0.43, 95 % CI [0.04, 0.83], p = 0.03; n = 12 studies). The findings indicate the potential use of L-theanine in the management of sleep disturbances; however, the lack of studies on \"pure\" L-theanine warrants further investigation. Future studies are needed to determine the adequate dose and duration of L-theanine supplementation for improving and maintaining sleep quality in healthy and clinical populations.",

      "abstract": "Part I of this systematic review summarized the state-of-the-art of pediatric psychopharmacology for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a severe and lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder. The purpose of this Part II follow-up article is to provide a systematic overview of the experimental psychopharmacology of ASD. To this aim, we have first identified in the Clinicaltrials.gov website all the 157 pharmacological and nutraceutical compounds which have been experimentally tested in children and adolescents with ASD using the randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) design. After excluding 24 drugs already presented in Part I, a systematic review spanning each of the remaining 133 compounds was registered on Prospero (ID: CRD42023476555), performed on PubMed (August 8, 2024), and completed with EBSCO, PsycINFO (psychology and psychiatry literature) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, yielding a total of 115 published RCTs, including 57 trials for 23 pharmacological compounds and 48 trials for 17 nutraceuticals/supplements. Melatonin and oxytocin were not included, because recent systematic reviews have been already published for both these compounds. RCTs of drugs with the strongest foundation in preclinical research, namely arbaclofen, balovaptan and bumetanide have all failed to reach their primary end-points, although efforts to target specific patient subgroups do warrant further investigation. For the vast majority of compounds, including cannabidiol, vasopressin, and probiotics, insufficient evidence of efficacy and safety is available. However, a small subset of compounds, including N-acetylcysteine, folinic acid, l-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, sulforaphane, and metformin may already be considered, with due caution, for clinical use, because there is promising evidence of efficacy and a high safety profile. For several other compounds, such as secretin, efficacy can be confidently excluded, and/or the data discourage undertaking new RCTs. Part I and Part II summarize \"drug-based\" information, which will be ultimately merged to provide clinicians with a \"symptom-based\" consensus statement in a conclusive Part III, with the overarching aim to foster evidence-based clinical practices and to organize new strategies for future clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Despite the public health benefits of cycling in the general population, mental health issues may be evident in high-performance and elite-level competitive domains. With prominent riders disclosing their experiences with psychiatric symptoms, distinctive socioenvironmental factors could exacerbate psychopathological vulnerabilities. This suggests a need for greater mental health awareness amongst stakeholders, supplemented by actions from international and national federations and regulators. To synthesise relevant observations about psychiatric concerns in high-performance and elite-level cycling, we conducted a keyword search of articles in APA PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus based on specified exclusion criteria. Thirteen papers were identified that examined mental health issues in high-performance and/or elite-level cycling per classifications from the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. A large proportion of articles illustrated eating disorder symptomatology, but others discussed attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorder, depression, sleep wake disorders, and substance use disorder. Existing literature underlines important considerations for all stakeholders within the cycling community around mental health initiatives and care provisions, which are currently lacking across the sport. Such programmes could incorporate consensus statements, psychiatric screening, psychoeducation, stigma-reducing policies, and athlete advocacy. These can help mitigate socioenvironmental risk factors and prioritise athlete wellbeing over performance-centred motivations.",

      "abstract": "There has been much discussion over the past few years about the potential benefits of supplementing traditional approaches to the assessment of mental health problems, which are based largely on reports of symptoms and observed behaviors, with more objective measures. Task-based neurocognitive measures are one of the more obvious approaches that can be considered. Potential tasks include those indexing executive functioning, through its key components: working memory, inhibitory control, set-shifting and planning, and those assessing more basic cognitive functions such as non-executive aspects of memory, processing speed, and response variability. Importantly, it is now becoming clear that the relationships between psychopathology and neurocognitive functioning are more complex than once thought. Neurocognitive deficits in executive and more basic cognitive functioning are seen across a broad range of psychiatric disorders, and although there may be subtle differences in cognitive profile across different disorders, most data support a more transdiagnostic approach.",

      "abstract": "Keeping the immune system healthy forms an effective way to fight infections. Past experience has shown that, in addition to effective interventions including vaccination, drug therapy, and non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI), dietary nutrition and mental health are also key factors in maintaining immune system health and combating emerging and sudden outbreaks of infections. As the main dietary nutrients, vitamins are active regulators of the immune response and exert a critical impact on the immunity of the human body. Vitamin deficiency causes increased levels of inflammation and decreased immunity, which usually starts in the oral tissues. Appropriate vitamin supplementation can help the body optimize immune function, enhance oral immunity, and reduce the negative impact of pathogen infection on the human body, which makes it a feasible, effective, and universally applicable anti-infection solution. This review focuses on the immunomodulatory effects of vitamin A, B, C, D, and E and proposes that an omics-based new systemic approach will lead to a breakthrough of the limitations in traditional single-factor single-pathway research and provide the direction for the basic and applied research of vitamin immune regulation and anti-infection in all aspects.",

With this aim in mind, we organized a workshop on mental health as part of the main program of the Winter meeting of the Primate Society of Great Britain in December 2021. The workshop was very well received. Here, we review the main issues raised in the workshop, and supplement them with our own observations, reflections, and reading. The information we gathered during the workshop reveals clear hazards to mental health and suggests that we must collectively acknowledge and better manage both the hazards themselves and our ability to cope with them if we are to avert disaster. We call on institutions and learned societies to lead in seeking solutions for the benefit of primatologists and primatology.",

      "abstract": "Psychobiotics include a novel class of probiotic microorganisms that convey benefit upon the host's mental health via the dynamic microbiota-gut-brain crosstalk. Research is bolstering the concept that gut bacteria are involved in the transmission of information between the gut and the brain, engaging neural, immune, and endocrine pathways. Factors such as diet, stress and aging can shape the microbiota composition in a process that may also influence the onset and development of mental diseases. This review aims to provide an outline of the link between the microbiota and brain function focusing on preclinical and clinical evidence of the potential application of psychobiotics in the context of the cognitive process and performance. The occurrence of metabolic precursors of neurotransmitters in foods that can be converted by the gut microbiota and play a role in the gut-brain axis is discussed. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which communication occurs is still at its infancy; however clinical studies have shown that dietary interventions based on psychobiotics might be a novel nutritional approach targeting gut microbiota for managing cognitive performance and preventing memory decline across the lifespan.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this analysis was to assess the associations between pandemic-related stressors and feeling more anxious/depressed, among women with a live birth. We analyzed data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) COVID-19 maternal experiences supplement, implemented in 29 U.S. jurisdictions from October 2020-June 2021, among women with a live birth during April-December 2020. We examined stressors by type (economic, housing, childcare, food insecurity, partner, COVID-19 illness) and score (number of stressor types experienced [none, 1-2, 3-4, or 5-6]). Outcomes were feeling 1) more anxious and 2) more depressed than usual due to the pandemic. We calculated adjusted prevalence ratios estimating associations between stressors and outcomes. Among 12,525 respondents, half reported feeling more anxious and 28% more depressed than usual. The prevalence of stressor types was 50% economic, 41% childcare, 18% partner, 17% food insecurity, 12% housing, and 10% COVID-19 illness. Respondents who experienced partner stressors (anxious aPR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.73-1.90; depressed aPR: 3.01, 95% CI: 2.78-3.25) and food insecurity (anxious aPR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.71-1.88; depressed aPR: 2.32, 95% CI: 2.13-2.53) had the largest associations with feeling more anxious and depressed than usual. As stressor scores increased, so did the aPRs for feeling more anxious and more depressed due to the pandemic. COVID-19 stressors, not COVID-19 illness, were found to be significantly associated with feeling more anxious and depressed. Pregnant and postpartum women might benefit from access to supports and services to address pandemic-related stressors/social-determinants and feelings of anxiety and depression.",

      "abstract": "The health catastrophe originated by COVID-19 pandemic construed profound impact on a global scale. However, a plethora of research studies corroborated convincing evidence conferring severity of infection of SARS-CoV-2 with the aberrant gut microbiome that strongly speculated its importance for development of novel therapeutic modalities. The intense exploration of probiotics has been envisaged to promote the healthy growth of the host, and restore intestinal microecological balance through various metabolic and physiological processes. The demystifying effect of probiotics cannot be defied, but there exists a strong skepticism related to their safety and efficacy. Therefore, molecular signature of probiotics termed as \"postbiotics\" are of paramount importance and there is continuous surge of utilizing postbiotics for enhancing health benefits, but little is explicit about their antiviral effects. Therefore, it is worth considering their prospective role in post-COVID regime that pave the way for exploring the pastoral vistas of postbiotics. Based on previous research investigations, the present article advocates prospective role of postbiotics in alleviating the health burden of viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2. The article also posits current challenges and proposes a futuristic model describing the concept of \"precision postbiotics\" for effective therapeutic and preventive interventions that can be used for management of this deadly disease.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D has a promising role in multiple sclerosis (MS) management, and it has been found to be beneficial for patients' mental health, which is reduced in MS patients. The aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the influence of vitamin D supplementation on mental health in MS patients. The systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779) and it was conducted on the basis of the PRISMA guidelines. The search procedure was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science databases and it included studies published up until September 2021. Six studies were included in the systematic review. The risk of bias was analyzed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Within the included studies, there were two studies randomized against placebo and four other prospective studies. The studies presented vitamin D interventions randomized against placebo or not randomized, while supplementation was applied for various durations-from 4 weeks to 12 months, or the studies compared patients who applied vitamin D supplementation and those who did not apply it and verified the effect of the supplementation after a number of years. The mental health outcomes that were assessed included quality of life, depression/depressive symptoms, and fatigue as an additional element. The majority of studies supported the positive influence of vitamin D on the mental health of MS patients, including the study characterized as having the highest quality (randomized against placebo with the highest NOS score). All the studies that assessed the quality of life indicated the positive influence of vitamin D while the studies that did not find a positive influence of vitamin D were conducted for depression/depressive symptoms. In spite of the fact that only a small number of studies have been conducted so far, and only two studies were randomized against a placebo, some conclusions may be formulated. The systematic review allowed us to conclude that there may be a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation in MS patients, which was stated in all of the studies analyzing quality of life, as well as in one study analyzing depressive symptoms. Considering that vitamin D deficiency is common in MS patients, and the potential positive influence of supplementation on the quality of life, supplementation should be applied at least in doses that cover the recommended intake.",

One explanation is that social media use does not affect self-esteem for the majority of users, while small minorities experience either positive or negative effects, as evidenced by recent research calculating person-specific within-person effects. This suggests that the true relationship between social media use and self-esteem is person-specific and based on individual susceptibilities and uses. In recognition of these advancements, we review recent empirical studies considering differential uses and moderating variables in the social media-self-esteem relationship, and conclude by discussing opportunities for future social media effects research.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence represents a vulnerable phase of life for psychological health. The practice of physical activity (PA) appears to have a positive influence on adolescents, increasing self-esteem and producing a more positive body image. A systematic review of published articles over the past 10 years until June 2022 was conducted according to the PRISMA statement employing the electronic databases MEDLINE and Web of Science (639 records) to summarize the literature on the relationship between body image dissatisfaction (BID) and assessed by figural scales and practice of structured and unstructured PA in adolescents (10-18 years), taking into account BMI and/or weight status. All articles were independently reviewed using inclusion/exclusion criteria, retrieved data, and assessed quality with the adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. The main finding of interest that emerged from most of the 28 included studies is the negative association between BID and PA during adolescence: as PA increases, BID decreases. However, this updated systematic review also identified some flaws in the existing literature, highlighting the need for high-quality adolescent research using validated figural scales and objective PA assessments. In conclusion, the reviewed studies showed that PA involvement can be efficacious in protecting from body image perception concerns and enhancing body satisfaction. Future interventions should promote structured and unstructured PA during adolescence to improve self-esteem and body image.",

      "abstract": "Theorists have long assumed that people's self-esteem and social relationships influence each other. However, the empirical evidence has been inconsistent, creating substantial uncertainty about whether relationships are in fact an influential factor in self-esteem development and vice versa. This meta-analysis synthesizes the available longitudinal data on the prospective effect of social relationships on self-esteem (48 samples including 46,231 participants) and the prospective effect of self-esteem on social relationships (35 samples including 21,995 participants). All effects controlled for prior levels of the outcomes. Results showed that relationships and self-esteem reciprocally predict each other over time with similar effect sizes (β = .08 in both directions). Moderator analyses suggested that the effects held across sample characteristics such as mean age, gender, ethnicity, and time lag between assessments, except for the self-esteem effect on relationships, which was moderated by type of relationship partner (stronger for general relationships than for specific partners) and relationship reporter (stronger for self-reported than for informant-reported relationship characteristics). The findings support assumptions of classic and contemporary theories on the influence of social relationships on self-esteem and on the consequences of self-esteem for the relationship domain. In sum, the findings suggest that the link between people's social relationships and their level of self-esteem is truly reciprocal in all developmental stages across the life span, reflecting a positive feedback loop between the constructs.

      "title": "Enhancing Self-Esteem and Body Image of Breast Cancer Women through Interventions: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Breast Cancer (BC) is the most common neoplasm in women worldwide, considered a global public health problem. Among BC women, some of the most common psychological symptoms in the adaptation to the disease are reduction in self-esteem and distorted body image (BI). Although there are numerous studies with the goal of promoting different psychological variables, BI and self-esteem are often separately observed despite their relationship and their importance in the process of the illness. Moreover, there have been no reviews that have synthesized the findings related to interventions aimed at enhancing both self-esteem and BI in BC women. Therefore, the objective of this review was to identify and examine the implemented interventions aimed at boosting both variables in this population. For this purpose, a systematic review was implemented following the PRISMA statement. A thorough search was performed on the following databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsychInfo, PsychArticles, and Scopus. Among 287 records, only eight articles met the eligibility criteria. Interventions were grouped into three types according to their characteristics: Group therapies, Physical activity therapies, and Cosmetic and beauty treatments. The levels of effectiveness of the different interventions varied between them, and within each, in their impact on self-esteem and BI. More interventions focused on developing BI and self-esteem in this population are needed due to their ability to predict psychological functioning and quality of life of women with breast cancer.",

      "title": "Is high self-esteem beneficial? Revisiting a classic question.",
      "abstract": "Debates about the benefits of self-esteem have persisted for decades, both in the scientific literature and in the popular press. Although many researchers and lay people have argued that high self-esteem helps individuals adapt to and succeed in a variety of life domains, there is widespread skepticism about this claim. The present article takes a new look at the voluminous body of research (including several meta-analyses) examining the consequences of self-esteem for several important life domains: relationships, school, work, mental health, physical health, and antisocial behavior. Overall, the findings suggest that self-esteem is beneficial in all these domains, and that these benefits hold across age, gender, and race/ethnicity, and controlling for prior levels of the predicted outcomes and potential third variable confounds. The meta-analytic estimates of self-esteem effects (which average .10 across domains) are comparable in size to estimates for other hypothesized causal factors such as self-efficacy, positive emotionality, attachment security, and growth mindset, and larger than some generally accepted pharmaceutical interventions. Discussion focuses on several issues that are critical for evaluating the findings, including the strength of the evidence for making causal inferences, the magnitude of the effects, the importance of distinguishing between self-esteem and narcissism, and the generalizability of the results. In summary, the present findings support theoretical conceptions of self-esteem as an adaptive trait that has wide-ranging influences on healthy adjustment and adaptation, and suggest that interventions aimed at boosting self-esteem might, if properly designed and implemented, benefit individuals and society as a whole.

Some theories predict that increased earnings lead to higher self-esteem, others that increased self-esteem leads to higher earnings, and still others that there should be no within-person associations between these variables. We tested these theories in 4-year longitudinal data from more than 4,000 adult participants from a Dutch representative sample. Results indicated significant between-person associations between income and self-esteem, consistent with prior research. Within-person effects suggested that increases in self-esteem are a function of previous increases in income more than the other way around. These links held when analyses controlled for employment status, and they generalized across gender, age, and educational background. Overall, the findings provide evidence for theories that consider self-esteem as both a source and a consequence of personal earnings.",

Based on this taxonomy, we highlight consumption domains and recent consumer trends that impact self-esteem. Moreover, we suggest priorities for further research.",

Furthermore, compassionate goals also predict increased attachment security, trust, and self-esteem over time.

Integrating established models of responsiveness and intimacy with theory and research on self-esteem, we present a model that highlights the ways in which self-esteem impacts intimacy-building. A review of relevant research reveals that compared to people with high self-esteem, people with low self-esteem exhibit interpersonal perceptions and behaviors that can hinder intimacy development-for example, disclosing less openly, and eliciting and perceiving less responsiveness from others. We identify important directions for future research and consider methods for encouraging intimacy-promoting processes among people with low self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "We explored the unique roles that body and genital image play in behavior-specific orgasm consistency, beyond overall sexual self-esteem. US adults (N = 599; 64% women) completed questionnaires online. Hierarchical regression analyses predicted orgasm consistency during receptive oral sex and penile-vaginal intercourse (PVI) with additional clitoral stimulation (WAS) and with no additional clitoral stimulation (NAS) for the woman. Body image, genital image, and gender were entered in later steps to assess model improvement above sexual self-esteem. Models accounted for age, sexual and racial minority identities, and current relationship status. Results indicated that genital image improved all models and predicted higher orgasm consistency across all behaviors for men and women. For orgasm during receptive oral sex and PVI-NAS, sexual self-esteem was no longer significant once genital image was included. Genital image was a stronger predictor of women's versus men's orgasm during PVI-NAS; no significant gender differences were found for oral sex and PVI-WAS. Body image was not significant in any models, contrary to expectations, suggesting role overlap with sexual self-esteem. Genital image appears to play a unique role in sexual pleasure beyond overall sexual self-esteem and body image.",

The main purpose of the research was to identify and compare the levels of self-esteem and self-confidence of athletes practicing individual and team sports. The self-esteem and self-confidence levels were measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg 1979) and the Self-Confidence Test (Romek, 2000). All participants were males. Subjects were divided into two categories: 40 for individual sports and 40 for team sports. There were two evaluation periods: P1, the beginning of the preparation period, and P2, the beginning of the competition period. There were statistically significant differences for P1 (",

      "abstract": "Evidence suggests that self-esteem is an important mechanism in pathways to psychosis. However, whether low or high self-esteem is associated with psychotic experiences remains unclear. Besides, a limited number of studies has investigated fluctuations in state self-esteem in psychotic patients. This study investigated cross-sectional and temporal associations of momentary self-esteem and fluctuations in self-esteem with psychotic symptoms in three groups with different levels of (familial) liability to psychotic disorder. Using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), momentary self-esteem, fluctuations in self-esteem (i.e., variability and instability), and psychotic experiences, paranoia, negative symptoms (i.e., event anhedonia and social anhedonia), intensity of negative affect and altered affective experiences (instability and variability in negative affect) were assessed in 147 psychotic patients, 131 of their siblings and 113 controls. Lower levels of momentary self-esteem were associated with an increased intensity of psychotic experiences, paranoia and negative affect, with the magnitude of the associations for momentary self-esteem being greatest in patients, followed by relatives. Variability in self-esteem was associated with psychotic and paranoid experiences, the magnitudes were greatest in relatives. Furthermore, we found reciprocal effects between momentary self-esteem and psychotic experiences, paranoia, negative affect, and instability in negative affect. These findings suggest that individuals with familial liability to psychosis (patients and their first-degree relatives) might benefit from targeting momentary self-esteem and variability in self-esteem to decrease the intensity of psychotic experiences, paranoia, and negative affect in daily life.

Hence, the present study is the first to apply terror management theory (TMT) and use experimental methods to examine whether reminders of death lead to increased stigma towards suicide and whether self-esteem moderates these stigmatized reactions. Consistent with the predicted effect of the death anxiety and self-esteem hypothesis, findings revealed that, for respondents with low self-esteem, thinking about their own death led to more stigma, less willingness to intervene, and allocated less money to a suicide prevention organization as compared to those who did not think about death. Findings from this study could have important implications for how we understand the psychological underpinnings of stigma and the role of death anxiety in hostile attitudes and decreased altruism - especially for mental health professionals working with individuals affected by suicide.",

There was no statistically significant difference between the AN and the BN group in clinical scale scores. Thirty percent of AN and 23.3% of BN patients showed \"poor insight\" according to BABS. In the whole sample, BABS scores were significantly positively correlated with the EDE-Q eating, shape, weight concern subscales, and global scores, and the RSES scores; and negatively correlated with the BISQ general appearance and trunk subscale scores. Manifestation of \"poor insight\" is frequent in EDs. Poor insight in EDs is associated with eating, shape and weight concerns, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem.",

Studies were included if they assessed bivariate associations between self-esteem and attachment security with mothers and/or fathers, or with both parents in general. A systematic search in the electronic databases PSYCINFO, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PSYNDEX identified 202 studies with 81,485 participants that were included in this multilevel meta-analysis. Criteria from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool were used for assessing the quality of the individual studies. Most studies assessed security with verbal measures (190 studies), and the mean age of participants was 16.5 years. We found a moderate positive concurrent correlation of attachment security to parents with self-esteem (",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been a noticeable increase in the interest in aesthetic and corrective surgery regardless of a patient's age. Both aesthetical and practical considerations are a motivation for patients undergoing plastic surgery. The goal of this study is to analyze dependencies between welfare, self-assessment and body self-perception in patients that qualified for plastic and aesthetic surgical procedures. The study group included 164 female patients, of whom 124 patients filled out a questionnaire before and after surgery. The questionnaire included demographic data and scales such as the Body Esteem Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale-SES, the Satisfaction with Life Scale-SWLS, the Flourishing Scale and the Scale of Positive and Negative Experience-SPANE. The first hypothesis concerned the subjective assessment of body self-perception after the procedure. The results of the study confirm this hypothesis-female patients after surgery rate their body self-perception higher, which indicates a positive influence of plastic and aesthetic surgery that increased in the subjective assessment of 66 examined patients. Moreover, the study revealed a higher self-assessment after procedures. On the other hand, the results indicated that younger patients had a higher body assessment, but there was no increase in self-assessment. Except for breast augmentation surgery, there was no influence on self-assessment and life satisfaction improvement after other surgical procedures. In patients up to 48 years old, after surgery, there was a significant dependence between subjective body self-assessment and all surveyed forms of welfare. In the case of patients after 48 year of age, there was a relationship between life satisfaction and body self-perception both before and after surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Women wearing makeup are perceived by others as more attractive, competent, dominant, and more socially prestigious. Individuals differ in how much and how frequently they use makeup. Some studies show that women with lower self-esteem use more makeup, probably to hide imperfections. However, women with higher self-esteem can also use makeup to attract attention. This study verified whether social and general self-esteem and body image are associated with makeup usage in Brazilian women. We collected data from 1,483 women (Mage = 31.08; SD = 11.15) about body image (appearance orientation and appearance evaluation), social self-esteem, general self-esteem, and makeup usage (frequency of makeup usage, time spent applying makeup per day, and money spent on makeup per month). Appearance orientation positively predicted frequency of makeup usage, time spent applying makeup, and money spent on makeup, whereas appearance evaluation inversely predicted money spent on makeup per month. Social self-esteem and general self-esteem also positively predicted money spent on makeup, but in different directions. The results suggest that the significance given to appearance and social interactions are importantly associated with makeup usage in women.",

The present research created an efficient six-item version of the SSES that preserves score reliability and validity and its three-dimensional structure: social, appearance, and performance self-esteem. Item response theory and confirmatory factor analyses identified the \"best\" six items-two from each dimension (Study 1). Participants completed the SSES four times at 2-week intervals (Studies 2 and 3). The six-item SSES' scores showed adequate test-retest reliability, explained substantial variance in trait-relevant measures, and showed convergent validity with related self-esteem measures. Participants completed the SSES and a laboratory experiment where they received negative feedback on an essay they had written and could retaliate against their evaluator by allocating hot sauce for them to consume (Study 4). The six-item SSES interacted with self-esteem instability in expected ways to predict hot sauce allocated.",

      "abstract": "Having a stable and good self-esteem is important for maintaining a good mental health. However, having low self-esteem is a risk factor for developing depressive, anxious, or uncooperative/aggressive symptoms. While many individuals with an autism spectrum disorder have these symptoms, there is a lack of studies on self-esteem in this group. We studied self-esteem of youth with autism spectrum disorder and the connection to their co-occurring symptoms. To do this, different self-esteem profiles were investigated, including explicit self-esteem (how someone says their self-esteem is after reflecting on it), implicit self-esteem (how someone's self-esteem is on a task that does not give them time to reflect on it), and the difference between both (high explicit with low implicit self-esteem or low explicit with high implicit self-esteem). Our results show that youth with autism spectrum disorder report lower self-esteem than youth without autism spectrum disorder when they have reflected on it (explicit self-esteem). And parents of children with autism spectrum disorder report that their children have even lower self-esteem. Implicit self-esteem was the same for youth with and without autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, we found that within youth with autism spectrum disorder, there was a negative relationship between explicit self-esteem and depressive symptoms, and between implicit self-esteem and externalizing behavior. Taken together, youth with autism spectrum disorder are at risk for developing low self-esteem and when they do they have a higher risk of developing co-occurring problems. Therefore we stress that it is important to measure and improve the self-esteem of youth with autism spectrum disorder, so they develop less co-occurring problems and have a higher quality of life.",

To investigate this, we examined 198 preschoolers (96 girls and 102 boys) and their parents (170 mothers and 28 fathers). We assessed children's implicit and explicit self-esteem, whereas parents' reported on both personal relative deprivation and the family's economic objective deprivation. In addition, we explored children's money knowledge as a moderator. Our findings reveal that preschoolers may connect their implicit self-esteem with family economic status; however, such connections require basic knowledge about money. We discuss potential explanations for the influence of family economic deprivation, specifically on the implicit-not explicit-self-esteem of preschoolers.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (BD) often overlap. In some cases, it is difficult to conduct a differential diagnosis based only on current diagnostic criteria Therefore, it is important to find clinical factors with high discriminatory specificity that, used together with structured or semi-structured interviews, could help improve diagnostic practice. We propose that a clinical analysis of identity, self-concept and self-esteem may help distinguish the two disorders, when they are not co-morbid. Our review of the studies that analyse these constructs in BD and BPD, separately, points in the direction of qualitative differences between the two disorders. In BPD, there is a well-documented identity diffusion, and the self-concept appears predominantly negative; shifts in self-concept and self-esteem are often tied to interpersonal triggers. In BD, patients struggle with their identity, but narrative identity might be less compromised compared with BPD; the shifts in self-concept and self-esteem appear more linked to internal (i.e. mood and motivational) factors. We end the paper by discussing the implications for clinicians and ideas for future comparative research.",

      "abstract": "The associations between insecure attachment (anxious and avoidant dimensions), maladaptive relational attributions, self-esteem, and psychological aggression were examined in a sample of couples (N = 96 couples) across the early years of marriage. Studying these constructs within a single sample is a novel contribution to the literature. Attachment was assessed at marriage, whereas maladaptive attributions, self-esteem, and psychological aggression were evaluated annually over the first 7 years of marriage. For the present study, specific maladaptive relational attributions about the spouse's hypothetical aggressive behavior were investigated. Data from both spouses were examined simultaneously using growth curve analytic and actor-partner interdependence modeling techniques. Results indicated that self locus attributions (i.e., attributing the cause of the spouse's hypothetical aggressive behavior to the self), intentionality attributions (i.e., attributing the spouse's motivation for the hypothetical behavior as intentional), and self-esteem were predicted by insecure attachment and covaried longitudinally with psychological aggression. Husbands' self-esteem and wives' intentionality attributions were particularly consistent in these associations. The results replicate and extend previous research by examining these constructs using a longitudinal dyadic approach. The findings of this study provide specific targets for intervention efforts to reduce psychological aggression and support conceptualizing psychological aggression within a dyadic and dynamic framework.

      "abstract": "Despite the growing prevalence of research on Internet hate, little is still known about the psychological factors that differentiate those who are negatively affected by being subjected to Internet hate and those who are not affected at all or only to a small degree. In the present studies, we aimed to verify if resilience and self-esteem could be predictors of such responses. A total of 60 public figures (politicians, athletes, and artists; 46.7% women) and 1128 ordinary Internet users (25.1% women) participated in the study. Participants completed The Brief Resilience Scale, The Self-Esteem Scale, and The Internet Hate Concern Scale, which was created for this study, and determined how often they experience hate online. The results showed that the public figures experience Internet hate more often but were less concerned with it than the ordinary Internet users, who received online hate less often, but were more worried about it. In both groups, high self-esteem and high resilience were negative predictors of greater concern with received online hate. Our study is the first step to understanding what makes the difference between people who cope well and are not particularly concerned, and people who are greatly affected by received Internet hate.",

      "abstract": "The psychological well-being of students affects their academic achievement, social relationships and school coexistence and is something that families worry about. This aspect becomes vital when students have atypical development and/or specific needs. Studies on the impact of giftedness on students' self-concept and self-esteem offer mixed results. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a key factor for their well-being that must be developed by educational institutions. This study analyzes the relationships between emotional intelligence profiles and both self-concept and self-esteem of identified gifted students between 8 and 18 years of age who study in regular Spanish schools and non-identified peers. A total of 118 identified gifted and 122 non-identified subjects participated in the study. The Self-Concept Scale Form 5 (AF5), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale-24 (TMMS-24) were administered. Clusters of students were identified on the basis of their scores in the three dimensions of EI. Subsequently, the differences in self-esteem and self-concept according to the student's emotional intelligence profile were analyzed. The results showed a taxonomy of three-cluster profiles in both groups and the existence of differences between profiles of EI in the self-esteem and self-concept dimensions in gifted students, not so in the non-identified group. The results have important implications for education and health professionals, both for the evaluation and for the introduction of adjusted intervention programs in case of vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "Body image (BI) and self-esteem (SE) are two fundamental aspects in the evolution of breast cancer (BC), mainly due to surgery, treatment, and the patient's conception of BI. A dissatisfaction with BI and low SE decreases the subject's quality of life and increases the risk of recurrence and mortality by BC. The aim of this study is to find out if there is any degree of association between the sociodemographic data of the sample and their BI and SE. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted with 198 women diagnosed with BC, aged 30-80 years, in Mexico. Women's BI and SE were assessed using two questionnaires, Hopwood Body Image Scale (S-BIS) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). The results show significant differences in several items when the variable sense of humor is taken into account, indicating that women with a sense of humor report higher satisfaction with their BI and higher SE. The age also indicates a significantly better BI in women over 50 years of age, as well as the education level variable, where those women who had studied up to secondary reported higher satisfaction with their BI; the family history shows that those women without a family history report better SE. All these data are supported by stepwise regression, which shows that educational level and sense of humor are predictors of BI, and family history along with breast reconstruction and sense of humor are predictors as of SE. In conclusion, it is important to take into account the characteristics of women with BC, particularly age and sense of humor, in order to reduce the impact of the disease on their BI and SE with the help of a multidisciplinary team.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this review is to shed light on the literature regarding the psychological impact of invasive cosmetic surgery and to discuss future implications for research and clinical practice. Articles published through October 2021 were reviewed to answer the question, \"Does cosmetic surgery improve a patient's overall psychological health?\" Psychological well-being was examined through the lens of body image, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression scores. The studies revealed that although cosmetic surgery seems to boost patients' body image, other crucial aspects of psychological well-being may or may not similarly benefit. Notably, factors such as a patient's preoperative mental status, level of education, type of cosmetic procedure, postoperative healing time, sex, and age play a role in determining the direction and magnitude of psychological change after surgery. Limitations include the lack of diversity in study populations and the potential role of body dysmorphic disorder. Overall, researchers have concluded that cosmetic surgery improves body image but remain in disagreement on its effects on self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.",

Compared to online relaxation sessions, the OSC was more effective. Male DHH students and those whose parents were highly qualified exhibited less anxiety and higher self-esteem and self-efficacy at pretest (T1). Post-test (T2) male students having better educated parents responded better to the OSC. T2 anxiety was lower and self-esteem and academic self-efficacy was higher for liberal arts students and having stay-at-home parents compared with science and commerce students and whose parents worked outside home. Self-esteem was also positively moderated by better economic class and presence of siblings. Intervention compliance in terms of regular attendance and self-practice mediated the relationship between sociodemographic predictors and outcomes. Results support the biopsychosocial model and encourage the implementation of the OSC with DHH university students.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s, self-esteem has become a cornerstone of Western child-rearing. After reviewing a large body of rigorous longitudinal research, Orth and Robins (2022) conclude that self-esteem brings modest but significant benefits across all ages. However, the authors did not intend to suggest strategies for raising children's self-esteem. The aim of my commentary is to identify such strategies. Without guidance on how to raise children's self-esteem safely and sustainably, well-intentioned strategies, such as inflated praise, may inadvertently undermine self-esteem or even breed narcissism. Instead, interventions should be based on a theoretically informed and empirically supported understanding of the determinants of self-esteem. By targeting these determinants, interventions may be able to raise children's self-esteem safely (i.e., without breeding narcissism) and sustainably (i.e., leading to lasting improvements in self-esteem and its presumed outcomes). Evaluating these interventions through randomized controlled trials will help build a theory of when and why self-esteem interventions work. Ultimately, this work will provide nuanced and dependable guidance to parents, teachers, and professionals on how to raise children's self-esteem.

As a consequence, new methods are developed. Some of the recent theories indicate that self-esteem is not a stable personality trait, but a dynamic construct fluctuating as a result of (mostly) social interactions. I present a semi-structured interview protocol as a method of data collection which can provide rich verbal and non-verbal material referring to self-esteem regulation. Analysis system is not included as there can be many different approaches to use collected data, e.g. qualitative content analysis or narrative inquiry methods. In this paper, I present exemplary statements of participants corresponding to every part of the interview. The examples are explained considering theoretical background. Finally, the strengths and limitations of presented method are discussed, as well as possible research areas to explore with it.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic systemic disease affecting 1 in 10 people assigned female at birth, that can result in appearance-based and functional bodily changes which can negatively impact body image. Empirical evidence supports the body dissatisfaction-driven hypothesis that negative body image leads to greater depressive symptoms; but potential underlying mechanisms are under-researched. This prospective study investigated the mediating role of two theoretically-derived intervening factors, self-esteem and rumination, in individuals living with endometriosis who typically report high rates of body image concerns and depressive symptoms. Initially, 996 participants completed the first online survey (T0) assessing demographic, medical and psychological factors. Of these, 451 completed surveys at 1-month (T1) and 2-months (T2) follow-up assessing self-esteem, rumination and depression. Bootstrapped analyses with full-information maximum likelihood estimation indicated that poor body image (T0) predicted greater depressive symptoms over time (T2). Self-esteem (T1), but not rumination (T1), mediated the body image-depression relationship. These results provide support for the body dissatisfaction-driven hypothesis and further identify that self-esteem is a key meditating factor. This highlights the importance of addressing self-esteem in body image focused interventions.",

The breathing conditions are (1) cyclic sighing, which emphasizes prolonged exhalations; (2) box breathing, which is equal duration of inhalations, breath retentions, and exhalations; and (3) cyclic hyperventilation with retention, with longer inhalations and shorter exhalations. The primary endpoints are improvement in mood and anxiety as well as reduced physiological arousal (respiratory rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability). Using a mixed-effects model, we show that breathwork, especially the exhale-focused cyclic sighing, produces greater improvement in mood (p < 0.05) and reduction in respiratory rate (p < 0.05) compared with mindfulness meditation. Daily 5-min cyclic sighing has promise as an effective stress management exercise.",

Contemporary research has helped to explain the physiological, neurological, and psychological reasons underlying this phenomenon. Nostalgic memories triggered by taste and smell are especially self-relevant, arousing, and familiar. These memories have an even more positive emotional profile than nostalgic memories elicited by other means, with individuals reporting lower levels of negative or ambivalent emotions. Scent-evoked and food-evoked nostalgia also confer numerous psychological benefits, including enhanced self-esteem, feelings of social connectedness, and deeper meaning in life.

      "abstract": "Affective experiences are commonly represented by either transient emotional reactions to discrete events or longer term, sustained mood states that are characterized by a more diffuse and global nature. While both have considerable influence in shaping memory, their interaction can produce mood-congruent memory (MCM), a psychological phenomenon where emotional memory is biased toward content affectively congruent with a past or current mood. The study of MCM has direct implications for understanding how memory biases form in daily life, as well as debilitating negative memory schemas that contribute to mood disorders such as depression. To elucidate the factors that influence the presence and strength of MCM, here we systematically review the literature for studies that assessed MCM by inducing mood in healthy participants. We observe that MCM is often reported as enhanced accuracy for previously encoded mood-congruent content or preferential recall for mood-congruent autobiographical events, but may also manifest as false memory for mood-congruent lures. We discuss the relevant conditions that shape these effects, as well as instances of mood-incongruent recall that facilitate mood repair. Further, we provide guiding methodological and theoretical considerations, emphasizing the limited neuroimaging research in this area and the need for a renewed focus on memory consolidation. Accordingly, we propose a theoretical framework for studying the neural basis of MCM based on the neurobiological underpinnings of mood and emotion. In doing so, we review evidence for associative network models of spreading activation, while also considering alternative models informed by the cognitive neuroscience literature of emotional memory bias.

However, there are no published clinical trials to corroborate these findings in humans. The primary objective of this study was to examine acute effects of CBG on anxiety, stress, and mood. Secondary objectives were to examine whether CBG produces subjective drug effects or motor and cognitive impairments. A double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over field trial was conducted with 34 healthy adult participants. Participants completed two sessions (with a one-week washout period) via Zoom. In each, they provided ratings of anxiety, stress, mood, and subjective drug effects prior to double-blind administration of 20 mg hemp-derived CBG or placebo tincture (T0). These ratings were collected again after participants ingested the product and completed an online survey (T1), the Trier Social Stress Test (T2), a verbal memory test and the DRUID impairment app (T3). Relative to placebo, there was a significant main effect of CBG on overall reductions in anxiety as well as reductions in stress at T1. CBG also enhanced verbal memory relative to placebo. There was no evidence of subjective drug effects or impairment. CBG may represent a novel option to reduce stress and anxiety in healthy adults.",

In this study, we used an inducible DCM-RNA polymerase subunit b fusion protein which labels active genes and enhancers with a bacterial methylation mark that does not affect gene transcription and is propagated in S-phase. This DCM-RNA polymerase fusion protein enables transcribed genes and active enhancers to be tagged and then examined at later stages of development or differentiation. We apply this DCM-time machine (DCM-TM) technology to study intestinal homeostasis, revealing rapid and coordinated activation of enhancers and nearby genes during enterocyte differentiation. We provide new insights in absorptive-secretory lineage decision-making in intestinal stem cell (ISC) differentiation and show that ISCs retain a unique chromatin landscape required to maintain ISC identity and delineate future expression of differentiation-associated genes. DCM-TM has wide applicability in tracking cell states, providing new insights in the regulatory networks underlying cell state changes.",

      "abstract": "Hematological malignancies affecting either the lymphoid or the myeloid lineages involve epigenetic mutations or dysregulation in the majority of cases. These epigenetic abnormalities can affect regulatory elements in the genome and, particularly, enhancers. Recently, large regulatory elements known as super-enhancers, initially identified for their critical roles in cell-type specific expression regulation of genes controlling cell identity, have been shown to also be involved in tumorigenesis in many cancer types and hematological malignancies via the regulation of numerous oncogenes, including MYC. In this review, we highlight the existing links between super-enhancers and hematological malignancies, with a particular focus on acute myeloid leukemia, a clonal hematopoietic neoplasm with dismal outcomes, resulting in an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloblasts, abnormally blocked during differentiation and accumulating within the patient's bone marrow. We report recent works, performed during the last few years, treating this subject and consider the possibility of targeting oncogenic regulatory elements, as well as the effectiveness and limitations reported so far for such strategies.",

In fact, a non-negligible fraction of eRNAs seems to be longer, spliced and more stable, and their cognate enhancers are epigenomically and functionally distinguishable from typical enhancers. In this review, we first summarized the genomic and molecular origins underlying the observed heterogeneity among eRNAs. Then, we discussed how their heterogeneous properties (e.g. stability) affect the modes of interaction with their regulatory partners, from promiscuous cis-interactions to specific trans-interactions. Finally, we highlighted the existence of a seemingly continuous spectrum of eRNA properties and its implications in the genomic origins of non-coding RNA genes from an evolutionary perspective.",

To resolve this apparent conflict and determine whether and how the hippocampus supports memory encoding under cortisol, we combined behavioral assays of associative memory, high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and pharmacological manipulation of cortisol in a within-participant, double-blinded procedure. Hydrocortisone led to enhanced functional connectivity between hippocampal subregions, which predicted subsequent memory enhancements for emotional information. Cortisol also modified the relationship between hippocampal representations and memory: whereas hippocampal signatures of distinctiveness predicted memory under placebo, relative integration predicted memory under cortisol. Together, these data provide novel evidence that the human hippocampus contains the necessary machinery to support emotional memory enhancements under stress.",

Biomarkers using brain-wide activity patterns in humans have proven useful in distinguishing between disorder subtypes and identifying effective treatments. In order to improve biomarker identification, it is crucial to understand the basic circuitry underpinning brain-wide activity patterns. Leveraging a large repertoire of techniques, animal studies have examined roles of specific cell types and circuits in driving maladaptive behavior. Recent advances in multiregion recording techniques, data-driven analysis approaches, and machine-learning-based behavioral analysis tools can further push the boundary of animal studies and bridge the gap with human studies, to assess how brain-wide activity patterns encode and drive emotional behavior. Together, these efforts will allow identifying more precise biomarkers to enhance diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Sexual motivation (desire) requires the simultaneous presence of an active central motive state and a stimulus with sexual significance. Once activated, sexual motivation leads to visceral responses and approach behaviors directed toward the emitter of the sexual stimulus. In humans, such behaviors follow cognitive evaluation of the context, including predictions of the approached individual's response. After successful approach and establishment of physical contact, manifest sexual activities may be initiated. Sexual interaction is associated with and followed by a state of positive affect in most animals, whereas aversive consequences may be experienced by humans. The affective reactions may become associated with stimuli present during sexual interaction, and these stimuli may thereby alter their incentive properties. Here we show how the incentive motivation model can be used to explain the origins and possible treatments of sexual dysfunctions, notably disorders of desire. We propose that associations formed between negative outcomes of sexual interaction and the salient stimuli, for example, the partner, underlies hypoactive desire disorder. Highly positive outcomes of sexual interaction enhance the incentive value of the stimuli present, and eventually lead to hyperactive sexual desire. Treatments aim to alter the impact of sexual incentives, mainly by modifying cognitive processes.",

This memory boost is commonly attributed to the elicited affective response, closely linked to noradrenergic and dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal plasticity. Herein we review and compare this 'affect' mechanism to an additional, recently discovered, 'prediction' mechanism whereby memories are strengthened by the extent to which outcomes deviate from expectations, that is, by prediction errors (PEs). The mnemonic impact of PEs is separate from the affective outcome itself and has a distinct neural signature. While both routes enhance memory, these mechanisms are linked to different - and sometimes opposing - predictions for memory integration. We discuss new findings that highlight mechanisms by which emotional events strengthen, integrate, and segment memory.",

      "abstract": "Progesterone is a highly lipophilic gonadal hormone that can influence behavior and mental health through its receptors in the brain. Fluctuations in progesterone levels across critical periods of a females life are associated with increased susceptibility to mental conditions. This review highlights the effects of progestagens, including progesterone and synthetic progestins, on the brain, mood, stress, and cognition in females. The primary focus is on experimental pharmacological research that teases out the distinct effects of progestagens from those of estrogens. Additionally, the key literature on puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, perimenopause, hormonal contraceptives, and menopausal hormone therapy is reviewed, although conclusions are limited by the nested effects of progestagens and estrogens. Single study-findings suggest an influence of progesterone on amygdala reactivity related to processing of emotional stimuli and memory. In patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, progesterone receptor modulation improves premenstrual mood symptoms and potentially enhances fronto-cingulate control over emotion processing. The interaction between progestagens and the systems involved in the regulation of stress seems to influence subjective experiences of mood and stress. Sparse studies investigating the effects of progestin-only contraceptives suggest effects of progestagens on the brain, mood, and stress. Progesterone and progestins used for contraception can influence neural processes as myelination and neuroprotection, exerting protective effects against stroke. Concerning menopausal hormonal therapy, the effects of progestins are largely unknown. Levels of progesterone as well as type, administration route, timing, dose regimen, metabolism, and intracellular activity of progestins in hormonal contraceptives and menopausal hormonal therapy are factors whose effects remain to be elucidated. Altogether, current knowledge highlights the potential role of progestagens in females health but also calls for well-designed pharmaco-behavioral studies disentangling the effects of progestagens from those of estrogens.",

In this pilot study, we aimed to establish a better understanding of the role of metacognition in functional seizures and its relationship to affective arousal and behavioral disinhibition (i.e., problems in suppressing prepared behavior). We hypothesized that affective arousal is related to higher behavioral disinhibition as well as slower reaction times, that affect and action (performing vs. not performing a movement) are related to memory and metacognition, and that metacognition is related to illness characteristics.",

Eighty-three participants (age 27.1 ± 8.0 years) from across five continents volunteered. Participants were assigned using matched groups based upon performance in a modified six-minute walk test to either an exercise (EXE) 3 × 30 min of walking/jogging per week, cognitive training (COG) 6 × 20 min per week, a combined group (COM) or the control (CON) who did not complete any intervention. Profile of Mood States (POMS) were assessed using a five-point scale across 65 categories pre- and post-study as well as upon completion of each week of the intervention. In addition, Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and self-efficacy using the Generalised Self-Efficacy scale (GSE) were recorded before and after the intervention. GSE increased for all participants by 1.9 ± 5.2 (",

      "abstract": "Stress, unhealthy lifestyle, and sleep disturbance worsen cognitive function in mood disorders, prompting a rise in the development of integrative health approaches. The recent investigations in the gut-brain axis field highlight the strong interplay among microbiota, inflammation, and mental health. Thus, this study aimed to investigate a new nutraceutical formulation comprising prebiotics, minerals, and silymarin's impact on microbiota, inflammation, mood, and sleep quality. The study evaluated the LL1 + silymarin capsule supplementation over 180 days in overweight adults. We analyzed the fecal gut microbiota using partial 16S rRNA sequences, measured cytokine expression via CBA, collected anthropometric data, quality of life, and sleep questionnaire responses, and obtained plasma samples for metabolic and hormonal analysis at baseline (T0) and 180 days (T180) post-supplementation. Our findings revealed significant reshaping in gut microbiota composition at the phylum, genus, and species levels, especially in the butyrate-producer bacteria post-supplementation. These changes in gut microbiota were linked to enhancements in sleep quality, mood perception, cytokine expression, and anthropometric measures which microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids might enhance. The supplementation tested in this study seems to be able to improve microbiota composition, reflecting anthropometrics and inflammation, as well as sleep quality and mood improvement.",

Salidroside is considered to be one of the main constituents responsible for the ergogenic actions of R. rosea.

      "abstract": "In the history of humanity, most conflicts within and between societies have originated from perceived inequality in resource distribution. How humans achieve and maintain distributive justice has therefore been an intensely studied issue. However, most research on the corresponding psychological processes has focused on inequality aversion and has been largely agnostic of other motives that may either align or oppose this behavioral tendency. Here we provide behavioral, computational, and neuroimaging evidence that distribution decisions are guided by three distinct motives-inequality aversion, harm aversion, and rank reversal aversion-that interact with each other and can also deter individuals from pursuing equality. At the neural level, we show that these three motives are encoded by separate neural systems, compete for representation in various brain areas processing equality and harm signals, and are integrated in the striatum, which functions as a crucial hub for translating the motives to behavior. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the cognitive and biological processes by which multiple prosocial motives are coordinated in the brain to guide redistribution behaviors. This framework enhances our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying equality-related behavior, suggests possible neural origins of individual differences in social preferences, and provides a new pathway to understand the cognitive and neural basis of clinical disorders with impaired social functions.",

      "title": "Coming full circle: On the origin and evolution of the looping model for enhancer-promoter communication.",
      "abstract": "In mammalian organisms, enhancers can regulate transcription from great genomic distances. How enhancers affect distal gene expression has been a major question in the field of gene regulation. One model to explain how enhancers communicate with their target promoters, the chromatin looping model, posits that enhancers and promoters come in close spatial proximity to mediate communication. Chromatin looping has been broadly accepted as a means for enhancer-promoter communication, driven by accumulating in vitro and in vivo evidence. The genome is now known to be folded into a complex 3D arrangement, created and maintained in part by the interplay of the Cohesin complex and the DNA-binding protein CTCF. In the last few years, however, doubt over the relationship between looping and transcriptional activation has emerged, driven by studies finding that only a modest number of genes are perturbed with acute degradation of looping machinery components. In parallel, newer models describing distal enhancer action have also come to prominence. In this article, we explore the emergence and development of the looping model as a means for enhancer-promoter communication and review the contrasting evidence between historical gene-specific and current global data for the role of chromatin looping in transcriptional regulation. We also discuss evidence for alternative models to chromatin looping and their support in the literature. We suggest that, while there is abundant evidence for chromatin looping as a major mechanism for enhancer function, enhancer-promoter communication is likely mediated by more than one mechanism in an enhancer- and context-dependent manner.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS), representing approximately 5% of all MS cases, affects the central nervous system during its ongoing development. POMS is most commonly diagnosed during adolescence but can occur in younger children as well. For pediatric patients with MS, it is critical to manage the full impact of the disease and monitor for any effects on school and social functioning. Disease management includes not only disease-modifying therapies but also strategies to optimize wellbeing. We review the interventions with the highest evidence of ability to improve the disease course and quality of life in POMS. High levels of vitamin D and a diet low in saturated fat are associated with lower relapse rates. Exercise ameliorates fatigue and sleep. Behavioral strategies for sleep hygiene and mood regulation can also improve fatigue and perceived health. POMS management should be addressed holistically, including assessing overall symptom burden as well as the psychological and functional impact of the disease.",

      "abstract": "The efficacy of individual cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for eating disorders can be assessed by investigating the potential predictors, mediators and moderators of treatment. The present review focused on personality since its crucial role has been emphasized both by research and practice. Sixteen studies were collected, and data were extracted through a highly operationalized coding system. Overall, personality disorders were the most investigated construct; however, their influence was somewhat contradictory. A more cogent result occurred for borderline personality disorder (BPD) when considered as a moderator (not a predictor nor a mediator). Patients with a more disturbed borderline personality benefited to a greater extent from treatments including booster modules on affects, interpersonal relationships and mood intolerance, rather than symptoms exclusively. Nine additional personality dimensions, beyond BPD, were investigated sparsely, and results regarding them were barely indicative in this review. However, some of these dimensions (e.g., affective lability and stimulus-seeking behaviours) could be traced back to BPD, thereby strengthening evidence of the role of borderline disorder as a moderator. Although research on the relationship between personality and eating disorders needs to be increased and methodologically improved, personality, taken as a whole, emerged as a promising variable for enhancing the efficacy of CBT.",

      "abstract": "Previously, most studies used 5-star and 1-star ratings to represent reviewers' positive and negative attitudes, respectively. However, this premise is not always true because individuals' attitudes have more than one dimension. In particular, given the credence traits of medical service, to build durable physician-patient relationships, patients may rate their physicians with high scores to avoid lowering their physicians' web-based ratings and help build their physicians' web-based reputations. Some patients may express complaints only in review texts, resulting in ambivalence, such as conflicting feelings, beliefs, and reactions toward physicians. Thus, web-based rating platforms for medical services may face more ambivalence than platforms for search or experience goods.",

Participants completed 56 days of daily diary surveys from Wave 1 of the Notre Dame Study of Health & Well-being. Multi-level modeling allowed us to assess the within-person relationships between daily stress and NA and the cross-level interactions between these daily relationships and cross-sectional age. Each type of stress additively related to daily NA. Older age related to an exacerbated relationship between daily interpersonal stressors and NA, but a weaker relationship between daily perceived stress and NA. Interventions focused on enhancing daily well-being can encourage older adults to ensure they do not have overpacked schedules in regards to social relationships, and encourage midlife and younger adults to engage in activities that disrupt the link between perceived stress and NA.",

      "abstract": "A cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment can trigger distress, negatively impact coping resources, and affect well-being as well as quality of life. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate feasibility and clinical effects of a VR intervention on quality of life, well-being and mood in cancer patients undergoing surgery compared to a non-VR intervention and a control group. 54 patients with colorectal cancer or liver metastases from colorectal cancer undergoing elective curatively intended surgery were recruited and randomised to one of two intervention groups or a control group receiving standard treatment. Participants assigned to one of the intervention groups either received a VR-based intervention twice daily or listened to music twice daily. Adherence to the intervention was 64.6% in the music group and 81.6% in the VR group. The VR intervention significantly reduced heart rate (- 1.2 bpm; 95% CI - 2.24 to - 0.22; p = 0.02) and respiratory rate (- 0.7 brpm; 95% CI - 1.08 to - 0.25; p = 0.01). Self-reported overall mood improved in both groups (VR: + 0.79 pts; 95% CI 0.37-1.21; p = 0.001; music: + 0.59 pts; 95% CI 0.22-0.97; p = 0.004). There was no difference in quality of life between the three groups. Both interventions groups reported changes in feelings. Adherence rates favoured the VR intervention over the music group. Observed clinical outcomes showed stronger intragroup effects on mood, feelings, and vital signs in the VR group. The study demonstrated feasibility of a VR intervention in cancer patients undergoing surgery and should encourage further research investigating the potential of VR interventions to positively influence well-being and mood in cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Acute social stress has been associated with increased immune system activation. However, less is known about whether non-social acute stressors also impact the immune response. In addition, most studies examine stressors that contain multiple characteristics (e.g., social, unpredictable) that could contribute to an increased immune response, but few studies have attempted to disentangle these factors. Finally, few studies have examined whether simultaneous changes in affect are associated with changes in the immune response. The present study used a between-subjects design to examine immune system activation, via changes in salivary cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1β, and tumour necrosis factor-α, in response to predictable and unpredictable electric shock. A multimodal assessment of changes in defencive motivation (startle reflex), attention (event-related potential probe N100, P300), and self-reported affect were evaluated to confirm the effectiveness of the threat manipulation. As expected, results indicated that the threat manipulation enhanced defencive motivation, attention, and self-reported affect. Across all participants, both predictable and unpredictable threat increased IL-8 but decreased IL-6. Greater changes in self-reported negative affect were associated with greater increases in the overall immune response. The present study suggests that acute non-social stress enhances immune system activation, particularly in those who experience greater changes in negative affect.",

      "abstract": "Humans spend on average 6.5 hours a day online. A large portion of that time is dedicated to information-seeking. How does this activity impact mental health? We assess this over four studies (n = 1,145). We reveal that the valence of information sought affects mental health, which in turn influences the valence of information sought, forming a self-reinforcing loop. We quantified the valence of text on webpages participants chose to browse using natural language processing and found that browsing more negative information was associated with worse mental health and mood. By manipulating the webpages browsed and measuring mood and vice versa, we show that the relationship is causal and bidirectional. Finally, we developed an intervention that altered web-browsing patterns in a manner that improved mood. Together, the findings suggest that the information sought reflects mental state and shapes it, creating a loop that may perpetuate mental health problems. The results also provide a potential method for assessing and enhancing welfare in the digital age.",

      "abstract": "The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is a hub for body sensation of both innocuous and noxious signals, yet its role in somatosensation versus pain is debated. Despite known contributions of S1 to sensory gain modulation, its causal involvement in subjective sensory experiences remains elusive. Here, in mouse S1, we reveal the involvement of cortical output neurons in layers 5 (L5) and 6 (L6) in the perception of innocuous and noxious somatosensory signals. We find that L6 activation can drive aversive hypersensitivity and spontaneous nocifensive behavior. Linking behavior to neuronal mechanisms, we find that L6 enhances thalamic somatosensory responses, and in parallel, strongly suppresses L5 neurons. Directly suppressing L5 reproduced the pronociceptive phenotype induced by L6 activation, suggesting an anti-nociceptive function for L5 output. Indeed, L5 activation reduced sensory sensitivity and reversed inflammatory allodynia. Together, these findings reveal a layer-specific and bidirectional role for S1 in modulating subjective sensory experiences.",

      "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is one of the most disabling mental disorders worldwide. Increasing preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted that compositional and functional (e.g., metabolite) changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, are associated with the onset and progression of depression via regulating the gut-brain axis. However, the gut microbiota and their metabolites present a double-edged sword in depression. Dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of depression while, at the same time, offering a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we describe the association between dysbiosis and depression, drug-microbiota interactions in antidepressant treatment, and the potential health benefits of microbial-targeted therapeutics in depression, including dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics. With the emergence of microbial research, we describe a new direction for future research and clinical treatment of depression.",

We posit that inflammatory depression is a meaningful depression subtype associated with specific symptoms and biological abnormalities. We review several upstream, potentially causative, mechanisms driving low-grade inflammation in this subtype of depression. We also discuss downstream mechanisms mediating the link between inflammation and symptoms of depression, including alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission and tryptophan metabolism. Finally, we review evidence for several non-pharmacological interventions for inflammatory depression, including probiotics, omega-3 fatty acids, and physical exercise interventions. While some evidence suggests that these interventions may be efficacious in inflammatory depression, future clinical trials should consider enriching patient populations for inflammatory markers, or stratify patients by inflammatory status, to confirm or refute this hypothesis.",

Dietary modifications and food supplements may be explored by some women as alternatives to hormone replacement therapy, although existing reviews and expert position statements have given this limited consideration. This narrative review summarises the current evidence for dietary patterns, and botanical and food supplements, in the management of common menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms (VMS; hot flushes; night sweats), changes in bodyweight and composition, psychological symptoms (depression; anxiety; cognitive changes), sleep disturbances, joint pain, skin changes and urogenital symptoms. Soy isoflavones may reduce the frequency and/or severity of VMS, although results are inconsistent, and it is unclear whether dietary and supplemental sources have comparable effects. Adopting a healthier dietary pattern may support a healthy bodyweight and benefit VMS. However, evidence suggesting dietary patterns may benefit depression, anxiety, and cognition remains largely observational. While some botanicals, such as black cohosh and St John's Wort, have been reported in some studies to alleviate symptoms (such as VMS and depression), these are not currently recommended due to uncertainty about the appropriate dose and preparation, and potential safety concerns. Evidence for other symptoms is currently too limited to draw conclusions. While further trials at different menopausal stages are needed, adopting a healthier dietary pattern in accordance with dietary guidelines is likely to help support women's health before, during and after the menopausal transition.",

      "abstract": "An emerging body of literature demonstrates differences in the gut microbiome (GMB) of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to healthy controls (HC), as well as the potential benefits of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic treatment. We conducted a systematic review of 24 observational studies (n = 2817), and 19 interventional trials (n = 1119). We assessed alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa abundance changes in patients with MDD relative to HC, as well as the effect of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical or subclinical depression. We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks. The GMB profiles of patients with MDD differ significantly from HC, but further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and over longer follow-up before these therapies are implemented into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "B vitamins are a group of 8 water-soluble vitamins. The body does not store them, so they need to be replaced daily. B vitamins are found in animal proteins, dairy products, leafy green vegetables, and beans. Overall, their function can generally be divided into catabolic metabolism, leading to energy production, and anabolic metabolism, resulting in bioactive molecules. They are critical cofactors for axonal transport, synthesis of neurotransmitters, and many cellular metabolic pathways. B vitamins are cofactors for many essential enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of RNA and DNA. B vitamin deficiencies have been considered as etiological factors in the development of various neurologic disorders and a broad spectrum of pathological states. Reductions in food intake and absorption efficiency in some populations, including the geriatric population, may warrant attention to their dietary B vitamin levels. Most B vitamins are generally safe even at intake levels reached with fortified food or supplements.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a primary source of disability worldwide, manifesting as disturbances in individuals' cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and behavioral patterns. In the quest to discover novel therapies and expand the boundaries of neuropharmacology, studies from the field have highlighted the gut microbiota's role in modulating these disorders. These alterations may influence the brain's processes through the brain-gut axis, a multifaceted bidirectional system that establishes a connection between the enteric and central nervous systems. Thus, probiotic and prebiotic supplements that are meant to influence overall gut health may play an insightful role in alleviating psychiatric symptoms, such as the cognitive templates of major depressive disorder, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Moreover, the administration of psychotropic drugs has been revealed to induce specific changes in a microbiome's diversity, suggesting their potential utility in combating bacterial infections. This review emphasizes the intricate correlations between psychiatric disorders and the gut microbiota, mentioning the promising approaches in regard to the modulation of probiotic and prebiotic treatments, as well as the antimicrobial effects of psychotropic medication.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common and complex mental and emotional disorder that causes disability, morbidity, and quite often mortality around the world. Depression is closely related to several physical and metabolic conditions causing metabolic depression. Studies have indicated that there is a relationship between the intestinal microbiota and the brain, known as the gut-brain axis. While this microbiota-gut-brain connection is disturbed, dysfunctions of the brain, immune system, endocrine system, and gastrointestinal tract occur. Numerous studies show that intestinal dysbiosis characterized by abnormal microbiota and dysfunction of the microbiota-gut-brain axis could be a direct cause of mental and emotional disorders. Traditional treatment of depression includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy, and it mainly targets the brain. However, restoration of the intestinal microbiota and functions of the gut-brain axis via using probiotics, their metabolites, prebiotics, and healthy diet may alleviate depressive symptoms. Administration of probiotics labeled as psychobiotics and their metabolites as metabiotics, especially as an adjuvant to antidepressants, improves mental disorders. It is a new approach to the prevention, management, and treatment of mental and emotional illnesses, particularly major depressive disorder and metabolic depression. For the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy, psychobiotics should be administered at a dose higher than 1 billion CFU/day for at least 8 weeks.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence demonstrates that alterations to the gut microbiota can affect mood, suggesting that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis contributes to the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these pathways overlap with the way in which the gut microbiota are thought to contribute to metabolic disease progression and obesity. In rodents, prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Together with germ-free rodent models, probiotics have provided compelling evidence for a causal relationship between microbes, microbial metabolites, and altered neurochemical signalling and inflammatory pathways in the brain. In humans, probiotic supplementation has demonstrated modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depressive symptoms, though more studies in clinically relevant populations are needed. This review critically discusses the role of the MGB axis in depression pathophysiology, integrating preclinical and clinical evidence, as well as the putative routes of communication between the microbiota-gut interface and the brain. A critical overview of the current approaches to investigating microbiome changes in depression is provided. To effectively translate preclinical breakthroughs in MGB axis research into novel therapies, rigorous placebo-controlled trials alongside a mechanistic and biochemical understanding of prebiotic and probiotic action are required from future research.",

      "abstract": "Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have received considerable attention in the field of mental health, in particular regarding the treatment of depression. This review presents an overview of current research on the role of omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders. The existing body of evidence demonstrates that omega-3 fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have antidepressant effects that can be attributed to their modulation of neuroinflammation, neurotransmitter function, and neuroplasticity. Nevertheless, clinical trials of omega-3 supplementation have yielded inconsistent results. Some studies have demonstrated significant reductions in depressive symptoms following omega-3 treatment, whereas others have shown minimal to no beneficial impact. A range of factors, encompassing dosage, the ratio of EPA to DHA, and baseline nutritional status, have been identified as having a potential impact on the noted results. Furthermore, it has been suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may act as an adjunctive treatment for those undergoing antidepressant treatment. Notwithstanding these encouraging findings, discrepancies in study designs and variability in individual responses underscore the necessity of further research in order to establish uniform, standardized guidelines for the use of omega-3 fatty acids in the management of depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "A promising new treatment approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) targets the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, which is linked to physiological and behavioral functions affected in MDD. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine whether short-term, high-dose probiotic supplementation reduces depressive symptoms along with gut microbial and neural changes in depressed patients. Patients with current depressive episodes took either a multi-strain probiotic supplement or placebo over 31 days additionally to treatment-as-usual. Assessments took place before, immediately after and again four weeks after the intervention. The Hamilton Depression Rating Sale (HAM-D) was assessed as primary outcome. Quantitative microbiome profiling and neuroimaging was used to detect changes along the MGB axis. In the sample that completed the intervention (probiotics N = 21, placebo N = 26), HAM-D scores decreased over time and interactions between time and group indicated a stronger decrease in the probiotics relative to the placebo group. Probiotics maintained microbial diversity and increased the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus, indicating the effectivity of the probiotics to increase specific taxa. The increase of the Lactobacillus was associated with decreased depressive symptoms in the probiotics group. Finally, putamen activation in response to neutral faces was significantly decreased after the probiotic intervention. Our data imply that an add-on probiotic treatment ameliorates depressive symptoms (HAM-D) along with changes in the gut microbiota and brain, which highlights the role of the MGB axis in MDD and emphasizes the potential of microbiota-related treatment approaches as accessible, pragmatic, and non-stigmatizing therapies in MDD.

In most cases, such complaints are not associated with overt vitamin B12 deficiency or advanced neurological disorders and the effectiveness of vitamin B12 supplementation in such cases is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is to assess the effects of vitamin B12 alone (B12 alone), in addition to vitamin B12 and folic acid with or without vitamin B6 (B complex) on cognitive function, depressive symptoms, and idiopathic fatigue in patients without advanced neurological disorders or overt vitamin B12 deficiency. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched. A total of 16 RCTs with 6276 participants were included. Regarding cognitive function outcomes, we found no evidence for an effect of B12 alone or B complex supplementation on any subdomain of cognitive function outcomes. Further, meta-regression showed no significant associations of treatment effects with any of the potential predictors. We also found no overall effect of vitamin supplementation on measures of depression. Further, only one study reported effects on idiopathic fatigue, and therefore, no analysis was possible. Vitamin B12 supplementation is likely ineffective for improving cognitive function and depressive symptoms in patients without advanced neurological disorders.",

      "title": "The brain-gut-microbiota interplay in depression: A key to design innovative therapeutic approaches.",
      "abstract": "Depression is the most prevalent mental disorder in the world associated with huge socio-economic consequences. While depressive-related symptoms are well known, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathophysiology and progression remain largely unknown. The gut microbiota (GM) is emerging as a key regulator of the central nervous system homeostasis by exerting fundamental immune and metabolic functions. In turn, the brain influences the intestinal microbial composition through neuroendocrine signals, within the so-called gut microbiota-brain axis. The balance of this bidirectional crosstalk is important to ensure neurogenesis, preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and avoid neuroinflammation. Conversely, dysbiosis and gut permeability negatively affect brain development, behavior, and cognition. Furthermore, although not fully defined yet, changes in the GM composition in depressed patients are reported to influence the pharmacokinetics of common antidepressants by affecting their absorption, metabolism, and activity. Similarly, neuropsychiatric drugs may shape in turn the GM with an impact on the efficacy and toxicity of the pharmacological intervention itself. Consequently, strategies aimed at re-establishing the correct homeostatic gut balance (i.e., prebiotics, probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and dietary interventions) represent an innovative approach to improve the pharmacotherapy of depression. Among these, probiotics and the Mediterranean diet, alone or in combination with the standard of care, hold promise for clinical application. Therefore, the disclosure of the intricate network between GM and depression will give precious insights for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches towards depression, with profound implications for drug development and clinical practice.",

      "title": "Mechanistic Insights into the Link between Gut Dysbiosis and Major Depression: An Extensive Review.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly common mental disorder, which is often multifactorial with sex, genetic, environmental, and/or psychological causes. Recent advancements in biomedical research have demonstrated a clear correlation between gut dysbiosis (GD) or gut microbial dysbiosis and the development of anxiety or depressive behaviors. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain through the neural, immune, and metabolic pathways, either directly (via vagal nerves) or indirectly (via gut- and microbial-derived metabolites as well as gut hormones and endocrine peptides, including peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y, cholecystokinin, corticotropin-releasing factor, glucagon-like peptide, oxytocin, and ghrelin). Maintaining healthy gut microbiota (GM) is now being recognized as important for brain health through the use of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, fecal microbial transplantation (FMT), etc. A few approaches exert antidepressant effects via restoring GM and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functions. In this review, we have summarized the etiopathogenic link between gut dysbiosis and depression with preclinical and clinical evidence. In addition, we have collated information on the recent therapies and supplements, such as probiotics, prebiotics, short-chain fatty acids, and vitamin B12, omega-3 fatty acids, etc., which target the gut-brain axis (GBA) for the effective management of depressive behavior and anxiety.",

The growing interest in the gut microbiota and mechanisms of its interaction with the brain has contributed to the considerable attention given to the potential use of probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics in the prevention and treatment of depressive disorders. This review discusses the up-to-date findings in preclinical and clinical trials regarding the use of pro-, pre- and postbiotics in depressive disorders. Studies in rodent models of depression show that some of them inhibit inflammation, decrease corticosterone level and change the level of neurometabolites, which consequently lead to mitigation of the symptoms of depression. Moreover, certain clinical studies have indicated improvement in mood as well as changes in biochemical parameters in patients suffering from depressive disorders.",

These disorders are among the leading causes of disability worldwide. Conventional pharmacotherapies usually have a poor response or adverse side effects. In this context, recent studies have demonstrated a dense bi-directional communication named gut-brain axis. Evidences are demonstrating the relationship between disturbance in the enteric microbiome and psychiatric disorders, paving the way for the emergence of alternative therapies. A systematic search for randomized double/triple blind placebo-controlled clinical trials was performed in PubMed, Scopus and Lilacs. The studies selection followed the recommendations of the main items for report systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Nine articles met the criteria and were analysed for effects on depression, anxiety, psychological stress and biomarkers. Seven found positive results in at least one of the items. We concluded that the use of probiotics to alleviate depressive symptoms and anxiety is promising, mainly due to its potential anti-inflammatory effect, but additional and more rigorous double blind randomized clinical trials are necessary to endorse such conclusions.",

It is known that the symbiotic interactions between the gut microbes and the host can affect mental health. The review analyzes the mechanisms and ways of action of the gut microbiota on the pathophysiology of depression. The possibility of using knowledge about the taxonomic composition and metabolic profile of the microbiota of patients with depression to select gene compositions (metagenomic signature) as biomarkers of the disease is evaluated. The use of in silico technologies (machine learning) for the diagnosis of depression based on the biomarkers of the gut microbiota is given. Alternative approaches to the treatment of depression are being considered by balancing the microbial composition through dietary modifications and the use of additives, namely probiotics, postbiotics (including vesicles) and prebiotics as psychobiotics, and fecal transplantation.

      "abstract": "Chronic stress manifests as depressive- and anxiety-like behavior while recurrent stress elicits disproportionate behavioral impairments linked to stress-induced immunological priming. The gut-brain-microbiota-axis is a promising therapeutic target for stress-induced behavioral impairments as it simultaneously modulates peripheral and brain immunological landscapes. In this study, a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, known as a synbiotic, promoted behavioral resilience to chronic and recurrent stress by normalizing gut microbiota populations and promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) expansion through modulation of ileal innate lymphoid cell (ILC)3 activity, an impact reflecting behavioral responses better than limbic brain region neuroinflammation. Supporting this conclusion, a multivariate machine learning model correlatively predicted a cross-tissue immunological signature of stress-induced behavioral impairment where the ileal Treg/T helper17 cell ratio associated to hippocampal chemotactic chemokine and prefrontal cortex IL-1β production in the context of stress-induced behavioral deficits. In conclusion, stress-induced behavioral impairments depend on the gut-brain-microbiota-axis and through ileal immune regulation, synbiotics attenuate the associated depressive- and anxiety-like behavior.",

      "title": "The burden and the challenge of treatment-resistant depression.",
      "abstract": "Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a serious public health problem. It is estimated that around 20- 40% of patients with a major depressive episode (whether monopolar or bipolar) do not exhibit clinical response to the current treatment with antidepressants, that is at least 50% decline in the symptoms scale. Furthermore, about half of the patients with symptom amelioration present residual symptoms which continue to negatively affect their functioning and increase the chance of relapse. Therefore, only 20-40% of patients (36.8% in STAR*D)1 who receive therapy for a major depressive episode for the first time exhibit remission (i.e., at least 70% decrease in symptom severity or HAMD score ≤7/MADRS score ≤10)2 - which is the goal of current treatments. Even when remission is achieved, though, there is often a long way to recovery and to the patient's return to the prior state of occupational and social functioning. Moreover, long-term medical treatment is needed in order to achieve and maintain the above.3 TRD is characterized by high rates of comorbidity (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure), doubles the rates of hospitalizations and lengthens the time of hospitalization by 36%, while the percentage of suicidal incidents is seven times higher in TRD compared to cases of treatment-responsive depression.4 TRD exhibits higher rates of mortality than treatment-responsive depression, with all-cause mortality rate being higher5 by 29-35% and similar to that of older by 13 years, non-depressed individuals. Despite its common occurrence and the fact that TRD constitutes an important issue in the treatment of major depression disorder (MDD), experts still disagree on the exact meaning of the term. The most widely accepted and used term of TRD refers to treatment resistance as treatment with at least two different antidepressants (of the same or different classes), administered in the right doses and for an adequate amount of time, with verified patient compliance to treatment which, however, fails to produce significant clinical results.6 Other terms have also been used as an alternative, for example Difficult to Treat Depression in order to avoid nihilism - something often seen in these cases;7 Drug Resistant Depression so as to determine the exact kind of resistance and also to underline the need for combination therapy with intervention such as psychotherapy and ECT; Multiple Therapy Resistant MDD; Pernicious Depression8 etc. Treatment of TRD is a challenge for every clinician. After excluding the possibility of pseudo-resistance due to misdiagnosis, insufficient therapeutic regimen, comorbid disorders, such as anxiety disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, substance abuse/addiction, PTSD, non-compliance to treatment, non-identified organicity and chronic stressors, the therapeutic methods used include: optimization, watchful waiting, past response, combination treatment, add-on treatments, ECT, TMS, vagus nerve stimulation, phototherapy, psychotherapy, neurosurgery. All the above are thoroughly discussed in this Supplement issue of Psychiatriki.9.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a kind of worldwide mental illness with the highest morbidity and disability rate, which is often accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Experiments have demonstrated that the disorder of the intestinal microbial system structure plays a crucial role in depression. The gut-brain axis manifests a potential linkage between the digestion system and the central nervous system (CNS). Nowadays, it has become an emerging trend to treat diseases by targeting intestinal microorganisms (e.g., probiotics) and combining the gut-brain axis mechanism. Combined with the research, we found that the incidence of depression is closely linked to the gut microbiota. Moreover, the transformation of the gut microbiota system structure is considered to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on the development of depression. This article reviewed the mechanism of bidirectional interaction in the gut-brain axis and existing symptom-relieving measures and antidepression treatments related to the gut microbiome.",

      "title": "The Role of Water-Soluble Vitamins and Vitamin D in Prevention and Treatment of Depression and Seasonal Affective Disorder in Adults.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a major global health concern expected to worsen by 2030. In 2019, 28 million individuals were affected by depressive disorders. Dietary and supplemental vitamins show overall favorable preventative and therapeutic effects on depression. B vitamins are crucial for neurological function and mood regulation. Deficiencies in these vitamins are linked to depression. Studies on individual B vitamins show promise in improving depressive symptoms, particularly thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and folate. Vitamin C deficiency may heighten depressive symptoms, but its exact role is not fully understood. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is associated with insufficient sunlight exposure and vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D supplementation for SAD shows inconsistent results due to methodological variations. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms of vitamins in depression treatment. Moreover, more research on SAD and light therapy's efficacy and underlying mechanisms involving photoreceptors, enzymes, and immune markers is needed. Although dietary and supplemental vitamins show overall favorable preventative and therapeutic effects on depression, dietitians treating psychiatric disorders face challenges due to diverse study designs, making direct comparisons difficult. Therefore, this article reviews the current literature to assess the role of dietary and supplemental vitamins in the prevention and treatment of depression. This review found that, although evidence supports the role of B vitamins and vitamins C and D in preventing and treating depression, further research is needed to clarify their mechanisms of action and determine the most effective intervention strategies.",

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on patients with depression. We searched six databases up to July 2022. In total, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 786 participants were included. The overall results demonstrated that patients who received prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics had significantly improved symptoms of depression compared with those in the placebo group. However, subgroup analysis only confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of agents that contained probiotics. In addition, patients with mild or moderate depression could both benefit from the treatment. Studies with a lower proportion of females reported stronger effects for alleviating depressive symptoms. In conclusion, agents that manipulate gut microbiota might improve mild-to-moderate depression. It is necessary to further investigate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and follow up with individuals over a longer time before these therapies are implemented in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that the gut microbiome influences the brain functions and psychological state of its host via the gut-brain axis, and gut dysbiosis has been linked to several mental illnesses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Animal experiments have shown that a depletion of the gut microbiota leads to behavioral changes, and is associated with pathological changes, including abnormal stress response and impaired adult neurogenesis. Short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate are known to contribute to the up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and gut dysbiosis causes decreased levels of BDNF, which could affect neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. Increased gut permeability causes an influx of gut microbial components such as lipopolysaccharides, and the resultant systemic inflammation may lead to neuroinflammation in the central nervous system. In light of the fact that gut microbial factors contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of depressive symptoms, this review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in MDD onset, and discusses the therapeutic potential of probiotics, including butyrate-producing bacteria, which can mediate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

Consequently, there is a need to discover new therapeutic methods to cope with depression faster and more effectively. Several lines of evidence indicate that the use of probiotic therapy reduces depressive symptoms. Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms linking the gut microbiota and the central nervous system, as well as the potential mechanisms of action for probiotics, are still not entirely clarified. The aim of this review was to systematically summarize the available knowledge according to PRISMA guidelines on the molecular mechanisms linking probiotics and healthy populations with subclinical depression or anxiety symptoms, as well as depressed patients with or without comorbid somatic illnesses. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. Twenty records were included. It has been found that probiotic administration is linked to a significant increase in BDNF levels during probiotic treatment compared to the placebo (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI [0.07, 0.68], ",

To provide an overview and in-depth analysis of temporal trends in prevalence of DD in older adults at global, regional, and national levels over the last 30 years. Here, an age-period-cohort model was adopted to analyze age, period, and cohort effects. We showed that the global prevalence of DD in older adults was increasing. The net drift of the global prevalence of DD was showing an increasing trend in 78 countries, while local drift showing a declining trend in all age groups in high sociodemographic index (SDI) region. Additionally, period and cohort effects exhibited different patterns across regions. Over time, the declining trend was most significant in high SDI regions, while this trend was most significant in middle SDI region. Interestingly, those aged 60-64 years to 70-74 years was increasing globally, while age group aged 75-79 years to 95-99 years was on declining. In high, high-middle, and low SDI regions, individuals born early face higher risks than those born late, while the opposite results were observed in low-middle SDI region. Overall, our findings offer a insight global perspective for studying the temporal trends of DD prevalence, supplementing our evidence and understanding of DD epidemiology, and identifying gaps in DD prevention, management, and intervention plans in different aspects.",

Probiotics like Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) may improve depressive symptoms by modulating the gut microbiota based on our previous open trial. We conducted an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the impact of PS128 on depression severity, markers of inflammation and gut permeability, and the gut microbiota composition in 32 patients with MDD with stable antidepressant treatment but moderate symptom severity. Following the 8-week intervention, both the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 score (HAMD), and Depression and Somatic Symptoms Scale (DSSS) showed a significant decrease in both groups (p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the change of depression severity between groups (p=0.203). Moreover, alterations in serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and intestinal fatty acid binding protein, as well as changes in the gut microbiota composition, did not exhibit significant differences before and after intervention or between the groups. In comparison to the placebo group, our study did not find significant effects of PS128 on depressive symptoms, biomarkers of inflammation and gut permeability, and the overall gut microbiota composition. Nonetheless, we observed a potential impact of PS128 on the symbiosis of specific taxa. To comprehensively understand the psychophysiological effects of PS128 in patients with MDD, further research with a larger sample size is imperative.",

In most cases, such complaints are not associated with overt vitamin B12 deficiency or advanced neurological disorders and the effectiveness of vitamin B12 supplementation in such cases is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is to assess the effects of vitamin B12 alone (B12 alone), in addition to vitamin B12 and folic acid with or without vitamin B6 (B complex) on cognitive function, depressive symptoms, and idiopathic fatigue in patients without advanced neurological disorders or overt vitamin B12 deficiency. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were searched. A total of 16 RCTs with 6276 participants were included. Regarding cognitive function outcomes, we found no evidence for an effect of B12 alone or B complex supplementation on any subdomain of cognitive function outcomes. Further, meta-regression showed no significant associations of treatment effects with any of the potential predictors. We also found no overall effect of vitamin supplementation on measures of depression. Further, only one study reported effects on idiopathic fatigue, and therefore, no analysis was possible. Vitamin B12 supplementation is likely ineffective for improving cognitive function and depressive symptoms in patients without advanced neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "The importance of diet and the gut-brain axis for brain health and cognitive function is increasingly acknowledged. Dietary interventions are tested for their potential to prevent and/or treat brain disorders. Intermittent fasting (IF), the abstinence or strong limitation of calories for 12 to 48 h, alternated with periods of regular food intake, has shown promising results on neurobiological health in animal models. In this review article, we discuss the potential benefits of IF on cognitive function and the possible effects on the prevention and progress of brain-related disorders in animals and humans. We do so by summarizing the effects of IF which through metabolic, cellular, and circadian mechanisms lead to anatomical and functional changes in the brain. Our review shows that there is no clear evidence of a positive short-term effect of IF on cognition in healthy subjects. Clinical studies show benefits of IF for epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis on disease symptoms and progress. Findings from animal studies show mechanisms by which Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, autism spectrum disorder, and mood and anxiety disorders could benefit from IF. Future research should disentangle whether positive effects of IF hold true regardless of age or the presence of obesity. Moreover, variations in fasting patterns, total caloric intake, and intake of specific nutrients may be relevant components of IF success. Longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) will provide a window into the long-term effects of IF on the development and progress of brain-related diseases.",

Modifiable lifestyle factors that cause a decline in cardiometabolic health, such as physical inactivity, exacerbate these changes beyond those that are associated with normal ageing. The purpose of this review was to examine cerebrovascular, cognitive and neuroanatomical adaptations to ageing and the potential benefits of exercise training on these outcomes in adults 50 years or older. We systematically searched for cross-sectional or intervention studies that included exercise (aerobic, resistance or multimodal) and its effect on cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroanatomical adaptations in this age demographic. The included studies were tabulated and described narratively. Aerobic exercise training was the predominant focus of the studies identified; there were limited studies exploring the effects of resistance exercise training and multimodal training on cerebrovascular function and cognition. Collectively, the evidence indicated that exercise can improve cerebrovascular function, cognition and neuroplasticity through areas of the brain associated with executive function and memory in adults 50 years or older, irrespective of their health status. However, more research is required to ascertain the mechanisms of action.",

Cognitive reserve is therefore a promising approach to maintaining cognitive function and protecting against symptoms of dementia. The present paper evaluates evidence supporting the claim that bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve. Four types of evidence are presented: (i) brain and cognitive function in healthy aging, (ii) age of onset of symptoms of dementia, (iii) relation between clinical level and neuropathology for patients, and (iv) rate of cognitive decline in later stages of dementia. In all cases, bilinguals revealed patterns that were consistent with the interpretation of protection from cognitive reserve when compared with monolinguals.",

Physical activity and sedentary behaviour have been identified as modifiable lifestyle behaviours associated with these cognitive conditions. Therefore, the aim of this bibliometric analysis is to reveal the knowledge structure of the field of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and cognitive function among older adults from 2004 to 2024, and to predict emerging research trends. A total of 1290 publications were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection. CiteSpace and VOSviewer were applied to conduct performance analysis, science mapping, and enrichment. T. Liu-Ambrose was the most prolific author (39 publications), and the University of British Columbia was the most prolific institution (48 publications). The USA, China, and Canada were the three most productive countries with 392, 174, and 136 publications respectively. Two research trends revealed the knowledge structure of this field, including the shift from evaluating the effectiveness of interventions on cognitive function to evaluating the effectiveness of interventions on other health-related outcomes, as well as an expansion of research on the role of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the context of healthy ageing. Sleep, sedentary behaviour, and virtual reality may be emerging research trends and may predict directions for future research. Collectively, this bibliometric analysis provides a one-step overview of the knowledge structure in this field for researchers and other stakeholders, as well as a reference for future research.",

      "abstract": "This chapter thoroughly examines coffee's impact on cognitive function. It synthesizes research findings involving animals and humans, investigating coffee's influence on various memory and cognitive aspects, including short-term/working memory, long-term memory, attention, vigilance, executive functions, and processing speed. The chapter also discusses moderating factors, such as dose-response relationships, individual differences, age, and habitual consumption patterns, that influence the cognitive effects of coffee. Additionally, it addresses the potential risks and adverse effects associated with coffee intake, memory, and cognitive function, including stress and anxiety, sleep disturbances, cardiovascular effects, and addiction. Studies suggest moderate coffee intake improves attention, processing speed, decision-making, and certain executive functions. However, the effects vary depending on factors like dosage, individual traits, age, and sleep habits. Despite potential benefits, coffee consumption may lead to adverse effects such as anxiety, sleep issues, cardiovascular concerns, and dependency. Future research should address methodological concerns, incorporate neuroimaging methods, explore interactions with other substances, and investigate long-term effects and therapeutic uses. Understanding coffee's neuroscience can shed light on its role in daily life and health.",

      "title": "The Central Mechanisms of Resistance Training and Its Effects on Cognitive Function.",
      "abstract": "Resistance exercise is used extensively in athletic and general populations to induce neuromuscular adaptations to increase muscle size and performance. Exercise parameters such as exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality are carefully manipulated to induce specific adaptations to the neuromuscular system. While the benefits of resistance exercise on the neuromuscular system are well documented, there is growing evidence to suggest that resistance exercise, even when performed acutely, can lead to neuroplastic changes within the central nervous system (CNS) and improve cognitive functioning. As such, resistance exercise has been proposed as a novel adjuvant rehabilitation strategy in populations that suffer from neurological or neurocognitive impairments (i.e. Parkinson's and Alzheimer's dementia) or even to attenuate age-related declines in cognitive health. In this review, we present evidence for the neuroplastic effects and cognitive benefits of resistance exercise and propose some of the underlying mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity following resistance training. We will further discuss the effects of exercise parameters, in particular exercise frequency, intensity, duration and modality to improve cognitive health. Lastly, we will highlight some of the existing limitations in the literature surrounding the use of resistance exercise to improve cognitive function and propose considerations to improve future studies in this field. In summary, the current evidence supports the role of resistance exercise, as a stand alone or in combination with aerobic exercise, for benefiting cognitive health and that it should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to treat age- or disease-related cognitive declines.",

      "title": "Sleep and longitudinal cognitive performance in preclinical and early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",
      "abstract": "Sleep monitoring may provide markers for future Alzheimer's disease; however, the relationship between sleep and cognitive function in preclinical and early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease is not well understood. Multiple studies have associated short and long sleep times with future cognitive impairment. Since sleep and the risk of Alzheimer's disease change with age, a greater understanding of how the relationship between sleep and cognition changes over time is needed. In this study, we hypothesized that longitudinal changes in cognitive function will have a non-linear relationship with total sleep time, time spent in non-REM and REM sleep, sleep efficiency and non-REM slow wave activity. To test this hypothesis, we monitored sleep-wake activity over 4-6 nights in 100 participants who underwent standardized cognitive testing longitudinally, APOE genotyping, and measurement of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers, total tau and amyloid-β42 in the CSF. To assess cognitive function, individuals completed a neuropsychological testing battery at each clinical visit that included the Free and Cued Selective Reminding test, the Logical Memory Delayed Recall assessment, the Digit Symbol Substitution test and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Performance on each of these four tests was Z-scored within the cohort and averaged to calculate a preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite score. We estimated the effect of cross-sectional sleep parameters on longitudinal cognitive performance using generalized additive mixed effects models. Generalized additive models allow for non-parametric and non-linear model fitting and are simply generalized linear mixed effects models; however, the linear predictors are not constant values but rather a sum of spline fits. We found that longitudinal changes in cognitive function measured by the cognitive composite decreased at low and high values of total sleep time (P < 0.001), time in non-REM (P < 0.001) and REM sleep (P < 0.001), sleep efficiency (P < 0.01) and <1 Hz and 1-4.5 Hz non-REM slow wave activity (P < 0.001) even after adjusting for age, CSF total tau/amyloid-β42 ratio, APOE ε4 carrier status, years of education and sex. Cognitive function was stable over time within a middle range of total sleep time, time in non-REM and REM sleep and <1 Hz slow wave activity, suggesting that certain levels of sleep are important for maintaining cognitive function. Although longitudinal and interventional studies are needed, diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances to optimize sleep time and slow wave activity may have a stabilizing effect on cognition in preclinical or early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease.",

      "title": "Physical activity for cognitive health promotion: An overview of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is one of the modifiable factors of cognitive decline and dementia with the strongest evidence. Although many influential reviews have illustrated the neurobiological mechanisms of the cognitive benefits of physical activity, none of them have linked the neurobiological mechanisms to normal exercise physiology to help the readers gain a more advanced, comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. In this review, we address this issue and provide a synthesis of the literature by focusing on five most studied neurobiological mechanisms. We show that the body's adaptations to enhance exercise performance also benefit the brain and contribute to improved cognition. Specifically, these adaptations include, 1), the release of growth factors that are essential for the development and growth of neurons and for neurogenesis and angiogenesis, 2), the production of lactate that provides energy to the brain and is involved in the synthesis of glutamate and the maintenance of long-term potentiation, 3), the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines that reduce neuroinflammation, 4), the increase in mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant enzyme activity that reduce oxidative stress, and 5), the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and 5-HT that regulate neurogenesis and modulate cognition. We also discussed several issues relevant for prescribing physical activity, including what intensity and mode of physical activity brings the most cognitive benefits, based on their influence on the above five neurobiological mechanisms. We hope this review helps readers gain a general understanding of the state-of-the-art knowledge on the neurobiological mechanisms of the cognitive benefits of physical activity and guide them in designing new studies to further advance the field.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the association between the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and dementia onset as well as cognitive function in patients with diabetes mellitus. We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases to select relevant studies published up to August 2023. The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors significantly lowers dementia risk compared to SGLT-2i non-users (Hazard ratio: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.50-0.92). Furthermore, our findings indicated a positive effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor use on cognitive function score improvement, as demonstrated by the standardized mean difference of 0.88 (95 % CI: 0.32-1.44), particularly among populations with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate a potential role of SGLT-2 inhibitors in reducing the risk of dementia in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings underscore the need for well-controlled large clinical trials and future research in this field.",

      "abstract": "Cognition is the most complex function of the brain. When exploring the inner workings of cognitive processes, it is crucial to understand the complexity of the brain's dynamics. This paper aims to describe the integrated framework of the cognitive function, seen as the result of organization and interactions between several systems and subsystems. We briefly describe several organizational concepts, spanning from the reductionist hierarchical approach, up to the more dynamic theory of open complex systems. The homeostatic regulation of the mechanisms responsible for cognitive processes is showcased as a dynamic interplay between several anticorrelated mechanisms, which can be found at every level of the brain's organization, from molecular and cellular level to large-scale networks (e.g., excitation-inhibition, long-term plasticity-long-term depression, synchronization-desynchronization, segregation-integration, order-chaos). We support the hypothesis that cognitive function is the consequence of multiple network interactions, integrating intricate relationships between several systems, in addition to neural circuits.",

The conference covered the latest developments in research related to neuronal energetics, emerging roles for glycogen in higher brain functions, the impact of dietary intervention on aging, memory, and Alzheimer's disease, roles of the microbiome in gut-brain signaling, astrocyte-neuron interactions related to cognition and memory, novel roles for mitochondria and their metabolites, and metabolic neuroimaging in aging and neurodegeneration. The special issue contains 25 manuscripts on these topics plus three tributes to outstanding scientists who have made important contributions to brain energy metabolism and participated in numerous ICBEM conferences. In addition, two of the manuscripts describe important directions and the rationale for future research in many thematic areas covered by the conference.",

The attentive state can be defined as a state of optimal activation that allows selecting the sources of information and courses of action in order to optimize our interaction with the environment in accordance with either the saliency of the stimulation or internal goals and intentions. In this article we argue that paying attention consists in tuning the mind with the environment in a conscious and controlled mode in order to enable the strategic and flexible adaptation of responses in accordance with internal motivations and goals. We discuss the anatomy and neural mechanisms involved in attention functions and present a brief overview of the neurocognitive development of this seminal cognitive function on the grounds of self-regulated behavior.

      "abstract": "The relationship between self-reported sleep and cognitive function is complex; it is unclear whether self-reported sleep is a robust correlate of people's cognitive function. We address this gap by using a comprehensive large-scale dataset (N = 1054) coupled with a novel modeling approach, specification curve analysis (SCA), to test the association between self-reported sleep and cognitive function. The results of the SCA showed robust correlations between self-reported sleep and cognitive function, with poorer sleep associated with worse cognitive function. Furthermore, the correlations between sleep components and cognitive function were heterogeneous, with differences emerging across cognitive measures and domains. Specifically, daytime dysfunction was associated with the strongest effect on subjective cognitive function, whereas sleep duration and sleep efficiency had the strongest effect on objective cognitive function. Therefore, the relationship between self-reported sleep and cognition depends largely on what and how cognitive function is measured. Our findings guide measurement and domain selection for future research on the role of sleep in cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "Previous research suggests that high allostatic load (AL), a biological indicator of physiological dysregulation due to chronic stress, is associated with poor cognitive functioning. To date, no studies have systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the strength and consistency of this relationship. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic and meta-analytic review of studies that have investigated the association between AL and performance on standardized cognitive tests among adults aged 18 years and older. A total of 18 studies were retained for review. Meta-analyses revealed a significant cross-sectional association between higher AL and poor global cognition (r = -0.08, p <  0.001) and executive function (r = -0.07, p =  0.02), but not memory (r = -0.07, p =  0.10). Due to variation in statistical methods used, longitudinal meta-analyses were not performed. Qualitative review of the literature suggests that AL algorithm, physiological systems and individual biomarkers included in the AL index, and sample age may be key moderators of the AL-cognition relationship. Although the magnitude of reported associations is small, findings support AL as a robust indicator of cognitive function among adults. Study limitations and future directions are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation contributes to impaired cognitive function in brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by the aggregation of pathological tau. One major driver of both age- and tau-associated neuroinflammation is the NF-κB and NLRP3 signaling axis. However, current treatments targeting NF-κB or NLRP3 may have adverse/systemic effects, and most have not been clinically translatable. In this study, we tested the efficacy of a novel, nucleic acid therapeutic (Nanoligomer) cocktail specifically targeting both NF-κB and NLRP3 in the brain for reducing neuroinflammation and improving cognitive function in old (aged 19 months) wildtype mice, and in rTg4510 tau pathology mice (aged 2 months). We found that 4 weeks of NF-κB/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomer treatment strongly reduced neuro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in the brain and improved cognitive-behavioral function in both old and rTg4510 mice. These effects of NF-κB/NLRP3-targeting Nanoligomers were also associated with reduced glial cell activation and pathology, favorable changes in transcriptome signatures of glia-associated inflammation (reduced) and neuronal health (increased), and positive systemic effects. Collectively, our results provide a basis for future translational studies targeting both NF-κB and NLRP3 in the brain, perhaps using Nanoligomers, to inhibit neuroinflammation and improve cognitive function with aging and neurodegeneration.",

A total of 611 men and 121 women aged 40-69 years who participated in physical function measurements between June 2017 and June 2021 were included in the study. The general physical function measurements of upper and lower limb muscle strength, dynamic and static balance, and agility and cognitive function included grip strength, Repeated Rise Test, Trail Making test (TMT), and Three-Meter Time Up Go Test (TUG). We also asked the men and women about their experience of falling and stumbling. Logistic regression analysis showed significant odds ratios (OR) for the associations between stumbling in men and age (OR: 1.98), mental burden (OR: 2.44), frequency of field work (OR: 1.74), seated stepping test count (OR: 0.95), and TMTB time (OR: 0.99). Significant ORs were found between falling in men and age (OR: 2.55), mental burden (OR: 2.40), exercise habits (OR: 2.55), and smoking (OR: 2.00). Significant ORs were found between stumbling in women and d_TUG (OR: 1.59) and mental burden (OR: 6.42). The study suggests that there may be an association between cognitive and physical decline and stumbling and falling in elderly workers.",

Many studies on VR-based rehabilitation systems are already underway. However, there are some issues such as the risk of falling or crashing due to the complete blockage of visual information, VR sickness, and lack of reality. The purpose of this research is to develop a system that simultaneously measures and evaluates multiple abilities and functions, such as motor function, cognitive function, and prediction ability, by using mixed reality (MR) smartglasses technology that enables interaction with spatially arranged objects while maintaining real-world information. In this study, we focused on the motor function of the upper limbs and cognitive function, and measured finger and gaze movements during a reaching task. In addition, we developed a game-based task for occupational therapy in a MR environment and reported the results.",

      "abstract": "Frailty is considered a multidimensional geriatric syndrome, manifested by the accumulation of age-associated deficits. The consequences of frailty transitions are still understudied. This study evaluated the influence of frailty transitions on cognitive function in the older adult population. We used data derived from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) (2008-2018) on older adults aged ≥ 65 years. Frailty was assessed using a validated Korean frailty measure known as the frailty instrument (FI), and cognitive function was measured using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Transitions in frailty and their relationship with cognitive function were investigated using lagged generalized estimating equations (GEE), t-tests, and ANOVA. Respondents who experienced frailty transitions (those with ameliorating frailty), those who developed frailty, and whose frailty remained constant, were more likely to have a lower cognitive function than those who were consistently non-frail. Older age, activities of daily living (ADL) disability, and instrumental ADL disability were more negatively associated with declining cognitive function, especially in the \"frail → frail\" group. Changes in all individual components of the frailty instrument were significantly associated with impaired cognitive function. The results suggest an association between frailty transitions and cognitive impairment. Over a 2-year span, the remaining frail individuals had the highest rate of cognitive decline in men, while the change from non-frail to frail state in women was significantly associated with the lowest cognitive function values. We recommend early interventions and prevention strategies in older adults to help ameliorate or slow down both frailty and cognitive function decline.",

Psychophysiology, cognitive function, and musculoskeletal status holistically explain tactical performance readiness and resilience. J Strength Cond Res 37(12): 2443-2456, 2023-This study aimed to advance the techniques used in quantifying holistic readiness and resilience within military personnel. Tactical performers, instructors, and applied human performance scientists designed a weeklong competition to reflect realistic operational demands, test specific underlying performance constructs, and elucidate how modernized assessments could drive programmatic action. By placing first in their installation's local preliminary competition, 34 active-duty Marines earned the opportunity to compete in a series of 7 intense events for the title of champion. All inferential statistics were set to a p ≤ 0.05 level of significance. Morning heart rate variability identified top from bottom quartile finishers before a single competition event. By day 3, morning countermovement jump force production (normalized reactive strength index-modified) and cognitive psychomotor vigilance were significant indicators of performance resilience and final competition group rank. Heart rate variability also tracked performer readiness across time, identifying within-group and between-group differences among top, bottom, and field. Collectively, these holistic assessments proved significant markers of acute and chronic tactical performance capabilities. In summary, the incorporation of psychophysiological monitoring, cognitive performance testing, and musculoskeletal force plate evaluations could help inform selection and support needs, drive workload or recovery modulation, and provide critical metrics for evaluating training efficacy and operational readiness. Defense organizations should consider routinely incorporating and actioning similar holistic status monitoring strategies in training and operational settings. Moreover, leveraging other tactical competitions may provide key opportunities for advancing the standard of practice through additional scientific investigation.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies indicate a potential link between oral health and cognitive function; however, long-term associations remain unclear. This study aimed to identify oral health factors that predict changes in cognitive function among older adults over time. The study included 583 independent older adults (201 male, 382 female) with a mean age of 72.7 years. Cognitive function was assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline and follow-up over two years, with relative change in MMSE (rMMSE) calculated. Baseline oral health variables included number of remaining teeth, masticatory performance, occlusal force, oral diadochokinesis and tongue pressure. Physical performance and confounding factors were also considered. The relationship between rMMSE and the variables was analyzed using Pearson's correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, and multiple linear regression analysis. Cognitive function declined in 196 subjects, with rMMSE significantly correlated with oral diadochokinesis. Regression analysis revealed significant associations between cognitive changes and oral diadochokinesis (p = 0.020) and knee extension strength as a physical performance (p = 0.047). Our findings suggest that cognitive decline may be indicated by declines in both physical and oral motor performance. Incorporating oral diadochokinesis testing into health screenings could aid early detection of cognitive decline, improving outcomes and reducing healthcare burdens.",

      "abstract": "The extent to which sleep is causally related to mental health is unclear. One way to test the causal link is to evaluate the extent to which interventions that improve sleep quality also improve mental health. We conducted a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials that reported the effects of an intervention that improved sleep on composite mental health, as well as on seven specific mental health difficulties. 65 trials comprising 72 interventions and N = 8608 participants were included. Improving sleep led to a significant medium-sized effect on composite mental health (g+ = -0.53), depression (g+ = -0.63), anxiety (g+ = -0.51), and rumination (g+ = -0.49), as well as significant small-to-medium sized effects on stress (g+ = -0.42), and finally small significant effects on positive psychosis symptoms (g+ = -0.26). We also found a dose response relationship, in that greater improvements in sleep quality led to greater improvements in mental health. Our findings suggest that sleep is causally related to the experience of mental health difficulties. Future research might consider how interventions that improve sleep could be incorporated into mental health services, as well as the mechanisms of action that explain how sleep exerts an effect on mental health.",

      "abstract": "When entering the university setting, poor sleep quality is reportedly prevalent among students and has been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including reduced academic performance. Moreover, determinants of sleep quality are not yet fully understood. This study was designed to (1) assess the prevalence of poor sleep quality and (2) identify determinants of sleep quality in German university students. In total, 1,684 undergraduate and graduate students (50.6% female, mean age 22.87 ± 3.15 years) from multiple academic disciplines completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing socio-demographic, health, and study-related indicators and sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). In our sample, 820 (48.7%) met the PSQI cut-off score (>5) for poor sleep quality. Multiple regression analysis showed that older age, being a business student, lower subjective social status, poorer self-rated health, stress, exhaustion, and poor academic performance significantly predicted poor sleep quality. Our findings document a high prevalence of poor sleep quality among university students and suggest that business students, especially, might be exposed to a greater risk for poor sleep quality. Furthermore, the results of this study are valuable for academic staff to develop tailored interventions to promote healthy sleep-in university students.",

      "abstract": "Standard polysomnographic analysis of sleep has not provided evidence of an objective measure of sleep quality; however, factors such as sleep duration and sleep efficiency are those more consistently associated with the subjective perception of sleep quality. Sleep reduction as currently occurs in our 24/7 society has had a profound impact on sleep quality; the habitual sleep period should fit within what is a limited nighttime window and may not be sufficient to satisfy the whole sleep process; moreover, the use of artificial light during the evening and early night hours can delay and disturb the circadian rhythms, especially affecting REM sleep. The correct phase relationship of the sleep period with the circadian pacemaker is an important factor to guarantee adequate restorative sleep duration and sleep continuity, thus providing the necessary background for a good night's sleep. Due to the fact that REM sleep is controlled by the circadian clock, it can provide a window-like mechanism that defines the termination of the sleep period when there is still the necessity to complete the sleep process (not only wake-related homeostasis) and to meet the circadian end of sleep timing. An adequate amount of REM sleep appears necessary to guarantee sleep continuity, while periodically activating the brain and preparing it for the return to consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the associations between adequate sleep, performance and health outcomes is vital, yet a major limitation in the design and interpretation of studies of sleep and performance is the variability of subjective and objective markers used to assess sleep quality. The aim of this scoping review is to investigate how various physiological signals recorded during sleep or wakefulness relate to objective measures of cognitive or physical performance and subjectively perceived sleep quality to inform conceptual understanding of the elusive, amorphous, and multi-dimensional construct of sleep quality. We also aimed to suggest priorities for future areas of research in sleep quality and performance. We searched six databases ultimately yielding 439 studies after duplicate removal. Sixty-five studies were selected for full review. In general, correlations between objectively measured sleep and objective performance or subjectively assessed sleep quality were weak to moderate. Slow wave sleep was moderately correlated with better performance on tasks of vigilance, motor speed, and executive function as well as better subjective sleep quality and feeling well-rested, suggesting that slow wave sleep may be important for sleep quality and optimal daytime performance. However, these findings were inconsistent across studies. Increased sleep fragmentation was associated with poorer subjective sleep quality in both polysomnographic and actigraphic studies. Studies which simultaneously assessed physiologic sleep measures, performance measures and subjective sleep perception were few, limiting the ability to evaluate correlations between subjective and objective outcomes concurrently in the same individuals. Factors influencing the relationship between sleep quality and performance include circadian variability, sleep inertia, and mismatch between sleep stages studied and outcome measures of choice. Ultimately, the determination of \"quality sleep\" remains largely subjective and inconsistently quantifiable by current measures. Methods evaluating sleep as a continuous measure rather than traditional sleep stages may provide an intriguing approach to future studies of sleep and performance. Future well-designed studies using novel measures of sleep or multimodal ambulatory wearables assessing the three domains of sleep and performance (objective sleep physiology, objective performance, and subjective sleep quality) are needed to better define quality sleep.",

Ashwagandha is an Ayurvedic herb that has been used historically to support healthy responses to stressors, but has recently gained popularity in the United States for its ability to support well-being for populations who experience chronic stress. To our knowledge, there have not been any human trials evaluating the efficacy of ashwagandha on stress in the United States. No studies to date have used qualitative research methods to consider the experiential impact of ashwagandha supplementation.

Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group (n = 104 each), and those in the intervention group practiced yoga for 20 weeks. The participants completed the following questionnaires: the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; Menopause Rating Scale; and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The results revealed that yoga effectively decreased menopausal symptoms, with the strongest effects noted in postmenopausal women (mean ± standard deviation: 14.98 ± 7.10), followed by perimenopausal women (6.11 ± 2.07). Yoga significantly improved sleep quality in postmenopausal and perimenopausal women after controlling for social support, depression, anxiety, stress, and menopausal symptoms (p < 0.001). However, yoga did not affect sleep quality in premenopausal women. Overall sleep quality significantly improved in postmenopausal and perimenopausal women. Our data indicate that yoga can help decrease menopausal symptoms, particularly in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, and improve their health.",

      "abstract": "Deteriorating sleep quality and physical or mental fatigue in older adults leads to decreased quality of life and increased mortality rates. This study investigated the effects of the time-dependent intake of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on sleep quality, fatigue, and physical performance in older adults. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluated 108 participants divided into four groups (NMN_AM; antemeridian, NMN_PM; post meridian, Placebo_AM, Placebo_PM). NMN (250 mg) or placebo was administered once a day for 12 weeks. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Fatigue was evaluated using the \"Jikaku-sho shirabe\" questionnaire. Grip strength, 5-times sit-to-stand (5-STS), timed up and go, and 5-m habitual walk were evaluated to assess the physical performance. Significant interactions were observed between 5-STS and drowsiness. 5-STS of all groups on post-intervention and drowsiness of the NMN_PM and Placebo_PM groups on mid- and post-intervention showed significant improvement compared with those in pre-intervention. The NMN_PM group demonstrated the largest effect size for 5-STS (d = 0.72) and drowsiness (d = 0.64). Overall, NMN intake in the afternoon effectively improved lower limb function and reduced drowsiness in older adults. These findings suggest the potential of NMN in preventing loss of physical performance and improving fatigue in older adults.",

      "abstract": "High-quality sleep is an important factor in sustaining health and improving well-being. Previous evidence has demonstrated the positive associations between increased physical activity and reduced sedentary behaviour (SB) with sleep quality. The substitutional relationships between SB, light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) need to be considered when examining how a particular behaviour may impact sleep quality. No studies, to our knowledge, have explored these substitutional relationships in middle-aged adulthood. Using an isotemporal substitution approach, this study examined the associations of replacing sedentary time with physical activity on sleep quality measures in a sample of middle-aged adults in Japan. Data from 683 adults aged 40-64 living in Japan were used. The average daily time spent in SB, LPA, and MVPA was objectively assessed by accelerometers. Two self-reported sleep quality measures were obtained using questionnaires, including rest by sleep and sleep quality. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the associations of SB, LPA, and MVPA with the sleep quality measures stratified by gender. We found that each 60 min unit of SB or LPA replaced with MVPA was favourably associated with rest by sleep among women (β = 0.16, 95% CI 0.07, 0.28, p < 0.001; β = 0.18, 95% CI 0.07, 0.32, p < 0.05, respectively). There were no significant associations between SB, LPA, and MVPA with sleep measures in men across all three models. These findings indicate that higher MVPA has a positive association with sleep quality in middle-aged women.",

Patients with cancer may experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) throughout the diagnostic process and even after diagnosis is completed, especially when facing the possibility of tumor recurrence. Survivors, in particular, are frequently in a condition of uncertainty due to the 15 to 20% chance of recurrence within 3 years of the main treatment. Despite the high rate of cancer survival, which is believed to be around 83%, assessing quality of life after a cancer diagnosis can help to improve such results.",

The aim of the study was to compare sleep quality and chronotype distribution between 84 highly trained alpine skiers and a control sample of 84 non-athletes matched by age and sex ratio. Quality of sleep was assessed by the Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index (PSQI), and chronotype was assessed by the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Additional questions assessed sleep management during training or competitions. The results showed a marked skewed chronotype distribution towards morningness in alpine skiers (52.4% morning type, 42.8% intermediate, and 4.8% evening type) in comparison to the control group. The midpoint of sleep was significantly anticipated among alpine skiers. Differently from the previous literature that showed poor sleep quality and quantity in competitive athletes, the quality and quantity of sleep in alpine skiers was within the normal range in all the PSQI subcomponents.",

      "abstract": "Burn survivors undergo a plethora of physiologic disturbances that can greatly affect the quality of life (QOL) and healing processes. This review aimed to systematically examine sleep quality among individuals with burns and to explore the effectiveness of interventions using a meta-analytic approach. A systematic review of the literature was conducted by searching for articles using various databases. Titles and abstracts were screened and full texts of retained articles were assessed based on eligibility criteria. Methodological quality was ascertained in all articles using various scales. Overall, 5323 articles were screened according to titles and abstracts and 25 articles were retained following full-text screening. Of the 25 articles, 17 were assessed qualitatively, while 8 were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the qualitative analysis, sleep was found to be negatively affected in patients with burn injuries. The subsample of eight articles included in the meta-analysis showed an overall weighted mean effect size (Hedges's g) of 1.04 (SE = 0.4, 95% CI, z = 3.0; P &lt; 0.01), indicating a large, positive effect of the intervention on sleep quality for patients with burn injuries. This review was able to demonstrate the detrimental effects of burn injury on sleep quality. Several interventions have been examined throughout the literature and have shown to be beneficial for sleep quality. However, there is great heterogeneity between existing interventions. The results from this review suggest that further research is needed before recommendations can be made as to which intervention is most effective at improving sleep in patients suffering from burn injuries.",

      "abstract": "Women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) are emotionally challenged. Anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances are common complaints. The impact of these symptoms on IVF outcome is however debated. In this study, we aimed at investigating whether sleep quality and psychological health can affect the chances of success of the procedure. Women undergoing IVF were recruited at the time of oocytes retrieval. Women's sleep quality and psychological health was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Baseline characteristics and results of the three scales were compared between women who did and did not succeed. Overall, 263 women were included, of whom 81 had a clinical pregnancy (31%). As expected, successful women were younger, and their ovarian reserve was more preserved. FPI and HADS scores did not differ. Conversely, a statistically significant difference emerged for the PSQI score, the median [interquartile range] in pregnant and non-pregnant women being 4 [3-5] and 5 [3-7], respectively (p = 0.004). The crude and adjusted OR of pregnancy in women with a PSQI > 5 (indicating impaired sleep quality) was 0.46 (95% CI 0.25-0.86, p = 0.02) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.26-0.94, p = 0.03), respectively. In conclusion, low sleep quality is common in women scheduled for IVF and could influence the success of the procedure.",

      "abstract": "While sleep positively impacts well-being, health, and productivity, the effects of societal factors on sleep remain underexplored. Here we analyze the sleep of 30,082 individuals across 11 countries using 52 million activity records from wearable devices. Our data are consistent with past studies of gender and age-associated sleep characteristics. However, our analysis of wearable device data uncovers differences in recorded vs. self-reported bedtime and sleep duration. The dataset allowed us to study how country-specific metrics such as GDP and cultural indices relate to sleep in groups and individuals. Our analysis indicates that diverse sleep metrics can be represented by two dimensions: sleep quantity and quality. We find that 55% of the variation in sleep quality, and 63% in sleep quantity, are explained by societal factors. Within a societal boundary, individual sleep experience was modified by factors like exercise. Increased exercise or daily steps were associated with better sleep quality (for example, faster sleep onset and less time awake in bed), especially in countries like the U.S. and Finland. Understanding how social norms relate to sleep will help create strategies and policies that enhance the positive impacts of sleep on health, such as productivity and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Sleep quality is considered to be an individual's self-satisfaction with all aspects of the sleep experience. Good sleep not only improves a person's physical, mental and daily functional health, but also improves the quality-of-life level to some extent. In contrast, chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic dysfunction and cognitive and emotional dysfunction, and can even lead to increased mortality. The scientific evaluation and monitoring of sleep quality is an important prerequisite for safeguarding and promoting the physiological health of the body. Therefore, we have compiled and reviewed the existing methods and emerging technologies commonly used for subjective and objective evaluation and monitoring of sleep quality, and found that subjective sleep evaluation is suitable for clinical screening and large-scale studies, while objective evaluation results are more intuitive and scientific, and in the comprehensive evaluation of sleep, if we want to get more scientific monitoring results, we should combine subjective and objective monitoring and dynamic monitoring.",

Also, persons with dementia may experience sleep-related stressors at night. Disruptive behavior and sleep of the care recipients may produce stress in the caregivers, which has been considered a precipitating factor for sleep issues among caregivers. This systematic review aims to examine the available literature to investigate depressive symptoms and sleep quality among informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Using PRISMA guidelines, only eight articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Sleep quality and depressive symptoms should be investigated because they may influence caregivers' health and their involvement in caregiving.",

Here, we report a pre-registered systematic review (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO], CRD42020158683) of studies examining the association between tactile intimacy and sleep quality in healthy adults. The databases PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and EMBASE were searched on August 7, 2020. A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria and were synthesised qualitatively. Most commonly, articles researched sexual intimacy in relation to sleep quality, but some studies also investigated non-sexual affective touch and emotionally neutral touch. Some evidence for a connection between sexual function, sexual satisfaction and masturbation with sleep quality was found; however, no evidence for an association between sexual frequency or sexual positions and sleep was found. Interestingly, studies employing more subjective approaches were more likely to report an association between touch and sleep, potentially highlighting a discrepancy between self-reported and the objectively measurable association between touch and sleep.",

      "abstract": "The consumption of caffeine in response to insufficient sleep may impair the onset and maintenance of subsequent sleep. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effect of caffeine on the characteristics of night-time sleep, with the intent to identify the time after which caffeine should not be consumed prior to bedtime. A systematic search of the literature was undertaken with 24 studies included in the analysis. Caffeine consumption reduced total sleep time by 45 min and sleep efficiency by 7%, with an increase in sleep onset latency of 9 min and wake after sleep onset of 12 min. Duration (+6.1 min) and proportion (+1.7%) of light sleep (N1) increased with caffeine intake and the duration (-11.4 min) and proportion (-1.4%) of deep sleep (N3 and N4) decreased with caffeine intake. To avoid reductions in total sleep time, coffee (107 mg per 250 mL) should be consumed at least 8.8 h prior to bedtime and a standard serve of pre-workout supplement (217.5 mg) should be consumed at least 13.2 h prior to bedtime. The results of the present study provide evidence-based guidance for the appropriate consumption of caffeine to mitigate the deleterious effects on sleep.",

      "abstract": "Consuming coffee, a widely enjoyed beverage with caffeine, can impact the central nervous system and disturb sleep if taken too close to bedtime. Caffeine impacts sleep by slowing the onset, blocking adenosine receptors, lowering deep sleep levels, disrupting sleep patterns, and lessening rapid eye movement sleep. Although coffee can help with alertness in the morning, it may disturb sleep in the evening, particularly for individuals who are sensitive to caffeine. To enhance the quality of sleep, reduce the consumption of caffeine in the afternoon and evening, refrain from drinking caffeine before going to bed, and choose decaffeinated drinks instead. Variables such as personal reactions, ability to handle caffeine, and engagement with other compounds also influence the impact of coffee on sleep. Keeping track of how much caffeine you consume and your sleeping habits can assist in recognizing any disturbances and making needed changes. Furthermore, taking into account variables such as metabolism, age, and the timing of coffee consumption can assist in lessening the effects of coffee on sleep. In general, paying attention to the amount of caffeine consumed from different sources and consuming it at the right times can assist in preserving healthy sleep patterns even while enjoying coffee.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide, approximately one in three people are myopic or short-sighted. Myopia in children is of particular concern as younger onset age implies a higher risk of progression, and consequently greater risk of developing vision-threatening complications. The importance of sleep in children's health has long been acknowledged, but evidence for its role in childhood myopia is fairly new and mixed results were presented across studies. To facilitate better understanding of this relationship, a broad literature search, up to and including October 31, 2022, was performed using three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus). Seventeen studies were included in the review, covering four main aspects of sleep, namely duration, quality, timing, and efficiency, and their associations with myopia in children. The present literature review discussed these studies, revealed potential limitations in their methodologies, and identified gaps that need to be addressed in the future. The review also acknowledges that current evidence is insufficient, and the role of sleep in childhood myopia is far from being fully understood. Future studies that primarily, objectively, and accurately assess sleep and myopia, taking other characteristics of sleep beyond duration into consideration, with a more diverse sample in terms of age, ethnicity, and cultural/environmental background, and control for confounders such as light exposure and education load are much needed. Although more research is required, myopia management should be a holistic approach and the inclusion of sleep hygiene in myopia education targeting children and parents ought to be encouraged.",

By contrast, the sleep-onset period (SOP), often portrayed as a mere prelude to sleep, has been largely overlooked and remains poorly characterized. Recent findings, however, have reignited interest in this transitional period and have shed light on its neural mechanisms, cognitive dynamics, and clinical implications. This review synthesizes the existing knowledge about the SOP in humans. We first examine the current definition of the SOP and its limits, and consider the dynamic and complex electrophysiological changes that accompany the descent to sleep. We then describe the interplay between internal and external processing during the wake-to-sleep transition. Finally, we discuss the putative cognitive benefits of the SOP and identify novel directions to better diagnose sleep-onset disorders.",

      "abstract": "Public health guidelines recommend exercise as a key lifestyle intervention for promoting and maintaining healthy sleep function and reducing disease risk. However, strenuous evening exercise may disrupt sleep due to heightened sympathetic arousal. This study examines the association between strenuous evening exercise and objective sleep, using data from 14,689 physically active individuals who wore a biometric device during a one-year study interval (4,084,354 person-nights). Here we show later exercise timing and higher exercise strain are associated with delayed sleep onset, shorter sleep duration, lower sleep quality, higher nocturnal resting heart rate, and lower nocturnal heart rate variability. Regardless of strain, exercise bouts ending ≥4 hours before sleep onset are not associated with changes in sleep. Our results suggest evening exercise-particularly involving high exercise strain-may disrupt subsequent sleep and nocturnal autonomic function. Individuals aiming to improve sleep health may benefit from concluding exercise at least 4 hours before sleep onset or electing lighter strain exercises within this window.",

After 4 weeks of consuming 2.7 g of matcha daily (containing 50.3 mg theanine, 301.4 mg catechins, and 71.5 mg caffeine), no significant differences were observed between the control and matcha groups on total sleep time, sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, or sleep efficiency measured by electroencephalography (EEG). However, the sleep questionnaire Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi Sleep Inventory, the Middle-age and Aged version (OSA-MA), administered immediately after waking showed a trend toward increased satisfaction with sleep time (",

      "abstract": "Early onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) has been recently defined as a clinical entity with subjects presenting with Parkinson's disease (PD) between the ages of 21-50 and replaces the term Young Onset PD (YOPD). Presentations in this age group are somewhat different to the typical Late Onset sporadic PD (LOPD) and genetic basis may play an important role. The presentations are however, to be differentiated from other causes of juvenile onset or early onset parkinsonism, which are often driven by rare genetic, brain metal deposition, or metabolic progressive disorders with a levolevodopa unresponsive or poorly responsive phenotype. Specific genetic mutations can also underpin EOPD and include nonmotor symptoms of EOPD, which have not been studied extensively. However, some real-life comparator studies with LOPD suggest a nonmotor profile in EOPD dominated by neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety), pain, sexual dysfunction, and a higher risk of impulse control disorders and segregation to the recently described noradrenergic and Park-sleep nonmotor endophenotypes may occur. Awareness of the phenotypic variants and nonmotor expression will pave the way for future precision and personalised medicine.",

      "abstract": "The transition from wakefulness to sleep is a progressive process that is reflected in the gradual loss of responsiveness, an alteration of cognitive functions, and a drastic shift in brain dynamics. These changes do not occur all at once. The sleep onset period (SOP) refers here to this period of transition between wakefulness and sleep. For example, although transitions of brain activity at sleep onset can occur within seconds in a given brain region, these changes occur at different time points across the brain, resulting in a SOP that can last several minutes. Likewise, the transition to sleep impacts cognitive and behavioral levels in a graded and staged fashion. It is often accompanied and preceded by a sensation of drowsiness and the subjective feeling of a need for sleep, also associated with specific physiological and behavioral signatures. To better characterize fluctuations in vigilance and the SOP, a multidimensional approach is thus warranted. Such a multidimensional approach could mitigate important limitations in the current classification of sleep, leading ultimately to better diagnoses and treatments of individuals with sleep and/or vigilance disorders. These insights could also be translated in real-life settings to either facilitate sleep onset in individuals with sleep difficulties or, on the contrary, prevent or control inappropriate sleep onsets.",

      "title": "Reconsidering sleep perception in insomnia: from misperception to mismeasurement.",
      "abstract": "So-called 'sleep misperception' refers to a phenomenon in which individuals have the impression of sleeping little or not at all despite normal objective measures of sleep. It is unknown whether this subjective-objective mismatch truly reflects an abnormal perception of sleep, or whether it results from the inability of standard sleep recording techniques to capture 'wake-like' brain activity patterns that could account for feeling awake during sleep. Here, we systematically reviewed studies reporting sleep macro- and microstructural, metabolic, and mental correlates of sleep (mis)perception. Our findings suggest that most individuals tend to accurately estimate their sleep duration measured with polysomnography (PSG). In good sleepers, feeling awake during sleep is the rule at sleep onset, remains frequent in the first non-rapid eye movement sleep cycle and almost never occurs in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In contrast, there are patients with insomnia who consistently underestimate their sleep duration, regardless of how long they sleep. Unlike good sleepers, they continue to feel awake after the first sleep cycle and importantly, during REM sleep. Their mental activity during sleep is also more thought-like. Initial studies based on standard PSG parameters largely failed to show consistent differences in sleep macrostructure between these patients and controls. However, recent studies assessing sleep with more refined techniques have revealed that these patients show metabolic and microstructural electroencephalography changes that likely reflect a shift towards greater cortical activation during sleep and correlate with feeling awake. We discuss the significance of these correlates and conclude with open questions and possible ways to address them.",

      "abstract": "The link between dreams and creativity has been a topic of intense speculation. Recent scientific findings suggest that sleep onset (known as N1) may be an ideal brain state for creative ideation. However, the specific link between N1 dream content and creativity has remained unclear. To investigate the contribution of N1 dream content to creative performance, we administered targeted dream incubation (a protocol that presents auditory cues at sleep onset to introduce specific themes into dreams) and collected dream reports to measure incorporation of the selected theme into dream content. We then assessed creative performance using a set of three theme-related creativity tasks. Our findings show enhanced creative performance and greater semantic distance in task responses following a period of N1 sleep as compared to wake, corroborating recent work identifying N1 as a creative sweet spot and offering novel evidence for N1 enabling a cognitive state with greater associative divergence. We further demonstrate that successful N1 dream incubation enhances creative performance more than N1 sleep alone. To our knowledge, this is the first controlled experiment investigating a direct role of incubating dream content in the enhancement of creative performance.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient sleep is a growing global problem, with poor sleep associated with many negative health and performance outcomes. Previous reviews investigating the effect of diet on sleep have highlighted the amino acid tryptophan as a promising sleep-promoting nutrient, with the richest food source of tryptophan, ⍺-lactalbumin, requiring further investigation. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to review the existing evidence of association between ⍺-lactalbumin and sleep. Four electronic databases (CINAHL Complete, Embase, MEDLINE Complete, and SPORTDiscus with Full Text) were searched from database inception to March 2023, with primary research articles included if they contained α-lactalbumin as an independent variable, an outcome measure of sleep or sleepiness, and participants were ≥ 18 years old. Eight studies were reviewed, with four studies recruiting athletic populations (50%) and four recruiting healthy participants (50%). Sleep or sleepiness was measured objectively in six studies (75%), with two studies employing polysomnography and four utilizing actigraphy to assess sleep. Across the studies, 20-60 g of ⍺-lactalbumin was supplemented, with five studies (63%) observing a positive association between α-lactalbumin and sleep. Sleep-onset latency was the primary sleep metric improved following evening supplementation of α-lactalbumin (≤ 3.5 hr pre-sleep), with no studies observing any negative associations with sleep. Data from this review suggest that individuals that have difficulty initiating sleep may benefit most from pre-sleep α-lactalbumin supplementation. Further research is required to establish the effect that α-lactalbumin has on sleep architecture, through the use of more comprehensive sleep analysis tools such as portable electroencephalography or polysomnography, in combination with stringent dietary controls.",

      "abstract": "During acute hospitalization, many caregivers decide to stay at the care recipient's bedside over the course of several days or months, coping with a stressful situation and a poor sleeping environment. Our objective was to characterize caregiver sleep-wake cycles during care recipient hospital admission and test the association between sleep location (home versus hospital) and caregiver sleep. Eighty-six informal caregivers (78.8% female; age 55.47 ± 12.43 years) were recruited. For seven consecutive days, caregivers wore actigraphy devices and filled a sleep diary indicating whether they had slept at the hospital or at home. Caregiver insomnia symptoms, anxiety, and depression along with patient dependence were also assessed. Nighttime total sleep time, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and fragmentation index were described. Mixed-model analyses were used to evaluate the effect of the overnight location (home versus hospital) on caregiver sleep quality. In total, 38.4% of caregivers exhibited poor objective sleep efficiencies (< 80%), and 43% of caregivers reported having moderate to severe insomnia symptoms. Caregivers mostly slept at the hospital (",

      "abstract": "Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often report disrupted and unrefreshing sleep in association with worsened fatigue symptoms. However, the nature and magnitude of sleep architecture alteration in ME/CFS is not known, with studies using objective sleep measures in ME/CFS generating contradictory results. The current manuscript aimed to review and meta-analyse of case-control studies with objective sleep measures in ME/CSF. A search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar, and Psychoinfo databases. After review, 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 20 studies with 801 adults (ME/CFS = 426; controls = 375), and 4 studies with 477 adolescents (ME/CFS = 242; controls = 235), who underwent objective measurement of sleep. Adult ME/CFS patients spend longer time in bed, longer sleep onset latency, longer awake time after sleep onset, reduced sleep efficiency, decreased stage 2 sleep, more Stage 3, and longer rapid eye movement sleep latency. However, adolescent ME/CFS patients had longer time in bed, longer total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and reduced sleep efficiency. The meta-analysis results demonstrate that sleep is altered in ME/CFS, with changes seeming to differ between adolescent and adults, and suggesting sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system alterations in ME/CFS.",

Here we analyze the sleep of 30,082 individuals across 11 countries using 52 million activity records from wearable devices. Our data are consistent with past studies of gender and age-associated sleep characteristics. However, our analysis of wearable device data uncovers differences in recorded vs. self-reported bedtime and sleep duration. The dataset allowed us to study how country-specific metrics such as GDP and cultural indices relate to sleep in groups and individuals. Our analysis indicates that diverse sleep metrics can be represented by two dimensions: sleep quantity and quality. We find that 55% of the variation in sleep quality, and 63% in sleep quantity, are explained by societal factors. Within a societal boundary, individual sleep experience was modified by factors like exercise. Increased exercise or daily steps were associated with better sleep quality (for example, faster sleep onset and less time awake in bed), especially in countries like the U.S. and Finland. Understanding how social norms relate to sleep will help create strategies and policies that enhance the positive impacts of sleep on health, such as productivity and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Excessive screen exposure has become a significant health concern. This study investigates the impact of screen time on aging in middle-aged and elderly populations. Healthy working adults over 45 years old in Shanghai, China, underwent general and ocular examinations. Questionnaires collected demographics, medical history, and screen exposure details. Aging was assessed using the retinal age gap, defined as the difference between the retinal age predicted by deep learning algorithms based on fundus images and chronological age. Pathway analysis tested the mediation effect of sleep duration and onset time on the relationship between screen usage and retinal age gap. The retinal age gap increased with longer screen exposure, from 0.49 ± 3.51 years in the lowest tertile to 5.13 ± 4.96 years in the highest tertile (Jonckheere-Terpstra test, p < 0.001). Each additional hour of screen exposure accelerated the retinal age gap by 0.087 years (95% CI, 0.027, 0.148, p = 0.005) in the fully adjusted linear model. Sleep onset time mediated the impact of screen usage on the retinal age gap (indirect effect, β = 0.11; 95% CI 0.04-0.24). The impact of screen usage in a light-off environment on the retinal age gap was fully mediated by sleep onset time (indirect effect, β = 0.22; 95% CI 0.07-0.38), with the proportion being 100%. Our study identified a correlation between excessive screen time and a wider retinal age gap in middle-aged and elderly individuals, likely due to delayed sleep onset. To mitigate the adverse effects on the retina and aging, it is important to limit screen usage and avoid screens before bedtime.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances and first onset of major mental disorders in adolescence and early adulthood: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
      "abstract": "Despite several high-quality reviews of insomnia and incidence of mental disorders, prospective longitudinal relationships between a wider range of sleep disturbances and first onset of a depressive, bipolar, or psychotic disorders during the peak age range for onset of these conditions has not been addressed. Database searches were undertaken to identify publications on insomnia, but also on other sleep problems such as hypersomnia, short sleep duration, self-identified and/or generic 'sleep problems' and circadian sleep-wake cycle dysrhythmias. We discovered 36 studies that were eligible for systematic review and from these publications, we identified 25 unique datasets that were suitable for meta-analysis (Number>45,000; age ∼17). Individuals with a history of any type of sleep disturbance (however defined) had an increased odds of developing a mood or psychotic disorder in adolescence or early adulthood (Odds ratio [OR]:1.88; 95% Confidence Intervals:1.67, 2.25) with similar odds for onset of bipolar disorders (OR:1.72) or depressive disorders (OR:1.62). The magnitude of associations differed according to type of exposure and was greatest for sleep disturbances that met established diagnostic criteria for a sleep disorder (OR: 2.53). However, studies that examined observer or self-rated symptoms, also reported a significant association between hypersomnia symptoms and the onset of a major mental disorder (OR:1.39). Overall study quality was moderate with evidence of publication bias and meta-regression identified confounders such as year of publication. We conclude that evidence indicates that subjective, observer and objective studies demonstrate a modest but significant increase in the likelihood of first onset of mood and psychotic disorders in adolescence and early adulthood in individuals with broadly defined sleep disturbances. Although findings support proposals for interventions for sleep problems in youth, we suggest a need for greater consensus on screening strategies and for more longitudinal, prospective studies of circadian sleep-wake cycle dysrhythmias in youth.",

We present a case of an adolescent female with excessive daytime sleepiness and \"sleep attacks\" who was evaluated using a 2-week sleep log, wrist actigraphy, baseline polysomnogram, and Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Multiple Sleep Latency Test results noted a short mean sleep latency without sleep onset rapid eye movement periods, concerning for possible central disorders of hypersomnolence. However, actigraphy data noted a habitual bedtime of midnight or later, resulting in less than recommended total sleep time for her age on weekdays with extended sleep periods on the weekends. The most unique actigraphy finding was exposure to ambient light throughout most overnight sleep periods. When actigraphy results were discussed with the patient, she revealed recent onset of severe anxiety with fear of sleeping in the dark. This case highlights the importance of thorough clinical evaluation, and careful interpretation of objective tests, when evaluating for causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.",

      "abstract": "Studies have linked frailty to sleep duration and/or quality using questionnaire-based subjective sleep assessments. This study clarified the relationship between frailty status and subjective and objective sleep indicators among community-dwelling older adults in a rural Japanese area. This cross-sectional cohort study analyzed the data of older adult participants in the FESTA Study, assessing subjective and objective sleep indicators using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and an actigraph, respectively. Frailty status was determined using the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) and the Kihon Checklist (KCL). Its relationship was examined through multivariate logistic regression analysis. The data of 537 older adults (median age = 76 years; 177 men and 360 women) were analyzed. Aside from age, depression, and dietary variety score, the PSQI score and the number of awakening episodes after sleep onset were significantly associated with non-robustness when the J-CHS was utilized (OR 1.086 95%CI 1.017-1.159 P = .014 and OR .964 95%CI .934-.994 P = .019, respectively). When the KCL was utilized, non-robustness was significantly associated with the PSQI score (OR 1.100 95%CI 1.028-1.178 P = .006), along with age, gender, number of comorbidities, and depression. Among the seven items of the PSQI, non-robustness was significantly related to daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness. The associations between non-robustness and objective sleep indicators varied by the frailty assessment method, while non-robustness was significantly associated with subjective sleep quality, regardless of the diagnostic tool used for frailty status and age. Therefore, subjective sleep quality may be more reliable for preventing and/or managing frailty in older adults.",

      "abstract": "To evaluate sleep quality, it is necessary to monitor overnight sleep duration. However, sleep monitoring typically requires more than 7 hours, which can be inefficient in termxs of data size and analysis. Therefore, we proposed to develop a deep learning-based model using a 30 sec sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) early in the sleep cycle to predict sleep onset latency (SOL) distribution and explore associations with sleep quality (SQ). We propose a deep learning model composed of a structure that decomposes and restores the signal in epoch units and a structure that predicts the SOL distribution. We used the Sleep Heart Health Study public dataset, which includes a large number of study subjects, to estimate and evaluate the proposed model. The proposed model estimated the SOL distribution and divided it into four clusters. The advantage of the proposed model is that it shows the process of falling asleep for individual participants as a probability graph over time. Furthermore, we compared the baseline of good SQ and SOL and showed that less than 10 minutes SOL correlated better with good SQ. Moreover, it was the most suitable sleep feature that could be predicted using early EEG, compared with the total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and actual sleep time. Our study showed the feasibility of estimating SOL distribution using deep learning with an early EEG and showed that SOL distribution within 10 minutes was associated with good SQ.",

      "abstract": "Multiple studies have examined associations between sleep and cognition in older adults, but a majority of these depend on self-reports on sleep and utilize cognitive tests that assess overall cognitive function. The current meta-analysis involved 72 independent studies and sought to quantify associations between objectively measured sleep parameters and cognitive performance in healthy older adults. Both sleep macrostructure (e.g., sleep duration, continuity, and stages) and microstructure (e.g., slow wave activity and spindle activity) were evaluated. For macrostructure, lower restlessness at night was associated with better memory performance (r = 0.43, p = 0.02), while lower sleep onset latency was associated with better executive functioning (r = 0.28, p = 0.03). Greater relative amount of N2 and REM sleep, but not N3, positively correlated with cognitive performance. The association between microstructure and cognition in older adults was marginally significant. This relationship was moderated by age (z = 0.07, p < 0.01), education (z = 0.26, p = 0.03), and percentage of female participants (z = 0.01, p < 0.01). The current meta-analysis emphasizes the importance of considering objective sleep measures to understand the relationship between sleep and cognition in healthy older adults. These results also form a base from which researchers using wearable sleep technology and measuring behavior through computerized testing tools can evaluate their findings.",

      "abstract": "Although long-term memory consolidation is supported by sleep, it is unclear how it differs from that during wakefulness. Our review, focusing on recent advances in the field, identifies the repeated replay of neuronal firing patterns as a basic mechanism triggering consolidation during sleep and wakefulness. During sleep, memory replay occurs during slow-wave sleep (SWS) in hippocampal assemblies together with ripples, thalamic spindles, neocortical slow oscillations, and noradrenergic activity. Here, hippocampal replay likely favors the transformation of hippocampus-dependent episodic memory into schema-like neocortical memory. REM sleep following SWS might balance local synaptic rescaling accompanying memory transformation with a sleep-dependent homeostatic process of global synaptic renormalization. Sleep-dependent memory transformation is intensified during early development despite the immaturity of the hippocampus. Overall, beyond its greater efficacy, sleep consolidation differs from wake consolidation mainly in that it is supported, rather than impaired, by spontaneous hippocampal replay activity possibly gating memory formation in neocortex.",

We address how hypothalamic circuits involved in opposing behaviors such as core body temperature and sleep compute conflicting information and provide a coherent vigilance state.

      "abstract": "Sleep improves cognitive performance, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms of this improvement. We performed multielectrode recording in macaque visual and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while animals performed a visual discrimination task before and after non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Although sleep induces synchronized fluctuations in population activity across cortical areas, the post-sleep population activity became more desynchronized relative to the pre-sleep state. The changes after sleep were correlated with an increase in information encoded in population activity in each area and improved behavioral performance. Electrically stimulating visual cortex at 4 hertz emulated the beneficial effects of sleep on network and perceptual performance. A large-scale neural network model indicated that asymmetric depression of local intracortical synapses is consistent with the observed changes in neural activity after sleep.",

      "title": "Treatment of insomnia - effect of trazodone and hypnotics on sleep.",
      "abstract": "Sedative antidepressants are commonly used drugs in the treatment of insomnia. However, some recommendations claim that only hypnotics have been proven effective in the treatment of sleep initiation and maintenance disorders. The aim of this article is to compare the effect of hypnotics and trazodone on sleep, and to analyse the evidence for the use of trazodone in the treatment of insomnia. Three studies investigated the effects of trazodone on sleep in primary insomnia, 5 studies on insomnia in the course of affective disorders and 6 studies on insomnia in other indications (PTSD, Alzheimer's disease, alcohol and opiate dependence, somatoform disorder, and insomnia during pregnancy). In the treatment of insomnia, trazodone is less effective than hypnotics in the treatment of sleep onset insomnia (i.e., disorders of falling asleep). For this indication it needs to be administered earlier than hypnotics, at least 1 hour before bedtime. It is, however, very effective in the treatment of sleep-maintenance insomnia, especially in patients with comorbid mental disorders or patients treated with activating antidepressants. Hypnotics and trazodone have the opposite effect on deep sleep. Trazodone increases the duration of deep sleep, which is associated with better sleep quality as assessed by patients. In contrast, hypnotics decrease slow-wave activityin sleep EEG, which is the biomarker of deep sleep. The main mechanism through which trazodone promotes sleep is its antagonistic effect on 5-HT2 serotonin receptors, while hypnotics are agonists of gamma-aminobutyric acid GABAA receptors, and other sedative antidepressants block H1 histamine receptors. This is associated with a low risk of weight gain, which is rare with trazodone treatment.",

      "abstract": "Prolonged wakefulness leads to persistent, deep recovery sleep (RS). However, the neuronal circuits that mediate this process remain elusive. From a circuit screen in mice, we identified a group of thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) neurons activated during sleep deprivation (SD) and required for sleep homeostasis. Optogenetic activation of RE neurons leads to an unusual phenotype: presleep behaviors (grooming and nest organizing) followed by prolonged, intense sleep that resembles RS. Inhibiting RE activity during SD impairs subsequent RS, which suggests that these neurons signal sleep need. RE neurons act upstream of sleep-promoting zona incerta cells, and SD triggers plasticity of this circuit to strengthen their connectivity. These findings reveal a circuit mechanism by which sleep need transforms the functional coupling of a sleep circuit to promote persistent, deep sleep.",

      "abstract": "Poor sleep is associated with the risk of developing chronic pain, but how sleep contributes to pain chronicity remains unclear. Here we show that following peripheral nerve injury, cholinergic neurons in the anterior nucleus basalis (aNB) of the basal forebrain are increasingly active during nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. These neurons directly activate vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), causing disinhibition of pyramidal neurons and allodynia. The hyperactivity of aNB neurons is caused by the increased inputs from the parabrachial nucleus (PB) driven by the injured peripheral afferents. Inhibition of this pathway during NREM sleep, but not wakefulness, corrects neuronal hyperactivation and alleviates pain. Our results reveal that the PB-aNB-S1 pathway during sleep is critical for the generation and maintenance of chronic pain. Inhibiting this pathway during the sleep phase could be important for treating neuropathic pain.",

We argue that the relation is bi-directional and review evidence showing that sleep/alertness disturbance affects all phases of the addiction cycle, including the initiation, maintenance and relapse of SUD.

      "abstract": "The noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) regulates arousal levels during wakefulness, but its role in sleep remains unclear. Here, we show in mice that fluctuating LC neuronal activity partitions non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) into two brain-autonomic states that govern the NREMS-REMS cycle over ~50-s periods; high LC activity induces a subcortical-autonomic arousal state that facilitates cortical microarousals, whereas low LC activity is required for NREMS-to-REMS transitions. This functional alternation regulates the duration of the NREMS-REMS cycle by setting permissive windows for REMS entries during undisturbed sleep while limiting these entries to maximally one per ~50-s period during REMS restriction. A stimulus-enriched, stress-promoting wakefulness was associated with longer and shorter levels of high and low LC activity, respectively, during subsequent NREMS, resulting in more microarousal-induced NREMS fragmentation and delayed REMS onset. We conclude that LC activity fluctuations are gatekeepers of the NREMS-REMS cycle and that this role is influenced by adverse wake experiences.",

      "abstract": "Sleep can be distinguished from wake by changes in brain electrical activity, typically assessed using electroencephalography (EEG). The hallmark of nonrapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep is the shift from high-frequency, low-amplitude wake EEG to low-frequency, high-amplitude sleep EEG dominated by spindles and slow waves. Here we identified signatures of sleep in brain hemodynamic activity, using simultaneous functional MRI (fMRI) and EEG. We found that, at the transition from wake to sleep, fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activity evolved from a mixed-frequency pattern to one dominated by two distinct oscillations: a low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) oscillation prominent in light sleep and correlated with the occurrence of spindles, and a high-frequency oscillation (>0.1 Hz) prominent in deep sleep and correlated with the occurrence of slow waves. The two oscillations were both detectable across the brain but exhibited distinct spatiotemporal patterns. During the falling-asleep process, the low-frequency oscillation first appeared in the thalamus, then the posterior cortex, and lastly the frontal cortex, while the high-frequency oscillation first appeared in the midbrain, then the frontal cortex, and lastly the posterior cortex. During the waking-up process, both oscillations disappeared first from the thalamus, then the frontal cortex, and lastly the posterior cortex. The BOLD oscillations provide local signatures of spindle and slow wave activity. They may be employed to monitor the regional occurrence of sleep or wakefulness, track which regions are the first to fall asleep or wake up at the wake-sleep transitions, and investigate local homeostatic sleep processes.",

In addition to being a symptom of neurodegeneration, sleep disturbances may also contribute to disease progression. Currently, limited options exist to modulate sleep disturbances in PD. Studying the neurophysiological changes that affect sleep in PD at the cortical and subcortical level may yield new insights into mechanisms for reversal of sleep disruption. In this article, we review cortical and subcortical recording studies of sleep in PD with a particular focus on dissecting reported electrophysiological changes. These studies show that slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are both notably disrupted in PD. We further explore the impact of these electrophysiological changes and discuss the potential for targeting sleep via stimulation therapy to modify PD-related motor and nonmotor symptoms. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",

      "abstract": "Synaptic mechanisms that contribute to human memory consolidation remain largely unexplored. Consolidation critically relies on sleep. During slow wave sleep, neurons exhibit characteristic membrane potential oscillations known as UP and DOWN states. Coupling of memory reactivation to these slow oscillations promotes consolidation, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed axonal and multineuron patch-clamp recordings in acute human brain slices, obtained from neurosurgeries, to show that sleep-like UP and DOWN states modulate axonal action potentials and temporarily enhance synaptic transmission between neocortical pyramidal neurons. Synaptic enhancement by UP and DOWN state sequences facilitates recruitment of postsynaptic action potentials, which in turn results in long-term stabilization of synaptic strength. In contrast, synapses undergo lasting depression if presynaptic neurons fail to recruit postsynaptic action potentials. Our study offers a mechanistic explanation for how coupling of neural activity to slow waves can cause synaptic consolidation, with potential implications for brain stimulation strategies targeting memory performance.",

      "abstract": "Brain states (wake, sleep, general anesthesia, etc.) are profoundly associated with the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain oscillations. Previous studies showed that the EEG alpha power shifted from the occipital cortex to the frontal cortex (alpha anteriorization) after being induced into a state of general anesthesia via propofol. The sleep research literature suggests that slow waves and sleep spindles are generated locally and propagated gradually to different brain regions. Since sleep and general anesthesia are conceptualized under the same framework of consciousness, the present study examines whether alpha anteriorization similarly occurs during sleep and how the EEG power in other frequency bands changes during different sleep stages. The results from the analysis of three polysomnography datasets of 234 participants show consistent alpha anteriorization during the sleep stages N2 and N3, beta anteriorization during stage REM, and theta posteriorization during stages N2 and N3. Although it is known that the neural circuits responsible for sleep are not exactly the same for general anesthesia, the findings of alpha anteriorization in this study suggest that, at macro level, the circuits for alpha oscillations are organized in the similar cortical areas. The spatial shifts of EEG power in different frequency bands during sleep may offer meaningful neurophysiological markers for the level of consciousness.",

      "title": "Slow-wave sleep drives sleep-dependent renormalization of synaptic AMPA receptor levels in the hypothalamus.",
      "abstract": "According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY), sleep serves to renormalize synaptic connections that have been potentiated during the prior wake phase due to ongoing encoding of information. SHY focuses on glutamatergic synaptic strength and has been supported by numerous studies examining synaptic structure and function in neocortical and hippocampal networks. However, it is unknown whether synaptic down-regulation during sleep occurs in the hypothalamus, i.e., a pivotal center of homeostatic regulation of bodily functions including sleep itself. We show that sleep, in parallel with the synaptic down-regulation in neocortical networks, down-regulates the levels of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the hypothalamus of rats. Most robust decreases after sleep were observed at both sites for AMPARs containing the GluA1 subunit. Comparing the effects of selective rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and total sleep deprivation, we moreover provide experimental evidence that slow-wave sleep (SWS) is the driving force of the down-regulation of AMPARs in hypothalamus and neocortex, with no additional contributions of REM sleep or the circadian rhythm. SWS-dependent synaptic down-regulation was not linked to EEG slow-wave activity. However, spindle density during SWS predicted relatively increased GluA1 subunit levels in hypothalamic synapses, which is consistent with the role of spindles in the consolidation of memory. Our findings identify SWS as the main driver of the renormalization of synaptic strength during sleep and suggest that SWS-dependent synaptic renormalization is also implicated in homeostatic control processes in the hypothalamus.",

      "title": "A Customized Deep Sleep Recommender System Using Hybrid Deep Learning.",
      "abstract": "This paper proposes a recommendation system based on a hybrid learning approach for a personal deep sleep service, called the Customized Deep Sleep Recommender System (CDSRS). Sleep is one of the most important factors for human life in modern society. Optimal sleep contributes to increasing work efficiency and controlling overall well-being. Therefore, a sleep recommendation service is considered a necessary service for modern individuals. Accurate sleep analysis and data are required to provide such a personalized sleep service. However, given the variations in sleep patterns between individuals, there is currently no international standard for sleep. Additionally, service platforms face a cold start problem when dealing with new users. To address these challenges, this study utilizes K-means clustering analysis to define sleep patterns and employs a hybrid learning algorithm to evaluate recommendations by combining user-based and collaborative filtering methods. It also incorporates feedback top-N classification processing for user profile learning and recommendations. The behavior of the study model is as follows. Using personal information received through mobile devices and data, such as snoring, sleep time, movement, and noise collected through AI motion beds, we recommend sleep and receive user evaluations of recommended sleep. This assessment reconstructs the profile and, finally, makes recommendations using top-N classification. The experimental results were evaluated using two absolute error measurement methods: mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The research results regarding the hybrid learning methods show 13.2% fewer errors than collaborative filtering (CF) and 10.2% fewer errors than content-based filtering (CBF) on an MSE basis. According to the MAPE, the methods are 14.7% more accurate than the CF model and 9.2% better than the CBF model. These results demonstrate that CDSRS systems can provide more accurate recommendations and customized sleep services to users than CF, CBF, and combination models. As a result, CDSRS, a hybrid learning method, can better reflect a user's evaluation than traditional methods and can increase the accuracy of recommendations as the number of users increases.",

      "abstract": "During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, newly consolidated memories can be distorted to adjust the existing memory base in memory integration. However, only a few studies have demonstrated the role of REM sleep in memory distortion. The present study aims to clarify the role of REM sleep in the facilitation of memory distortion, that is, hindsight bias, compared to non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and wake states. The split-night paradigm was used to segregate REM and NREM sleep. The hypotheses are (1) hindsight bias-memory distortion-is more substantial during REM-rich sleep (late-night sleep) than during NREM-rich sleep (early-night sleep); (2) memory stabilization is more substantial during NREM-rich sleep (early-night sleep) than during REM-rich sleep (late-night sleep); and (3) memory distortion takes longer time than memory stabilization. The results of the hindsight bias test show that more memory distortions were observed after the REM condition in comparison to the NREM condition. Contrary to the hindsight bias, the correct response in the word-pair association test was observed more in the NREM than in the REM condition. The difference in the hindsight bias index between the REM and NREM conditions was identified only one week later. Comparatively, the difference in correct responses in the word-pair association task between the conditions appeared three hours later and one week later. The present study found that (1) memory distortion occurs more during REM-rich sleep than during NREM-rich sleep, while memory stabilization occurs more during NREM-rich sleep than during REM-rich sleep. Moreover, (2) the newly encoded memory could be stabilized immediately after encoding, but memory distortion occurs over several days. These results suggest that the roles of NREM and REM sleep in memory processes could be different.",

      "abstract": "This study presents the development of a wireless in-ear EEG device designed to monitor brain activity during sleep and deliver auditory stimuli aimed at enhancing deep sleep. The device records EEG signals and plays a combined auditory stimulus consisting of autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) and 3 Hz binaural beats at a 60:30 dB ratio, intended to promote delta wave activity and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stage 3 sleep. Fifteen participants completed this study, which included two consecutive nights: a baseline night and a testing night. Participants were divided into an experimental group, which received the combined ASMR and binaural beat stimulus, and a control group, which received only ASMR. The combined stimulus was delivered upon entering NREM stage 2 and replaced by ASMR when NREM stage 3 was reached. Results showed that the experimental group experienced an increase in NREM 3 sleep, a decrease in NREM 2 sleep, and a slight increase in NREM 3 latency compared to the baseline night. Although the findings are promising, further testing with a larger sample size is required to confirm the device's potential to enhance sleep quality and promote delta activity in the brain.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between sleep and cognition has long been recognized, with slow-wave sleep thought to play a critical role in long-term memory consolidation. Recent research has presented the possibility that non-invasive acoustic stimulation during sleep could enhance memory consolidation. Herein, we report a random-effects model meta-analysis examining the impact of this intervention on memory and sleep architecture in healthy adults. Sixteen studies were identified through a systematic search. We found a medium significant effect of acoustic stimulation on memory task performance (g = 0.68, p = .031) in young adults <35 years of age, but no statistically significant effect in adults >35 years of age (g = -0.83, p = .223). In young adults, there was a large statistically significant effect for declarative memory tasks (g = 0.87, p = .014) but no effect for non-declarative tasks (g = -0.25, p = .357). There were no statistically significant differences in polysomnography-derived sleep architecture values between sham and stimulation conditions in either young or older adults. Based on these results, it appears that acoustic stimulation during sleep may only be an effective intervention for declarative memory consolidation in young adults. However, the small number of studies in this area, their small sample sizes, the short-term nature of most investigations and the high between-studies heterogeneity highlight a need for high-powered and long-term experiments to better elucidate, and subsequently maximise, any potential benefits of this novel approach.",

      "abstract": "It has become clear that sleep after learning has beneficial effects on the later retrieval of newly acquired memories. The neural mechanisms underlying these effects are becoming increasingly clear as well, particularly those of non-REM sleep. However, much is still unknown about the sleep and memory relationship: the sleep state or features of sleep physiology that associate with memory performance often vary by task or experimental design, and the nature of this variability is not entirely clear. This paper describes pertinent features of sleep physiology and provides a detailed review of the scientific literature indicating beneficial effects of post-learning sleep on memory retrieval. This paper additionally introduces a hypothesis which attributes these beneficial effects of post-learning sleep to separable processes of memory reinforcement and memory refinement whereby reinforcement supports one's ability to retrieve a given memory and refinement supports the precision of that memory retrieval in the context of competitive alternatives. It is observed that features of non-REM sleep are involved in a post-learning substantiation of memory representations that benefit memory performance; thus, memory reinforcement is primarily attributed to non-REM sleep. Memory refinement is primarily attributed to REM sleep given evidence of bidirectional synaptic plasticity in REM sleep and findings from studies of selective REM sleep deprivation.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition marked by memory impairments and distinct histopathological features such as amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulations. Alzheimer's patients experience sleep disturbances at early stages of the disease. APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mice exhibit sleep disruptions, including reductions in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, that contribute to their disease progression. In addition, astrocytic calcium transients associated with a sleep-dependent brain rhythm, slow oscillations prevalent during NREM sleep, are disrupted in APP mice. However, at present it is unclear whether restoration of circuit function by targeting astrocytic activity could improve sleep in APP mice. To that end, APP mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) targeted to astrocytes underwent optogenetic stimulation at the slow oscillation frequency. Optogenetic stimulation of astrocytes significantly increased NREM sleep duration but not duration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Optogenetic treatment increased delta power and reduced sleep fragmentation in APP mice. Thus, optogenetic activation of astrocytes increased sleep quantity and improved sleep quality in an AD mouse model. Astrocytic activity provides a novel therapeutic avenue to pursue for enhancing sleep and slowing AD progression.",

      "title": "Effects of propofol on sleep architecture and sleep-wake systems in rats.",
      "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that the synchronization of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is found during propofol-induced general anesthesia, which is similar to that of slow-wave sleep (SWS). However, a complete understanding is lacking in terms of the characteristics of EEG changes in rats after propofol administration and whether propofol acts through natural sleep circuits. Here, we examined the characteristics of EEG patterns induced by intraperitoneal injection of propofol in rats. We found that high (10 mg/kg) and medium (5 mg/kg) doses of propofol induced a cortical EEG of low-frequency, high-amplitude activity with rare electromyographic activity and markedly shortened sleep latency. The high dose of propofol increased deep slow-wave sleep (SWS2) to 4 h, as well as the number of large SWS2 bouts (>480 s), their mean duration and the peak of the power density curve in the delta range of 0.75-3.25 Hz. After the medium dose of propofol, the total number of wakefulness, light slow-wave sleep (SWS1) and SWS2 episodes increased, whereas the mean duration of wakefulness decreased. The high dose of propofol significantly increased c-fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) sleep center and decreased the number of c-fos-immunoreactive neurons in wake-related systems including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN), perifornical nucleus (PeF), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LH), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) and supramammillary region (SuM). These results indicated that the high dose of propofol produced high-quality sleep by increasing SWS2, whereas the medium dose produced fragmented and low-quality sleep by disrupting the continuity of wakefulness. Furthermore, sleep-promoting effects of propofol are correlated with activation of the VLPO cluster and inhibition of the TMN, PeF, LH, vPAG and SuM.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin (MLT) is an important circadian signal for sleep regulation, but the neural circuitries underlying the sleep-promoting effects of MLT are poorly understood. The paraventricular thalamus (PVT) is a critical thalamic area for wakefulness control and expresses MLT receptors, raising a possibility that PVT neurons may mediate the sleep-promoting effects of MLT. Here, we found that MLT receptors were densely expressed on PVT neurons and exhibited circadian-dependent variations in C3H/HeJ mice. Application of exogenous MLT decreased the excitability of PVT neurons, resulting in hyperpolarization of membrane potential and reduction of action potential firing. MLT also inhibited the spontaneous activity of PVT neurons at both population and single-neuron levels in freely behaving mice. Furthermore, pharmacological manipulations revealed that local infusion of exogeneous MLT into the PVT promoted non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and increased NREM sleep duration, whereas MLT receptor antagonists decreased NREM sleep. Moreover, we found that selectively knocking down endogenous MLT receptors in the PVT decreased NREM sleep and correspondingly increased wakefulness, with particular changes shortly after the onset of the dark or light phase. Taken together, these results demonstrate that PVT is an important target of MLT for promoting NREM sleep.",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep parasomnias are abnormal motor and/or emotional behaviors originating from \"deep\" slow-wave sleep and with a multifactorial origin. The relationship between NREM parasomnias and psychopathology has been a topic of ongoing debate, but a comprehensive and systematic perspective has been lacking. This systematic review, conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines, aims to fill this gap in the literature. Databases including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from their inception until March 2024. Only studies written in English were included. We selected case-control studies that reported either psychopathological or neurodevelopmental data in NREM sleep parasomnias, or NREM sleep parasomnia data across different mental disorders, across children and adults. Our review found that psychopathological and neurodevelopmental issues are common in NREM parasomnias, with a higher prevalence in affected patients compared to non-affected individuals. Additionally, NREM parasomnias are more common among patients with various psychopathological conditions than in the general population. Medications did not significantly bias these results. These findings suggest that psychopathological aspects should become a core focus of research and treatment strategies for NREM parasomnias.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of arousal (DoA) are NREM parasomnias characterized by motor and emotional behaviors emerging from incomplete arousals from deep sleep. DoA are largely present in pediatric populations, a period during which they are labeled as self-limited manifestations. However, an extensive literature has shown that DoA can persist in adulthood, with different characteristics from childhood DoA. Adult DoA patients usually report excessive daily sleepiness, sleep-related violence during DoA episodes or potentially harmful behaviors, which are rare in childhood. The semeiological features of DoA episodes in adulthood may complicate differential diagnoses with other motor manifestations during sleep, in particular sleep-related hypermotor epilepsy. However, it cannot be excluded that adults with DoA attending sleep centers constitute a more severe phenotype, thus not being representative of adult DoA in the general population. Video-polysomnographic studies of DoA document a spectrum of motor patterns of different complexities, the simplest of which may often go unnoticed. Despite the different complexities of the episodes, neurophysiologic studies showed the co-existence of deep sleep and wakefulness during DoA episodes or even before their onset. These aspects make DoA an ideal model to investigate the mechanisms regulating local sleep, sleep arousal and cognitive functions including spatial and temporal orientation, attention or memory.",

      "abstract": "Spontaneous synchronization over large networks is ubiquitous in nature, ranging from inanimate to biological systems. In the human brain, neuronal synchronization and de-synchronization occur during sleep, with the greatest degree of neuronal synchronization during slow wave sleep (SWS). The current sleep classification schema is based on electroencephalography and provides common criteria for clinicians and researchers to describe stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep as well as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These sleep stage classifications have been based on convenient heuristic criteria, with little consideration of the accompanying normal physiological changes across those same sleep stages. To begin to resolve those inconsistencies, first focusing only on NREM sleep, we propose a simple cluster synchronization model to explain the emergence of SWS in healthy people without sleep disorders. We apply the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) analysis to quantify slow wave activity in electroencephalograms, and provide quantitative evidence to support our model. Based on this synchronization model, NREM sleep can be classified as SWS and non-SWS, such that NREM sleep can be considered as an intrinsically bistable process. Finally, we develop an automated algorithm for SWS classification. We show that this new approach can unify brain wave dynamics and their corresponding physiologic changes.",

      "abstract": "The World Meteorological Organization considers a heatwave as \"a period of statistically unusual hot weather persisting for a number of days and nights\". Accompanying the ongoing global climate change, sharp heatwave bouts occur worldwide, growing in frequency and intensity, and beginning earlier in the season. Heatwaves exacerbate the risk of heat-related illnesses, hence human morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable elderly and children. Heat-related illnesses present a continuum from normothermic (prickly heat, heat edema, heat cramps, heat tetany) to hyperthermic syndromes (from heat syncope and heat exhaustion to lethal heat stroke). Heat stroke may occur through passive heating and/or exertional exercise. \"Normal sleep\", such as observed in temperate conditions, is altered during heatwaves. Brisk excessive heat bouts shorten and fragment human sleep. Particularly, deep N3 sleep (formerly slow-wave sleep) and REM sleep are depleted, such as in other stressful situations. The resultant sleep loss is deleterious to cognitive performance, emotional brain function, behavior, and susceptibility to chronic health conditions and infectious diseases. Our group has previously demonstrated that sleep constitutes an adaptive mechanism during climatic heat acclimatization. In parallel, artificial heat acclimation procedures have been proposed in sports and military activities, and for the elderly. Other preventive actions should be considered, such as education and urban heat island cooling (vegetation, white paint), thus avoiding energy-hungry air conditioning.",

      "abstract": "Besides regulating the amount of light that reaches the retina, fluctuations in pupil size also occur in isoluminant conditions during accommodation, during movement and in relation to cognitive workload, attention and emotion. Recent studies in mammals and birds revealed that the pupils are also highly dynamic in the dark during sleep. However, despite exhibiting similar sleep states (rapid eye movement [REM] and non-REM [NREM] sleep), wake and sleep state-dependent changes in pupil size are opposite between mammals and birds, due in part to differences in the type (striated vs. smooth) and control of the iris muscles. Given the link between pupil dynamics and cognitive processes occurring during wakefulness, sleep-related changes in pupil size might indicate when related processes are occurring during sleep. Moreover, the divergent pupillary behaviour observed between mammals and birds raises the possibility that changes in pupil size in birds are a readout of processes not reflected in the mammalian pupil.",

      "title": "AI-Driven sleep staging from actigraphy and heart rate.",
      "abstract": "Sleep is an important indicator of a person's health, and its accurate and cost-effective quantification is of great value in healthcare. The gold standard for sleep assessment and the clinical diagnosis of sleep disorders is polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG requires an overnight clinic visit and trained technicians to score the obtained multimodality data. Wrist-worn consumer devices, such as smartwatches, are a promising alternative to PSG because of their small form factor, continuous monitoring capability, and popularity. Unlike PSG, however, wearables-derived data are noisier and far less information-rich because of the fewer number of modalities and less accurate measurements due to their small form factor. Given these challenges, most consumer devices perform two-stage (i.e., sleep-wake) classification, which is inadequate for deep insights into a person's sleep health. The challenging multi-class (three, four, or five-class) staging of sleep using data from wrist-worn wearables remains unresolved. The difference in the data quality between consumer-grade wearables and lab-grade clinical equipment is the motivation behind this study. In this paper, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) technique termed sequence-to-sequence LSTM for automated mobile sleep staging (SLAMSS), which can perform three-class (wake, NREM, REM) and four-class (wake, light, deep, REM) sleep classification from activity (i.e., wrist-accelerometry-derived locomotion) and two coarse heart rate measures-both of which can be reliably obtained from a consumer-grade wrist-wearable device. Our method relies on raw time-series datasets and obviates the need for manual feature selection. We validated our model using actigraphy and coarse heart rate data from two independent study populations: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 808) cohort and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS; N = 817) cohort. SLAMSS achieves an overall accuracy of 79%, weighted F1 score of 0.80, 77% sensitivity, and 89% specificity for three-class sleep staging and an overall accuracy of 70-72%, weighted F1 score of 0.72-0.73, 64-66% sensitivity, and 89-90% specificity for four-class sleep staging in the MESA cohort. It yielded an overall accuracy of 77%, weighted F1 score of 0.77, 74% sensitivity, and 88% specificity for three-class sleep staging and an overall accuracy of 68-69%, weighted F1 score of 0.68-0.69, 60-63% sensitivity, and 88-89% specificity for four-class sleep staging in the MrOS cohort. These results were achieved with feature-poor inputs with a low temporal resolution. In addition, we extended our three-class staging model to an unrelated Apple Watch dataset. Importantly, SLAMSS predicts the duration of each sleep stage with high accuracy. This is especially significant for four-class sleep staging, where deep sleep is severely underrepresented. We show that, by appropriately choosing the loss function to address the inherent class imbalance, our method can accurately estimate deep sleep time (SLAMSS/MESA: 0.61±0.69 hours, PSG/MESA ground truth: 0.60±0.60 hours; SLAMSS/MrOS: 0.53±0.66 hours, PSG/MrOS ground truth: 0.55±0.57 hours;). Deep sleep quality and quantity are vital metrics and early indicators for a number of diseases. Our method, which enables accurate deep sleep estimation from wearables-derived data, is therefore promising for a variety of clinical applications requiring long-term deep sleep monitoring.",

COPD is caused by exposure to inhaled noxious particles, notably tobacco smoke and pollutants. However, the broad range of factors that increase the risk of development and progression of COPD throughout the life course are increasingly being recognised. Innovations in omics and imaging techniques have provided greater insight into disease pathobiology, which might result in advances in COPD prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Although few novel treatments have been approved for COPD in the past 5 years, advances have been made in targeting existing therapies to specific subpopulations using new biomarker-based strategies. Additionally, COVID-19 has undeniably affected individuals with COPD, who are not only at higher risk for severe disease manifestations than healthy individuals but also negatively affected by interruptions in health-care delivery and social isolation. This Seminar reviews COPD with an emphasis on recent advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, imaging, diagnosis, and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Daily (circadian) rhythms coordinate our physiology and behaviour with regular environmental changes. Molecular clocks in peripheral tissues (e.g. liver, skeletal muscle and adipose) give rise to rhythms in macronutrient metabolism, appetite regulation and the components of energy balance such that our bodies can align the periodic delivery of nutrients with ongoing metabolic requirements. The timing of meals both in absolute terms (i.e. relative to clock time) and in relative terms (i.e. relative to other daily events) is therefore relevant to metabolism and health. Experimental manipulation of feeding-fasting cycles can advance understanding of the effect of absolute and relative timing of meals on metabolism and health. Such studies have extended the overnight fast by regular breakfast omission and revealed that morning fasting can alter the metabolic response to subsequent meals later in the day, whilst also eliciting compensatory behavioural responses (i.e. reduced physical activity). Similarly, restricting energy intake via alternate-day fasting also has the potential to elicit a compensatory reduction in physical activity, and so can undermine weight-loss efforts (i.e. to preserve body fat stores). Interrupting the usual overnight fast (and therefore also the usual sleep cycle) by nocturnal feeding has also been examined and further research is needed to understand the importance of this period for either nutritional intervention or nutritional withdrawal. In summary, it is important for dietary guidelines for human health to consider nutrient timing (i.e. when we eat) alongside the conventional focus on nutrient quantity and nutrient quality (i.e. how much we eat and what we eat).",

      "title": "A Physical Rehabilitation Approach for Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Literature Review.",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurological ailments. With diverse motor affectations (postural instability, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity), people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) have a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. These include autonomic function changes, cognitive deterioration, neuropsychiatric difficulties, and sleep interruptions. Psychological disturbances, such as anxiety and sadness, are common among PwP. This discomfort is often accompanied by a decrease in general functioning, both at work and in social contacts. Furthermore, people who are experiencing psychological distress have a quick decrease in both physical and cognitive capacities. Furthermore, Pwp who also suffer from anxiety and depression are more likely to acquire dementia. It is worth noting that studies have shown good outcomes in the treatment of physical disabilities in PWP and the various therapeutics available for each affected body part, such as in the legs when they have walking problems, resting tremor in their hands, or micrography, which is a common symptom in these patients. The medical research databases PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were used to look for relevant materials. Upon meticulous scrutiny, a thorough investigation was conducted on the papers at hand. A total of 10 publications were meticulously selected based on stringent qualifying criteria. The present investigation examines various perspectives regarding the physical rehabilitation of individuals diagnosed with PD. The majority of therapeutic interventions employed revolve around cutting-edge technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), combined with exercise regimens. These interventions have demonstrated notable statistical significance in terms of enhancing various physical aspects, including endurance, performance, gait capacity, perception, and overall independence in daily life activities. One of the gathered studies makes use of the therapeutic benefits of yoga to help PwP deal with their anxiety and improve their mental health. Based on the aforementioned information, further investigation is required to ascertain the optimal approach for physical rehabilitation management and develop diverse strategies aimed at assisting individuals with PD in attaining physical autonomy.",

      "abstract": "A sleepless night may feel awful in its aftermath, but sleep's revitalizing powers are substantial, perpetuating the idea that convalescent sleep is a consequence-free physiological reset. Although recent studies have shown that catch-up sleep insufficiently neutralizes the negative effects of sleep debt, the mechanisms that control prolonged effects of sleep disruption are not understood. Here, we show that sleep interruption restructures the epigenome of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and increases their proliferation, thus reducing hematopoietic clonal diversity through accelerated genetic drift. Sleep fragmentation exerts a lasting influence on the HSPC epigenome, skewing commitment toward a myeloid fate and priming cells for exaggerated inflammatory bursts. Combining hematopoietic clonal tracking with mathematical modeling, we infer that sleep preserves clonal diversity by limiting neutral drift. In humans, sleep restriction alters the HSPC epigenome and activates hematopoiesis. These findings show that sleep slows decay of the hematopoietic system by calibrating the hematopoietic epigenome, constraining inflammatory output, and maintaining clonal diversity.",

      "title": "Primary Aldosteronism.",
      "abstract": "Primary aldosteronism is the underlying cause of hypertension in primary care settings in approximately 6% of cases, and it is even more common in patients with resistant hypertension. However, it is estimated that only about 2% of patients who have risk factors for primary aldosteronism have been formally tested or diagnosed. The first step in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism is case detection and involves testing patients who are at risk, including individuals with resistant hypertension, as well as those with well-controlled hypertension and a first-degree relative with primary aldosteronism, hypokalemia, an adrenal nodule, atrial fibrillation, obstructive sleep apnea, or a family history of an early stroke (i.e., younger than 40 years). Initial case detection is performed by simultaneously measuring plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity; an elevated aldosterone-renin ratio (greater than 30) indicates independent aldosterone secretion (i.e., aldosteronism). After a positive case detection, confirmatory testing should be performed. Confirmatory tests include the captopril challenge, oral or intravenous salt loading, or fludrocortisone suppression. Results are positive if aldosterone levels remain high after interventions that suppress or interrupt physiologic production of aldosterone. If the confirmatory test is positive, adrenal computed tomography and adrenal vein sampling should be performed to differentiate unilateral from bilateral adrenal production of aldosterone. Patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism should undergo adrenalectomy, whereas those with bilateral production should be treated with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, such as spironolactone or eplerenone.",

      "abstract": "Every night, we pass through a transitory zone at the borderland between wakefulness and sleep, named the first stage of nonrapid eye movement sleep (N1). N1 sleep is associated with increased hippocampal activity and dream-like experiences that incorporate recent wake materials, suggesting that it may be associated with memory processing. Here, we investigated the specific contribution of N1 sleep in the processing of memory traces. Participants were asked to learn the precise locations of 48 objects on a grid and were then tested on their memory for these items before and after a 30-min rest during which participants either stayed fully awake or transitioned toward N1 or deeper (N2) sleep. We showed that memory recall was lower (10% forgetting) after a resting period, including only N1 sleep compared to N2 sleep. Furthermore, the ratio of alpha/theta power (an electroencephalography marker of the transition toward sleep) correlated negatively with the forgetting rate when taking into account all sleepers (N1 and N2 groups combined), suggesting a physiological index for memory loss that transcends sleep stages. Our findings suggest that interrupting sleep onset at N1 may alter sleep-dependent memory consolidation and promote forgetting.",

      "title": "Sleep in Normal Aging, Homeostatic and Circadian Regulation and Vulnerability to Sleep Deprivation.",
      "abstract": "In the context of geriatric research, a growing body of evidence links normal age-related changes in sleep with many adverse health outcomes, especially a decline in cognition in older adults. The most important sleep alterations that continue to worsen after 60 years involve sleep timing, (especially early wake time, phase advance), sleep maintenance (continuity of sleep interrupted by numerous awakenings) and reduced amount of sigma activity (during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep) associated with modifications of sleep spindle characteristics (density, amplitude, frequency) and spindle-Slow Wave coupling. After 60 years, there is a very clear gender-dependent deterioration in sleep. Even if there are degradations of sleep after 60 years, daytime wake level and especially daytime sleepiness is not modified with age. On the other hand, under sleep deprivation condition, older adults show smaller cognitive impairments than younger adults, suggesting an age-related lower vulnerability to extended wakefulness. These sleep and cognitive age-related modifications would be due to a reduced homeostatic drive and consequently a reduced sleep need, an attenuation of circadian drive (reduction of sleep forbidden zone in late afternoon and wake forbidden zone in early morning), a modification of the interaction of the circadian and homeostatic processes and/or an alteration of subcortical structures involved in generation of circadian and homeostatic drive, or connections to the cerebral cortex with age. The modifications and interactions of these two processes with age are still uncertain, and still require further investigation. The understanding of the respective contribution of circadian and homeostatic processes in the regulation of neurobehavioral function with aging present a challenge for improving health, management of cognitive decline and potential early chronobiological or sleep-wake interventions.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Its Management: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disorder in which there is repeated collapse of the upper airway when the person is in sleep, which causes oxygen desaturation and interrupted sleep. While asleep, airway blockages and collapse are accompanied by awakenings with or without oxygen desaturation. OSA is a prevalent disorder, especially in people with known risk factors and other illnesses. Pathogenesis is variable, and the risk factors include low chest volume, erratic respiratory regulation, and muscular dysfunction in the upper airway dilators. The high-risk factors include overweight, male sex, aging, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, interruption of the menstrual cycle, preservation of liquids, and smoking. The signs are snoring, drowsiness, and apneas. A sleep history, assessment of symptoms, and physical examination are all part of the screening process for OSA, and the data can help determine which people need to be tested for the condition. The results of the polysomnogram or at-home sleep apnea test assist in determining the presence and severity of OSA. Still, it is seen many times that the accuracy of home sleep apnea tests is significantly less, so one should take an expert opinion for the same. OSA results in systemic hypertension, drowsiness, and driving accidents. It is additionally related to diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure (CHF), cerebral infarction, and myocardial infarction, but the exact mechanism is not known. The preferred treatment is continuous positive airway pressure with 60-70% adherence. Other management options include reducing weight, therapy of oral appliances, and correcting any anatomical obstruction (narrow pharyngeal airway, adenoid hypertrophy, and mass in the pharynx). OSA indirectly causes headaches just after awakening and daytime sleepiness. However, there are no age boundaries in OSA as it can occur in any age group. Still, more prevalence is seen in individuals of more than 60 years of age.",

      "abstract": "Although sleep problems are highly prevalent in infants, the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence sleep consolidation and regulation in this age group are not well understood. This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional associations of demographic and parental factors with infant sleep characteristics. Participants were 97 Canadian mother-infant dyads primarily from Edmonton, Alberta. Demographic factors (e.g., infant age), parenting practices (e.g., sleep position, sleep initiation methods), and infants sleep characteristics (e.g., the frequency of nighttime awakenings) were assessed using the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal sleep characteristics (e.g., nighttime sleep duration) were assessed using Actigraph accelerometers. Infant age (mean = 4.24 ± 2.90) was associated with most infant sleep characteristics. In multiple regression models for infant nighttime sleep duration, after removing influential observations, a negative association for side (vs. prone) sleep position was, respectively, observed. In multiple regression models for the frequency of nighttime awakenings in infants, positive associations for infants falling asleep while feeding (vs. in bed alone) and side (vs. prone) sleep position were consistently observed after removing influential observations. Lower nighttime sleep efficiency (",

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent interruptions in breathing during sleep and is associated with a wide range of significant health concerns, particularly cardiovascular complications. This review focuses on the two primary forms of sleep apnea, namely, obstructive and central, with OSA being the most prevalent and commonly linked to conditions, such as hypertension, arrhythmias, and heart failure. Intermittent hypoxemia, activation of the sympathetic nervous system, systemic inflammation, and remodeling of the ventricles are some of the pathophysiological mechanisms that link OSA to cardiovascular disease (CVD). These all lead to higher oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. These processes elevate the risk of CVDs, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, and stroke. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and examined studies published over the last 15 years. The search strategy utilized key terms such as \"sleep disorder,\" \"apnea,\" \"hypertension,\" \"cardiovascular disease (CVD),\" and \"treatment outcomes\" across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A total of 128 unique studies were identified, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. These studies consistently highlighted the significant role OSA plays in exacerbating cardiovascular risks, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Insufficient sleep negatively impacts scholastic performance in children and adolescents. Here we use a dose-response time in bed (TIB) restriction study to evaluate associations between sleep loss and multiple aspects of cognition. We evaluated changes in cognitive measures across ages 10 to 23 years and determined whether the effects of sleep loss changed across this age range. A younger cohort (n = 77, age range 9.9 to 16.2 years) was studied annually for 3 years. An older cohort study (n = 82, age range 15 to 22.8 years) was interrupted by the COVID pandemic with 25 participants completing multiple years. Annually participants completed each of three TIB conditions: four consecutive nights with 7, 8.5, or 10 hours in bed. A day of cognitive testing followed the fourth night. Restricting TIB to 7 hours was associated with impaired top-down attentional control and cognitive flexibility, but performance did not differ between 8.5 and 10 hours of TIB conditions. Psychomotor vigilance test performance decreased as TIB was restricted from 10 to 8.5 hours and decreased further with restriction to 7 hours. Sternberg test measures of working memory were not significantly affected by TIB restriction. The effects of sleep loss on these cognitive measures did not change significantly with age, but age-related improvement in many of the measures may compensate for some sleep loss effects. The findings here do not indicate an adolescent decrease in sleep need; however, the minimal duration of sleep needed for optimal performance appears to differ depending on the cognitive measure.",

      "title": "Asthma therapeutics: Past, present, and future.",
      "abstract": "Asthma is a disease of airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness affecting over 300 million individuals worldwide. Although described as early as 460 BC, the recognition of asthma as a disease, and the development and implementation of therapies to control it, emerged in the early 1900s. The subsequent century introduced the utilization of immunotherapy, inhaled medications, and anti-inflammatory corticosteroids for disease control. Since the beginning of the 21st century, however, the emergence of novel asthma pharmacotherapies has accelerated greatly. Our understanding of various asthma phenotypes and their underlying mechanisms (endotypes) has crystallized, leading to an era of precision medicine. Management strategies increasingly use targeted biologic medications aimed at interrupting key components of the inflammatory cascade. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the IgE, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or interleukin-4, -5, and -13 pathways have revolutionized the care we provide our patients, resulting in a reduction in exacerbations and oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose, while improving lung function and asthma-related quality of life. Although they are able to provide relief for many sufferers of severe disease, and even remission in some, these biologic therapies are still in their infancy. Because their roles become further established, new therapeutic targets and modalities offer significant promise of an even greater personalized medicine approach. This review addresses historical standard-of-care strategies for asthma treatment, current recommendations, and a glimpse into future novel therapies that are likely to help millions worldwide. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Asthma affects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. In the last few decades, asthma treatment paradigms have transformed from recommendations to use anti-inflammatory and bronchodilatory inhalation-based therapies including corticosteroids and beta-agonists, to more precisely targeted add-on biologic therapies that employ monoclonal antibodies addressing specific mechanistic pathways associated with specific patient characteristics. Future therapies promise utilization of personalized medicine to a greater extent with novel therapeutic approaches to help improve the health and quality of life of those suffering from asthma.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization reported that more than 1.6 million healthy life-years are lost yearly from traffic-related noise in western Europe. In addition, the number of studies on health side effects in response to traffic noise is steadily growing, mainly cardiovascular disease, such as acute and chronic ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia, and stroke. Pathophysiologically nighttime noise has been shown to cause sleep disturbances, including too short sleep periods and frequent interruption of sleep leading to an increase in the levels of circulating stress hormones and subsequently to a significant increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (oxidative stress) and inflammation in the vasculature and the brain. The consequence is arterial hypertension and vascular (endothelial) dysfunction, which might increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. With the present review, we give an overview of the \"so-called\" nonauditory cardiovascular health effects of noise, which have been proposed to be responsible for the future development of cardiovascular disease. We present epidemiological evidence but also evidence provided by translational human and experimental noise studies. Finally, we discuss manoeuvres to mitigate noise effectively.",

      "abstract": "Patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) experience intense chronic itch and impaired sleep. Reports from parents and teachers suggest that AD patients may also have attention problems. However, attention has not yet been directly assessed in AD patients. We utilized an objective, computer-based continuous performance test (CPT) validated for use in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis to formally evaluate attention in adolescent AD subjects. This was a single-visit, cross-sectional, non-interventional study of moderate-to-severe (Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA] ≥ 3) AD subjects aged 12-17 years without clinician-diagnosed ADHD. Attention was evaluated using two performance-based measures: Conners, CPT-3 and the Stroop Color and Word Test. The primary parameter was CPT-3 detectability (d') measure. Lesional severity measures included Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and body surface area (BSA) involvement. Subjects completed self-report rating scales assessing sensory responsiveness patterns (Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile [AASP]), itch (Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [PP-NRS]), skin pain, quality of life, sleep, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. A total of 44 subjects were included in the study (61.4% female; mean age 15.0 [SD 1.78] years; mean EASI 20.4 [SD 7.8]; mean PP-NRS 7.0 [SD 1.8]). Results indicated substantial disease impact on sleep, quality of life, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. The mean (SD) Conners, CPT-3 d' T-score was 48.7 (SD 10.7), similar to the expected mean from a randomly selected age/gender-matched sample of the general population (50 [SD 10], by definition). Overall, 13.6% of subjects exhibited a d' T-score ≥ 60 (clinically significant poor performance), which was not greater than the expected general population value (15.9%). Subject-level data review by two psychologists determined that only 2 subjects demonstrated an overall response pattern that clearly indicated attention deficit. Many subjects had atypical sensory responsiveness profiles: sensory hypersensitivity (38.6%), sensory avoidance (50%), and low registration (hypo-sensitivity, 36.4%). Adolescents with moderate-to-severe AD without existing ADHD diagnosis did not demonstrate greater attention problems on performance-based measures than would be expected in age/gender-matched peers.Trial registration NCT05203380.",

Anecdotally, many Sailors consume caffeine to alleviate the effects of poor sleep on alertness, mood, and performance; however, caffeine itself may also degrade sleep quantity and/or quality. This study provides the first exploration of the potential relationship between caffeine use and sleep onboard submarines. Objective measures (wrist actigraphy, available from 45 participants), self-report sleep metrics, and self-reported caffeine consumption were collected from 58 US Navy Sailors before and during a routine submarine underway at sea lasting 30 days. Contrary to expectations, less caffeine was reportedly consumed at sea (232.8 ± 241.1 mg) than on land prior to the underway (M = 284.4 ± 251.7 mg; X",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver. It is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, and patients with NAFLD often have comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. In addition to liver-related complications, NAFLD has been associated with a range of non-liver comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and sleep apnea. Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD, and patients with NAFLD have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than the general population. Chronic kidney disease is also more common in patients with NAFLD, and the severity of NAFLD is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic kidney disease. Sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by breathing interruptions during sleep, is also more common in patients with NAFLD and is associated with the severity of NAFLD. The presence of non-liver comorbidities in patients with NAFLD has important implications for the management of this disease. Treatment of comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia may improve liver-related outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Moreover, treatment of non-liver comorbidities may also improve overall health outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the potential for non-liver comorbidities in patients with NAFLD and should consider the management of these comorbidities as part of the overall management of this disease.",

      "abstract": "No prior studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of zolpidem and zopiclone to treat insomnia of demented patients. This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial used these drugs to treat patients with probable, late onset Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (DSM V and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) exhibiting insomnia (DSM V criteria and nocturnal NPI scores ≥ 2). Actigraphic records were performed for 7 days at baseline and for 14 days during the treatment period in 62 patients aged 80.5 years in average and randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio for administration of zolpidem 10 mg/day, zopiclone 7.5 mg/day or placebo. Primary endpoint was the main nocturnal sleep duration (MNSD), whereas secondary outcomes were the proportion of the night time slept, awake time after sleep onset (WASO), nocturnal awakenings, total daytime sleep time and daytime naps. Cognitive and functional domains were tested before and after drug/placebo use. Three participants under zopiclone use had intervention interrupted due to intense daytime sedation and worsened agitation with wandering. Zopiclone produced an 81 min increase in MNSD (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8, 163.2), a 26 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -56.2, 4.8) and a 2-episode decrease in awakening per night (95% CI: -4.0, 0.4) in average compared to placebo. Zolpidem yielded no significant difference in MNSD despite a significant 22 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -52.5, 8.3) and a reduction of 1 awakening each night (95% CI: -3.4, 1.2) in relation to placebo. There was a 1-point reduction in mean performance in the symbols search test among zolpidem users (95% CI: -4.1, 1.5) and an almost eight-point reduction in average scores in the digit-symbol coding test among zopiclone users (95% CI: -21.7, 6.2). In summary, short-term use of zolpidem or zopiclone by older insomniacs with AD appears to be clinically helpful, even though safety and tolerance remain issues to be personalized in healthcare settings and further investigated in subsequent trials. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03075241.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the sleep measures of wearable devices with a standardized sleep diary in young healthy adults in free-living conditions. We tracked night sleep from 30 participants (19 females, 11 males; 24.3 ± 4.2 years old). Each wore three wearables and simultaneously assessed individual sleep patterns for four consecutive nights.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent underdiagnosed disorder whose incidence increases with age and weight. Uniquely characterised by frequent breathing interruptions during sleep-known as intermittent hypoxia (IH)-OSA disrupts the circadian rhythm. Patients with OSA have repeated episodes of hypoxia and reoxygenation, leading to systemic consequences. OSA consequences range from apparent symptoms like excessive daytime sleepiness, neurocognitive deterioration and decreased quality of life to pathological complications characterised by elevated biomarkers linked to endocrine-metabolic and cardiovascular changes. OSA is a well-recognized risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Furthermore, OSA is linked to other conditions that worsen cardiovascular outcomes, such as obesity. The relationship between OSA and obesity is complex and reciprocal, involving interaction between biological and lifestyle factors. The pathogenesis of both OSA and obesity involve oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. The current medical practice uses continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the gold standard tool to manage OSA. It has been shown to improve symptoms and cardiac function, reduce cardiovascular risk and normalise biomarkers. Nonetheless, a full understanding of the factors involved in the deleterious effects of OSA and the best methods to eliminate their occurrence are still poorly understood. In this review, we present the factors and evidence linking OSA to increased risk of cardiovascular conditions.",

      "title": "Day-night hyperarousal in tinnitus patients.",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus, which affects 12-30 % of the population, is associated with sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction, yet the neural mechanisms that link wake-up states remain unclear. This study investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) characteristics of 51 tinnitus patients and 51 controls across wakefulness (eyes-open, eyes-closed, mental arithmetic) and sleep stages (N1, N2, N3, REM) to clarify day-night pathological mechanisms. The key findings showed persistent hyperarousal in tinnitus: wakefulness revealed enhanced gamma power (30-45 Hz) in eyes-closed and task states, while sleep demonstrated elevated gamma/beta power across all stages accompanied by reduced delta/theta power in deep sleep (N2/N3).). An analysis of sleep structure indicates impaired stability in maintaining the N2 stage among tinnitus patients, corroborating a reduction in N3 duration and an increased proportion of the N2 stage. From the wake states to the sleep stages, group × state interactions for the delta/theta power suggest an impaired state regulation capacity in tinnitus patients. Correlation clustering further revealed aberrant integration of wake-related gamma/beta activity into non-rapid eye movement sleep, indicating neuroplastic overgeneralization of wake hyperarousal into sleep. These results extend the so-called loss-of-inhibition theory to sleep, proposing that deficient low-frequency oscillations fail to suppress hyperarousal, impairing sleep-dependent neuroplasticity, and perpetuating daytime symptoms. Furthermore, this study establishes sleep as a critical therapeutic target to interrupt the 24-h dysfunctional cycle of tinnitus.",

      "title": "Perinatal Hypoxemia and Oxygen Sensing.",
      "abstract": "The development of the control of breathing begins in utero and continues postnatally. Fetal breathing movements are needed for establishing connectivity between the lungs and central mechanisms controlling breathing. Maturation of the control of breathing, including the increase of hypoxia chemosensitivity, continues postnatally. Insufficient oxygenation, or hypoxia, is a major stressor that can manifest for different reasons in the fetus and neonate. Though the fetus and neonate have different hypoxia sensing mechanisms and respond differently to acute hypoxia, both responses prevent deviations to respiratory and other developmental processes. Intermittent and chronic hypoxia pose much greater threats to the normal developmental respiratory processes. Gestational intermittent hypoxia, due to maternal sleep-disordered breathing and sleep apnea, increases eupneic breathing and decreases the hypoxic ventilatory response associated with impaired gasping and autoresuscitation postnatally. Chronic fetal hypoxia, due to biologic or environmental (i.e. high-altitude) factors, is implicated in fetal growth restriction and preterm birth causing a decrease in the postnatal hypoxic ventilatory responses with increases in irregular eupneic breathing. Mechanisms driving these changes include delayed chemoreceptor development, catecholaminergic activity, abnormal myelination, increased astrocyte proliferation in the dorsal respiratory group, among others. Long-term high-altitude residents demonstrate favorable adaptations to chronic hypoxia as do their offspring. Neonatal intermittent hypoxia is common among preterm infants due to immature respiratory systems and thus, display a reduced drive to breathe and apneas due to insufficient hypoxic sensitivity. However, ongoing intermittent hypoxia can enhance hypoxic sensitivity causing ventilatory overshoots followed by apnea; the number of apneas is positively correlated with degree of hypoxic sensitivity in preterm infants. Chronic neonatal hypoxia may arise from fetal complications like maternal smoking or from postnatal cardiovascular problems, causing blunting of the hypoxic ventilatory responses throughout at least adolescence due to attenuation of carotid body fibers responses to hypoxia with potential roles of brainstem serotonin, microglia, and inflammation, though these effects depend on the age in which chronic hypoxia initiates. Fetal and neonatal intermittent and chronic hypoxia are implicated in preterm birth and complicate the respiratory system through their direct effects on hypoxia sensing mechanisms and interruptions to the normal developmental processes. Thus, precise regulation of oxygen homeostasis is crucial for normal development of the respiratory control network. © 2021 American Physiological Society. Compr Physiol 11:1653-1677, 2021.",

      "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a reminder that global infectious disease outbreaks are not new and they have the potential to cause catastrophic morbidity and mortality, disrupt health care delivery, demand critical decision making in the absence of scientific certainty, interrupt trainee education, inflict economic damage, and cause a spike in demand for health care services that exceeds societal capacity. In this article, we look back at how the sleep medicine community adapted to challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. To mitigate viral transmission perhaps the single most effective and efficient adaptation was the rapid adoption of telemedicine. Many additional strategies were taken up virtually overnight, including more home sleep apnea testing, reconsideration of potential risks of positive airway pressure therapy, a reduction or cessation of laboratory services, and deployment of workers to provide frontline care to infected patients. During some periods, critical shortages in essential personal protective equipment, respiratory assist devices, and even oxygen added to logistical challenges, which were exacerbated by persistent financial threats and insufficient staffing. Through ongoing innovation, resiliency, and adaptability, breakthroughs were made in assigning staff responsibilities and designing workflows, using clinical spaces, obtaining legislative support, and achieving professional society collaboration and guidance so that the missions of providing health care, teaching, and academic pursuits could continue. Here we summarize what we have learned through these critical months and highlight key adaptations that deserve to be embraced as we move forward.",

This study examined whether adolescents show a similar spiral, and if so, whether coping self-efficacy-believing one can cope with stress-interrupts the spiral. Temporal dynamics of perceived stress, sleep quality, and coping self-efficacy were tracked in 381 9th graders (49% female, mean age 14.43, age range 14-16) using daily surveys across two school weeks (3184 observations). Though expected associations were evident between individuals, only a unidirectional path was found within individuals from sleep quality to perceived stress via coping self-efficacy. This challenges the conventional bidirectional understanding of sleep-stress relations and suggests coping self-efficacy as an intervention target.",

      "abstract": "Consuming coffee, a widely enjoyed beverage with caffeine, can impact the central nervous system and disturb sleep if taken too close to bedtime. Caffeine impacts sleep by slowing the onset, blocking adenosine receptors, lowering deep sleep levels, disrupting sleep patterns, and lessening rapid eye movement sleep. Although coffee can help with alertness in the morning, it may disturb sleep in the evening, particularly for individuals who are sensitive to caffeine. To enhance the quality of sleep, reduce the consumption of caffeine in the afternoon and evening, refrain from drinking caffeine before going to bed, and choose decaffeinated drinks instead. Variables such as personal reactions, ability to handle caffeine, and engagement with other compounds also influence the impact of coffee on sleep. Keeping track of how much caffeine you consume and your sleeping habits can assist in recognizing any disturbances and making needed changes. Furthermore, taking into account variables such as metabolism, age, and the timing of coffee consumption can assist in lessening the effects of coffee on sleep. In general, paying attention to the amount of caffeine consumed from different sources and consuming it at the right times can assist in preserving healthy sleep patterns even while enjoying coffee.",

      "title": "Sleep timing, chronotype and social jetlag: Impact on cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders.",
      "abstract": "Sleep timing is controlled by the subtle interplay between circadian and homeostatic oscillators which, according to their endogenous properties, allow beings to feel spontaneously that it is time to go to bed or wake up in synchrony with the earth's light/dark cycle. In humans, however, social time and nocturnal artificial light modify sleep timing. Our modern lifestyle and artificial nocturnal light delay our bedtime, make us wake up, and lead to a greater intraindividual variability in sleep timing. Depending on the constraints that social time places on us, our sleep timing may be in or out of phase with the internal circadian timing determined by the circadian clock. When a person's social time is out of phase with their circadian time, they may be considered to suffer from circadian disruption or 'social jetlag'. There are interindividual differences in sleep timing that are known as morningness-eveningness preferences or chronotype, e.g. late chronotypes go to bed later. Chronotype may be assessed in terms of differences in kinetic homeostatic sleep pressure, intrinsic circadian period (ICP) and/or phase angle entrainment. In addition, chronotype depends on genetic and age-related factors, e.g. it gets earlier as people grow older. The social time of late chronotype individuals during week days is not adapted to their circadian time, unlike on free days. This results in social jetlag and circadian disruption, which in turn induces a chronic sleep debt due to a late bedtime and an early wake time, which is compensated on free days but only partially. Sleep and circadian clock disruption generally alter cognitive performance (alertness, attention, memory, higher-order executive functions such as response inhibition and decision-making) but their impact remains to be clarified. When subjects adopt their preferred sleep timing, a \"synchrony effect\" often appears with chronotypes performing better during daytime at optimal than at suboptimal timing (late chronotypes perform better in the evening, early chronotypes in the morning). Evening types appear to be cognitively more vulnerable to suboptimal times than morning types, probably because they have to deal with social jetlag and the \"wake effort\" period after awakening. Circadian disruption, but not chronotype, may impact attentional/inhibitory performance (more impulsivity and inattention). Strong associations have been found between mood disorders or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and chronotype, with these psychiatric disorders typically being overrepresented in evening types. The association between social jetlag and these psychiatric disorders is less obvious. Social jetlag can be corrected by reducing exposure to evening light, although eveningness may be considered as a lifelong factor predisposing to depression or inattention.",

      "abstract": "Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy can ameliorate debilitating and life-threatening symptoms in several inflammatory/immunological disorders. However, it can also cause significant side effects, especially with higher doses and longer duration of use. Therefore, GCs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time to minimise adverse effects. GC therapy may cause suppression of the endogenous hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and abrupt discontinuation predisposes patients to features of GC-induced adrenal insufficiency. The practice of tapering GC therapy allows for recovery of the HPA axis while minimising the risk of a disease flare-up or symptoms of AI. Moderate-to-high dose GC therapy may be tapered rapidly to near-physiological doses while watching for features of disease reactivation. Once close to the physiological dose, tapering is slower and at longer intervals to allow for recovery of the HPA axis. It is important to use short- or intermediate-acting GC preparations such as hydrocortisone or prednisolone in physiological doses, administered in the morning to mimic the endogenous cortisol rhythm. A general principle to follow is that HPA axis recovery takes longer if the period of suppression has been long. In such cases, tapering should be slower over a few months to even a year. In select cases at high risk of AI or if symptoms appear during tapering, the decision to further taper and discontinue steroids may be based on testing of HPA axis function using basal and/or stimulated serum cortisol. All patients on exogenous steroids should be advised about the need for an appropriate increase in GC doses during acute medical or surgical illness and should carry a steroid alert card to avoid adrenal crisis.",

      "abstract": "PHARMACOTHERAPIES FOR INSOMNIA. The first line of treatment in adult chronic insomnia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, its difficult accessibility limited its use and medications are still often prescribed. Considering the drugs with marketing authorization, Z-drugs (zolpidem and zopiclone) if taken at the right hour and dosage promote sleep initiation and have less deleterious effects than benzodiazepines, especially the long-acting ones which should be avoided. This class of drugs cannot be prescribed longer than 28 days. Some antihistaminic licensed drugs are authorized as hypnotics, with a low proof of efficacy and a risk of adverse event as sedation and somnolence the next day. Their prescription should be avoided in old subjects. Some clinicians used antidepressant sedative medications, at low dosage, as hypnotic drugs but \"off label\", outside authorization. Now melatonin, an endogenous synchronizer of biologic rhythms, has obtained the authorization for the treatment of insomniac troubles, in subjects of at least 55 years old, in its slow- release formula, replacing the physiological decline of this hormone with aging. Melatonin is not a hypnotic, but has soporific properties, inducing sleep, improving sleep efficacy, sometimes sleep duration and morning alertness. When discontinued, it induced no withdrawal syndrome. It has shown no risk of abuse potential and no deleterious side-effects, if used at the right dose and in the absence of hepatic interaction with other compounds. Finally, a new class of hypnotics, \"the orexin antagonists\" has its first representative on the French market: daridorexant. The place of these molecules in the therapeutic strategy for chronic insomnia needs to be clarified.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are chronic conditions that negatively affect alertness, mental and physical energy, functioning, and quality of life (QoL). Calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates (low-sodium oxybate; LXB) is an oxybate formulation with 92% less sodium than sodium oxybate (SXB; a treatment for narcolepsy) and the same active moiety. LXB is approved in the US for treatment of cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) in patients 7 years of age or older with narcolepsy, and idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. In Phase 3 clinical trials, LXB exhibited a safety profile consistent with that of SXB in narcolepsy. Besides continued efficacy in treating symptoms, potential benefits of long-term LXB treatment include flexible optimization of dosing and regimen, improvement of QoL and functioning, weight loss, and (relative to SXB in narcolepsy) health benefits of reduced sodium content. Dosing of LXB is twice nightly (for narcolepsy) or once or twice nightly (for idiopathic hypersomnia) based on patient characteristics and response, and individualized titration can be leveraged over the long term as a patient's life circumstances change. Patients with narcolepsy transitioning from SXB initiate LXB at the same dose, and most patients require no further changes to achieve similar efficacy and tolerability. Improvements in functioning and QoL with LXB treatment could have cascading positive effects in multiple domains, particularly in younger patients. In clinical trials, LXB was associated with weight loss in both narcolepsy (in which obesity is a well-established comorbidity) and idiopathic hypersomnia, only occasionally leading participants to be underweight. As both narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are associated with increased risk of cardiometabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities, limiting medication-related sodium intake with LXB may have significant health benefits, although this has not yet been verified prospectively due to the prolonged follow-up required. LXB is a promising long-term treatment for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia.",

The objective of this study was to examine associations between validated measures of chronotype and sleep quality, daytime functioning, alertness, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in US service members (n = 298). Although predominantly young males (who skew toward eveningness in civilian populations), these Sailors skewed toward morningness (35.6% morning, 51.3% intermediate). Eveningness was associated with symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (P < 0.01), less time in bed (P < 0.05), more sleep disruption (P < 0.01), and poorer daytime functioning and alertness (P < 0.05). Evening types were less likely to consider sleep important for performance (P < 0.05). To maximize service member readiness, schedules should be aligned with endogenous rhythms, whenever possible, and evening chronotypes may benefit from targeted interventions. Chronotype should be examined alongside health and readiness in service members.",

      "abstract": "Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co-morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

      "abstract": "As a result of the desire to improve living standards, increasing attention is paid to creating a comfortable and healthy lighting environment that contributes to human health and well-being. It is crucial to understand the effects of environmental lighting regulation on humans' physical responses and mental activities. In this review, we focus on the scientific research on light-induced non-visual effects on humans, providing a systematic review of how the quantity of light, spectral changes, time of day, and duration have effects on the circadian rhythm, alertness, and mood based on eligible literature. The key findings are as follows: (1) The increase of illuminance and correlated colour temperature (CCT) at night were both positively associated with melatonin suppression, thus affecting the circadian rhythm. Meanwhile, a high CCT is conducive to the stimulation of positive mood. (2) Blue light and high CCT light at night induced delayed phase shift, and the objective alertness was reduced under the condition of lack of blue components. (3) High illuminance was positively correlated with subjective alertness during daytime, and increased the positive mood in the morning and decreased it in the afternoon. These findings serve as an important reference for stakeholders to optimise lighting in constructed environments to improve health and well-being considering the non-visual effects above and beyond visual performance.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between daytime light, especially morning light and sleep, has not been well documented. People who work in an office spend most of their time indoors and thus have less access to high-level daylight. The current study employed a field intervention approach to investigate whether exposure to 1.5 h of bright electric light in the early morning for 1 workweek would benefit sleep among students who spent most of their time in an office at the university. Twelve students (24.92 ± 1.78 years) underwent a 2 workday baseline measurement and two inconsecutive 5 workday interventions (with 1 week washout) with morning bright light and regular office light (1000 lx, 6500 K vs. 300 lx, 4000 K, at eye level). The sleep outcomes were recorded with actigraphy and a sleep diary. In addition, self-ratings of daytime sleepiness, mood, mental fatigue, perceived effort, and next morning sleepiness were measured each workday. The results showed that exposure to morning bright light versus regular office light yielded a higher sleep efficiency (83.82% ± 1.60 vs. 80.35% ± 1.57, p = 0.02), a smaller fragmentation index (15.26% ± 1.31 vs. 17.18% ± 1.28, p = 0.05), and a shorter time in bed (7.12 ± 0.13 vs. 7.51 ± 0.12, p = 0.03). Meanwhile, an earlier sleep onset time, shorter sleep latency, and lower morning sleepiness were observed after a 5 workday morning bright light intervention compared with the baseline (ps <0.05), no such benefit was found for self-ratings (ps >0.05). These findings support existing evidence that morning bright light could function as an enhancer of sleep and alertness for office occupants.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents typically sleep too little and feel drowsy during morning classes. We assessed whether morning use of an LED bright light device could increase alertness in school students. Twenty-six (8M/18F) healthy, unmedicated participants, ages 13-18 years, (mean 17.1±1.4) were recruited following screenings to exclude psychopathology. Baseline assessments were made of actigraph-assessed sleep, attention, math solving ability, electroencephalography and structural and functional MRI (N = 10-11, pre-post). Participants nonrandomly received 3-4 weeks of bright light therapy (BLT) for 30 minutes each morning and used blue light blocking glasses for 2 hours before bedtime. BLT devices were modified to surreptitiously record degree of use so that the hypothesis tested was whether there was a significant relationship between degree of use and outcome. They were used 57±18% (range 23%-90%) of recommended time. There was a significant association between degree of use and: (1) increased beta spectral power in frontal EEG leads (primary measure); (2) greater post-test improvement in math performance and reduction in errors of omission on attention test; (3) reduced day-to-day variability in bed times, sleep onset, and sleep duration during school days; (4) increased dentate gyrus volume and (5) enhanced frontal connectivity with temporal, occipital and cerebellar regions during Go/No-Go task performance. BLT was associated with improvement in sleep cycle consistency, arousal, attention and functional connectivity, but not sleep onset or duration (primary measures). Although this was an open study, it suggests that use of bright morning light and blue light blocking glasses before bed may benefit adolescents experiencing daytime sleepiness.

      "abstract": "Psychostimulants can be employed as a countermeasure to cognitive declines resulting from insufficient sleep. Although caffeine is the most consumed psychostimulant, consumption can cause adverse side-effects, including sleep disturbance. Therefore, there is interest in identifying alternative supplements that improve cognitive performance without compromising subsequent sleep. Here we investigate the influence of the dose and timing of theacrine consumption on cognitive performance and subsequent sleep using conditions that replicate a low (100 mg) and high (400 mg) dose consumed in the morning (12 h prior to bedtime), afternoon (eight hours prior to bedtime), and evening (four hours prior to bedtime). We found no significant effect of the low or high theacrine dose on subsequent sleep although the high dose showed small non-significant effects on sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset at each timepoint of consumption. However, consuming theacrine within eight hours of bedtime improved next-morning cognitive performance, with the 400 mg dose reducing the number of lapses on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, although there were no significant effects on reaction time. Our findings provide initial scientific evidence suggesting that theacrine consumption may improve some aspects of next-morning cognitive performance but not others, with small non-significant effects on nighttime sleep.",

      "abstract": "This paper reports the results of a systematic review conducted on articles examining the effects of daytime electric light exposure on alertness and higher cognitive functions. For this, we selected 59 quantitative research articles from 11 online databases. The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020157603). The results showed that both short-wavelength dominant light exposure and higher intensity white light exposure induced alertness. However, those influences depended on factors like the participants' homeostatic sleep drive and the time of day the participants received the light exposure. The relationship between light exposure and higher cognitive functions was not as straightforward as the alerting effect. The optimal light property for higher cognitive functions was reported dependent on other factors, such as task complexity and properties of control light. Among the studies with short-wavelength dominant light exposure, ten studies (morning: 3; afternoon: 7) reported beneficial effects on simple task performances (reaction time), and four studies (morning: 3; afternoon: 1) on complex task performances. Four studies with higher intensity white light exposure (morning: 3; afternoon: 1) reported beneficial effects on simple task performance and nine studies (morning: 5; afternoon: 4) on complex task performance. Short-wavelength dominant light exposure with higher light intensity induced a beneficial effect on alertness and simple task performances. However, those effects did not hold for complex task performances. The results indicate the need for further studies to understand the influence of short-wavelength dominant light exposure with higher illuminance on alertness and higher cognitive functions.",

This study was performed in 41 females. Among them, 15 participants were included in the No-nap group, 14 in the One-nap group (22:00-00:00), and 12 in the Two-nap group (22:30-00:00 and 02:30-03:00). Participants were tested every hour from 16:00 to 09:00 for performance on the Uchida-Kraepelin test, as well as for subjective feelings of fatigue and drowsiness, body temperature, and heart rate variability. The shorter the sleep latency, the worse the alertness immediately after the 90-min nap. The 120-min and 30-min naps also revealed that prolonged total sleep time led to increased fatigue and drowsiness upon awakening. From 04:00 to 09:00, in the No-nap and One-nap groups, fatigue was higher than in the Two-nap group. The One-nap and Two-nap groups did not show improved morning performance. These results suggest that a split nap might improve drowsiness and fatigue during a long night shift.",

      "abstract": "The construct of Morning Affect (MA; alertness upon awakening/time required to feel fully awake) emerged from exploratory factor analysis of morningness-eveningness questionnaires, and while it has been equated with morningness-eveningness preference it has much conceptual overlap with sleep inertia (SI; the transitional state between sleep and being fully awake). The current study compared questionnaire measures of these constructs to help clarify their inter-relationships. A volunteer sample of 453 students at an English-medium university in China completed an online survey including the Sleep Inertia Questionnaire (SIQ), the Morningness-Eveningness-Stability-Scale-improved (MESSi), with subscales for MA, Eveningness, and Distinctness (amplitude of diurnal variation), and the reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ). Measures of depression, sleep quality, mindfulness, and personality were also included. Exploratory factor analysis of the SIQ, MESSi, and rMEQ items revealed seven factors: Cognitive, Emotional, and Physiological SI, Responses to SI (including one MA item), and Duration of SI (one SIQ item, 3/5 MA items, and one rMEQ item); Morningness-Eveningness (MESSi Eveningness items, plus 3/5 rMEQ items); Distinctness (3/5 MESSi items). These results suggest that Morning Affect may be better characterised as a general measure of sleep inertia, and may contribute to ongoing development/refinement of questionnaire measures of circadian functioning.",

      "title": "Pseudo and resistant hypertension: A chaotic perspective.",
      "abstract": "Systemic blood pressure (BP) may oscillate for homeostatic needs (equilibrium by constancy) or just as shifts in other intrinsic and extrinsic variables known as allostatic changes. This transitory pressure often rises alerts physicians to out-of-control hypertension or even hypertensive crisis. There is a very complex theory underlying these stochastic phenomena, which physicists and mathematicians translate into a single word: chaos. These changes happen according to a stochastic probabilistic pattern that presumes chaotic but somewhat predictable and nonlinear modeling of BP-related dynamics as a mathematical approach. Based on the chaos theory, small changes at the initial BP (baseline overtime) values could disturb the homeostasis leading to extreme BP chaotic shifts. These almost insignificant oscillations may also affect other variables and systems, leading to the misdiagnosis of hypertension, \"out-of-control\" BP levels, and resistant hypertension (RHT). Thus, these unpredictable and transient increases in BP values may be improperly diagnosed as the white coat and masked or resistant hypertension. Indeed, the interference of the chaos in any phenotype of (true or false) hard to control BP is not considered in clinical settings. This review provides some basic concepts on chaos theory and BP regulation. Besides pseudoresistant hypertension (lack of adherence, circadian variations, and others (white-coat, masked, early morning effects or hypertension), chaotic changes can be responsible for out-of-control hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Light is detected in the eye by three classes of photoreceptors (rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs)) that are each optimized for a specific function and express a particular light-detecting photopigment. The significant role of short-wavelength light and ipRGCs in improving alertness has been well-established; however, few reviews have been undertaken to assess the other wavelengths' effects regarding timing and intensity. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different narrowband light wavelengths on subjective and objective alertness among the 36 studies included in this systematic review, 17 of which were meta-analyzed. Short-wavelength light (∼460-480 nm) significantly improves subjective alertness, cognitive function, and neurological brain activities at night, even for a sustained period (∼6h) (for λmax: 470/475 nm, 0.4 < |Hedges's g| < 0.6, p < 0.05), but except early morning, it almost does not show this effect during the day when melatonin level is lowest. Long-wavelength light (∼600-640 nm) has little effect at night, but significantly increases several measures of alertness at lower irradiance during the daytime (∼1h), particularly when there is homeostatic sleep drive (for λmax: ∼630 nm, 0.5 < |Hedges's g| < 0.8, p < 0.05). The results further suggest that melanopic illuminance may not always be sufficient to measure the alerting effect of light.",

      "abstract": "Acute hypoglycemia may mimic acute ischemic stroke, but to our knowledge this has never been reported as transient hemineglect syndrome. We present a 60-year-old male with known diabetes mellitus who was brought to the hospital as a stroke alert. The patient had undetectable glucose levels upon arrival of emergency medical services (EMS), therefore hypertonic glucose was given. On our assessment in the emergency department (ED)he turned his head to the right side, looking to the right to answer questions when addressed on his left side. The extinction and neglect assessment revealed left-sided extinction on double tactile and visual stimulation. CT perfusion of the brain showed a decreased perfusion in the right cortical area. Given the unclear last known normal, urgent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; stroke was excluded. The patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit where glucose was closely monitored. Electroencephalogram showed absence of seizure or postictal activity. The following morning, the patient returned to baseline and was able to recall the event. The episode was attributed to the severe hypoglycemia because of a recent medication change.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterize the associations between light exposure in the free-living environment and multiple dimensions of sleep health of typically developing adolescents. Fifty-six (29 girls, 27 boys) typically developing adolescents (mean age = 13.59, SD = 0.89, range = 12-17 years) participated. For six consecutive nights, sleep was assessed in the home environment using actigraphy. During the same period, participants were asked to fill out a daily sleep log and a daily light exposure log, and to complete questionnaires regarding their alertness and subjective sleep satisfaction. Longer self-reported exposure to daylight in the morning was associated with longer objectively measured sleep duration. Longer self-reported exposures to electronic devices in the evening were associated with later objectively measured sleep onset and offset times, shorter sleep duration, and greater day-to-day sleep variability. Longer morning exposure to outdoor light was associated with a longer sleep duration. Self-reported light exposure was not associated with sleep satisfaction, alertness/sleepiness, or sleep efficiency. Among the covariates, circadian preference accounted for the highest percentage of variance. Adolescents' sleep health is associated with the self-reported duration of exposure to daylight in the morning and to electronic devices in the evening.",

A mismatch between the behavioral timing of sleep and the circadian timing of sleepiness/alertness can contribute to insomnia. Patients who report primarily difficulty falling asleep or early morning awakenings may benefit from circadian interventions administered adjunctively to cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia. Specific circadian interventions that clinicians may consider include bright light therapy, scheduled dim light, blue-blocking glasses, and melatonin. Implementation of these interventions differs depending on the patient's insomnia subtype. Further, careful attention must be paid to the timing of these interventions to ensure they are administered correctly.",

      "abstract": "Morning, day, or evening chronotypes differ by the circadian timing of alertness and the preferred timing of sleep. It has been suggested that evening chronotype is associated with low physical activity (PA) and high sedentary time (SED). Our aim was to investigate whether such an association is confirmed by objectively measured PA and SED. In 46-year follow-up of the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 study, total PA (MET min/day) and SED (min/day) among 5156 participants were determined using wrist-worn accelerometers for 14 days. We used the shortened Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire to define participants' chronotypes. As covariates, we used self-reported physical strenuousness of work, health, and demographics, and clinical measures. We used adjusted general linear models (B coefficients with 95% confidence intervals, CI) to analyze how chronotype was related to total PA or SED. As compared to evening chronotype, men with day and morning chronotypes had higher total PA volumes (adjusted B 75.2, 95% CI [8.1, 142.4], P = .028, and 98.6, [30.2, 167.1], P = .005). Men with day and morning chronotypes had less SED (-35.8, [-53.8, 17.8], P < .0001, and - 38.6, [-56.9, -20.2], P < .0001). Among women, morning chronotype was associated with higher total PA (57.8, [10.5, 105.0], P = .017), whereas no association between chronotype and SED emerged. Evening chronotype was associated with low objectively measured PA in both sexes and with high SED in men, even after adjustments for established potential confounders. Chronotype should be considered in PA promotion.",

      "abstract": "There is a lack of research on the relationships between autistic traits and morningness-eveningness. The current research explored associations between autistic traits (preferences for routine, difficulties with imagination, difficulties with social skills, fixations with numbers and patterns, and difficulties with attention switching) and morningness-eveningness, including the component of Morning Affect (alertness/energy upon awakening). The potential mediation effects of depression and insomnia were also tested. 163 adults (university students and general population) completed an online survey including questionnaire measures of autistic traits, morningness-eveningness, depression, and insomnia. Positive correlations were found between most autistic trait subcomponents, depression, and insomnia. The autistic trait of difficulties in attention switching was correlated with more eveningness and with less Morning Affect, but significant correlations were not observed with any other autistic trait. Depression mediated the relationship between eveningness and difficulties in attention switching. Although insomnia alone was not a significant mediator, when combined with depression in a serial mediator model, a significant mediation effect was shown. The current results suggest that greater eveningness may be related with the autistic trait of difficulties in attention switching possibly through the mechanism of increased insomnia and elevated risk for depression. These findings may potentially inform interventions.",

      "abstract": "A 'compressed' shift schedule (substitution of a rest day by a shift, shortening the duration of work breaks) was introduced for a better fit with aircraft traffic load. Thereafter, the company asked for a survey assessing the effects of the compressed shift system. Air traffic controllers (ATCOs) completed retrospectively a specific questionnaire assessing the effects of shift schedule (modified vs. initial) and of traffic load on fatigue, alertness (on-shift, upon awakening, during daily non-work activities), and sleep (duration, satisfaction). Work organization had marginal and unexpected effects, which might indicate ATCOs' disapproval of the intervention. Traffic load affected sleep satisfaction and alertness during work and non-work activities. Specific effects of shift included reduced sleep time prior to morning shifts compared to night shifts, whereas alertness and fatigue were rated at comparable levels for both shifts. Results suggest that shiftwork features which favor sleep loss across a work cycle have deleterious consequences on alertness and increase the need for recovery, which are further enhanced by traffic load.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal affective disorder has been associated with sleep problems, young age, and an evening chronotype. A chronotype refers to an individual's preference in the timing of their sleep-wake cycle, as well as the time during the sleep-wake cycle when a person is most alert and energetic. Seasonality refers to season-dependent fluctuations in sleep length, social activity, mood, weight, appetite, and energy level. Evening chronotype is more common in young adults and morning chronotype more common in the elderly. This study aimed to estimate the differential contribution of chronotype and age on seasonality. A sample of n=410 participants were included in the study. The age groups showed significantly different results according to sleep parameters, depression, anxiety, stress, seasonality, and chronotype. The oldest group (>59 years) showed the lowest scores on all of these scales. According to a path analysis, chronotype and age predict propensity for seasonality. However, sleep problems were linked to chronotype but not to age. Older adults seem to be more resistant to seasonal changes that are perceived as a problem than young and middle aged adults. Future studies would benefit from considering cultural aspects and examine seasonality, chronotype, depression, and insomnia in longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Experimental and interventional studies show that light can regulate sleep timing and sleepiness while awake by setting the phase of circadian rhythms and supporting alertness. The extent to which differences in light exposure explain variations in sleep and sleepiness within and between individuals in everyday life remains less clear. Here, we establish a method to address this deficit, incorporating an open-source wearable wrist-worn light logger (SpectraWear) and smartphone-based online data collection. We use it to simultaneously record longitudinal light exposure (in melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance), sleep timing, and subjective alertness over seven days in a convenience sample of 59 UK adults without externally imposed circadian challenge (e.g., shift work or jetlag). Participants reliably had strong daily rhythms in light exposure but frequently were exposed to less light during the daytime and more light in pre-bedtime and sleep episodes than recommended [T. M.

      "abstract": "Evening chronotype, characterised by a preference for later circadian timing, can present challenges in societal activities oriented towards morning schedules. This study investigates the link between chronotype and sleep, alertness, and internalising symptoms in middle-aged and older adults. The sample comprised 652 healthy adults (ages 35-98) free of sleep, psychiatric, or neurological disorders. All participants completed a 3-min version of the Psychomotor Vigilance Test both in the morning and evening, where the median reaction time served as a measure of behavioural alertness. Additionally, participants completed: (1) the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire for chronotype, (2) the Stanford Sleepiness Scale for subjective alertness, (3) the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep disturbance, and (4) the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire for depression-specific anhedonia, anxiety-specific anxious arousal, and the common internalising factor, general distress. Results indicated that endorsing an evening chronotype provided a transdiagnostic risk factor for general distress, anhedonia, anxious arousal, as well as sleep disturbance and morning subjective sleepiness across middle-aged and older adults. Evening chronotypes showed higher behavioural alertness in the evening, compared to both intermediate and morning chronotypes. These results suggest that chronotype should be considered when promoting healthy ageing and optimal performance.",

      "abstract": "Evening light-emitting visual displays may disrupt sleep, suppress melatonin and increase alertness. Here, we control melanopic irradiance independent of display luminance and colour, in 72 healthy males 4 h before habitual bedtime and expose each of them to one of four luminance levels (i.e., dim light, smartphone, tablet or computer screen illuminance) at a low and a high melanopic irradiance setting. Low melanopic light shortens the time to fall asleep, attenuates evening melatonin suppression, reduces morning melatonin, advances evening melatonin onset and decreases alertness compared to high melanopic light. In addition, we observe dose-dependent increases in sleep latency, reductions in melatonin concentration and delays in melatonin onset as a function of melanopic irradiance-not so for subjective alertness. We identify melanopic irradiance as an appropriate parameter to mitigate the unwanted effects of screen use at night. Our results may help the many people who sit in front of screens in the evening or at night to fall asleep faster, feel sleepier, and have a more stable melatonin phase by spectrally tuning the visual display light without compromising the visual appearance.",

      "title": "Sociodemographic and environmental factors associated with dengue, Zika, and chikungunya among adolescents from two Brazilian capitals.",
      "abstract": "Among the emerging and reemerging arboviral diseases, Zika, dengue and chikungunya deserve special attention due to their wide geographical distribution and clinical severity. The three arboviruses are transmitted by the same vector and can present similar clinical syndromes, bringing challenges to their identification and register. Demographic characteristics and individual and contextual social factors have been associated with the three arboviral diseases. However, little is known about such associations among adolescents, whose relationships with the social environment are different from those of adult populations, implying potentially different places, types, and degrees of exposure to the vector, particularly in the school context. This study aims to identify sociodemographic and environmental risk factors for the occurrence of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya in a cohort of adolescents from the Study of Cardiovascular Risks in Adolescents-ERICA-in the cities of Rio de Janeiro/RJ and Fortaleza/CE, from January 2015 to March 2019. Cases were defined as adolescents with laboratory or clinical-epidemiological diagnosis of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya, notified and registered in the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN). The cases were identified by linkage between the databases of the ERICA cohort and of SINAN. Multilevel Cox regression was employed to estimate hazard ratios (HR) as measures of association and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). In comparison with adolescents living in lower socioeconomic conditions, the risk of becoming ill due to any of the three studied arboviral diseases was lower among those living in better socioeconomic conditions (HR = 0.43; 95%CI: 0.19-0.99; p = 0.047) and in the adolescents who attended school in the afternoon period (HR = 0.17; 95%CI: 0.06-0.47; p<0.001). When compared to areas whose Building Infestation Index (BII) for Aedes aegypti was considered satisfactory, a BII in the school region classified as \"alert\" and \"risk\" was associated with a higher risk of arboviral diseases (HR = 1.62, 95%CI: 0.98-2.70; p = 0.062; HR = 3.72, 95%CI: 1.27-10.9; p = 0.017, respectively). These findings indicate that living in less favored socioeconomic conditions, attending school in the morning, and having a high BII for Ae. aegypti in school's region can contribute to an increased risk of infection by Zika, dengue, or chikungunya in adolescents. The identification of residential or school areas based on those variables can contribute to the implementation of control measures in population groups and priority locations.",

      "abstract": "Abnormalities in resting-state electroencephalogram (rs-EEG) activity have been previously reported in schizophrenia. While most rs-EEG recordings were performed in patients with chronic schizophrenia during eyes closed (EC), only a handful of studies have investigated rs-EEG activity during both EC and eyes open (EO) conditions. It is also unknown whether EC and EO rs-EEG alterations are present at illness onset, and whether they change during the day. Here, we performed EC and EO rs-EEG recordings in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) in twenty-six first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients and seventeen matched healthy controls (HC). In AM/EC rs-EEG, a widespread reduction was found in low alpha power in FEP relative to HC. In PM/EC, the FEP group demonstrated a trend toward decreased theta power in parietal regions, while decreased high alpha power in frontal and left parietal regions was present during PM/EO. Moreover, reduced low alpha power during AM/EC was associated with worse positive symptoms. Altogether, those findings indicate that rs-EEG alterations are present in FEP patients at illness onset, that they are linked to the severity of their psychosis, and that distinct RS abnormalities can be detected in different conditions of visual alertness and time of the day. Future work should therefore account for those factors, which will help reduce variability of rs-EEG findings across studies and may serve as monitoring biomarkers of illness severity in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Eveningness has been associated with maladaptive behavior, poor sleep quality, and psychological disorder. However, while much research has utilized unidimensional measures of morningness-eveningness, the current study aimed to test associations between negative emotionality (depression, anxiety, and stress/DAS) and the circadian rhythm components of morning affect/alertness, eveningness, and amplitude of diurnal variation (distinctness). Associations with maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, neuroticism, conscientiousness, and sleep quality were also investigated, and possible indirect (mediation) effects between the circadian rhythm components and negative emotionality were explored. A sample of 625 Chinese university students (aged 18-33, mean = 19.78; 189 males) completed validated questionnaire measures in an online survey. Morning affect was positively correlated with conscientiousness, and negatively correlated with neuroticism, poor sleep quality, and aspects of maladaptive metacognitive belief (including belief in the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts). Distinctness generally showed the opposite associations. DAS was negatively correlated with morning affect, and positively correlated with eveningness and distinctness. However, after controlling for morning affect the correlations with eveningness were near zero. With either morning affect or distinctness as the predictor for negative emotionality (combined DAS scores), significant indirect effects were found through neuroticism, sleep disturbances, and belief in the uncontrollability and danger of thoughts. These results are consistent with other recent findings that indicate morning affect/alertness, and a stronger amplitude of diurnal variation, may both be more strongly related to negative emotionality than is eveningness preference. They also highlight that these relationships may involve associations with aspects of personality, sleep quality, and also maladaptive metacognitive beliefs. Further research is needed to establish the directions of possible causal relationships, which may help to inform interventions for psychological distress and disorder.",

      "abstract": "Temporal variability of the fMRI-derived blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal during cognitive tasks shows important associations with individual differences in age and performance. Less is known about relations between spontaneous BOLD variability measured at rest and relatively stable cognitive measures, such as IQ or socioemotional function. Here, we examined associations among resting BOLD variability, cognitive/socioemotional scores from the NIH Toolbox and optimal time of day for alertness (chronotype) in a sample of 157 adults from 20 to 86 years of age. To investigate individual differences in these associations independently of age, we regressed age out from both behavioral and BOLD variability scores. We hypothesized that greater BOLD variability would be related to higher fluid cognition scores, more positive scores on socioemotional scales and a morningness chronotype. Consistent with this idea, we found positive correlations between resting BOLD variability, positive socioemotional scores (e.g. self-efficacy) and morning chronotype, as well as negative correlations between variability and negative emotional scores (e.g. loneliness). Unexpectedly, we found negative correlations between BOLD variability and fluid cognition. These results suggest that greater resting brain signal variability facilitates optimal socioemotional function and characterizes those with morning-type circadian rhythms, but individuals with greater fluid cognition may be more likely to show less temporal variability in spontaneous measures of BOLD activity.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms fluctuate throughout the day, but scientists are not sure what underlies these fluctuations. One factor which may explain how OCD symptoms wax and wane throughout the day is alertness. Increased alertness is associated with greater inhibitory control, a factor which plays a significant role in patients' ability to overcome their OCD symptoms. The current study examined the relationship between chronotype (morningness/eveningness preference, a measure of alertness) and within-day OCD symptom severity fluctuations. We hypothesized that increased alertness leads to better inhibitory abilities and, therefore, reduced OCD symptoms. OCD Symptoms were measured through 7-days of monitoring in which participants were asked to retrospectively rate their symptoms at several timepoints throughout the day. Chronotype was measured using the Morningness/Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ). Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed an interaction between chronotype and time of day, such that those with an eveningness preference tended to have worse symptoms in the morning, and vice versa. In addition, we also report novel findings regarding the effect of bedtime, sleep duration, and sleep quality on symptom severity the next day. Taken together, these findings suggest that alertness may modulate OCD symptom severity throughout the day such that individuals experience more severe symptoms during times of low alertness. The clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.",

      "abstract": "We analyzed the characteristics of sustained attention changes in flight crews during exempt and non-exempt flights. Fourteen pilots (aged 30-43 y) participated in this study, with seven involved in each flight type, all of which were intercontinental (China to North America). Pilots completed continuous performance tests (CPT) at the required flight stages without compromising safety while on duty. No significant differences in sleep and sustained attention emerged between the exempt and non-exempt flight crews. Pilots' fatigue was highest in the early morning hours. Their general stability of efficiency increased during the day and decreased at night. Non-exempt flight crews appeared to sacrifice reaction rate to improve accuracy. Exempt crews appeared to increase their test proficiency. The task stability time of the non-exempt flight crews was better than that of the exempt ones. Short-term stability was better for exempt inbound flights rather than for outbound ones. Pilots were more prone to error runs as their total time awake increased, especially on non-exempt flights. The addition of crew members to exempt flights, allowance for more in-flight rest shifts, and over-stop rest on non-exempt flights may alleviate pilot fatigue and preserve alertness.",

An important part of this process is the presence of the well-known hormone, melatonin. This compound assists in the governing of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies have postulated that dysregulation of melatonin rhythms is the driving force behind sleep and circadian disorders. A computer-aided search spanning the years of 2015-2020 using the search terms melatonin, circadian rhythm, disorder yielded 52 full text articles that were analyzed. We explored the mechanisms behind melatonin dysregulation and how it affects various disorders. Additionally, we examined associated therapeutic treatments including bright light therapy (BLT) and exogenous forms of melatonin. We found that over the past 5 years, melatonin has not been widely investigated in clinical studies thus there remains large gaps in its potential utilization as a therapy.",

Alterations in circadian rhythm can lead to chronic disease and impaired sleep. The circadian rhythmicity in human beings is represented by a complex phenotype. Indeed, over a 24-h period, a person's preferred time to be more active or to sleep can be expressed in the concept of morningness-eveningness. Three chronotypes are distinguished: Morning, Neither, and Evening-types. Interindividual differences in chronotypes need to be considered to reduce the negative effects of circadian disruptions on health. In the present review, we examine the bi-directional influences of the rest-activity circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle in chronic pathologies and disorders. We analyze the concept and the main characteristics of the three chronotypes.",

Circadian rhythm dysregulation or chronodisruption has been associated with several diseases, from mental to autoimmune diseases, and with life quality change. Following this, some therapies have been developed to correct circadian misalignments, such as light therapy and chronobiotics. In this manuscript, we describe the circadian-related diseases so far investigated, and studies reporting relevant data on this topic, evidencing this relationship, are included. Despite the actual limitations in published work, there is clear evidence of the correlation between circadian rhythm dysregulation and disease origin/development, and, in this way, clock-related therapies emerge as great progress in the clinical field. Future improvements in such interventions can lead to the development of successful chronotherapy strategies, deeply contributing to enhanced therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Every organism has an intrinsic biological rhythm that orchestrates biological processes in adjusting to daily environmental changes. Circadian rhythms are maintained by networks of molecular clocks throughout the core and peripheral tissues, including immune cells, blood vessels, and perivascular adipose tissues. Recent findings have suggested strong correlations between the circadian clock and cardiovascular diseases. Desynchronization between the circadian rhythm and body metabolism contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases including arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. Circadian rhythms are involved in controlling inflammatory processes and metabolisms, which can influence the pathology of arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. Circadian clock genes are critical in maintaining the robust relationship between diurnal variation and the cardiovascular system. The circadian machinery in the vascular system may be a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The research on circadian rhythms in cardiovascular diseases is still progressing. In this review, we briefly summarize recent studies on circadian rhythms and cardiovascular homeostasis, focusing on the circadian control of inflammatory processes and metabolisms. Based on the recent findings, we discuss the potential target molecules for future therapeutic strategies against cardiovascular diseases by targeting the circadian clock.",

Since the discovery of their molecular foundations in model organisms, many inputs that modify this tightly controlled system in humans have been identified. Polygenic variations and environmental factors influence each person's circadian rhythm, contributing to the trait known as chronotype, which manifests as the degree of morning or evening preference in an individual. Despite normal variation in chronotype, much of society operates on a \"one size fits all\" schedule that can be difficult to adjust to, especially for certain individuals whose endogenous circadian phase is extremely advanced or delayed. This is a public health concern, as phase misalignment in humans is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes. Additionally, modern technology (such as electric lights and computer, tablet, and phone screens that emit blue light) and lifestyles (such as shift or irregular work schedules) are disrupting circadian consistency in an increasing number of people. Though medical and lifestyle interventions can alleviate some of these issues, growing research on endogenous circadian variability and sensitivity suggests that broader social changes may be necessary to minimize the impact of circadian misalignment on health.",

      "abstract": "The circadian rhythm is an evolutionarily conserved time-keeping system that comprises a wide variety of processes including sleep-wake cycles, eating-fasting cycles, and activity-rest cycles, coordinating the behavior and physiology of all organs for whole-body homeostasis. Acute disruption of circadian rhythm may lead to transient discomfort, whereas long-term irregular circadian rhythm will result in the dysfunction of the organism, therefore increasing the risks of numerous diseases especially cancers. Indeed, both epidemiological and experimental evidence has demonstrated the intrinsic link between dysregulated circadian rhythm and cancer. Accordingly, a rapidly increasing understanding of the molecular mechanisms of circadian rhythms is opening new options for cancer therapy, possibly by modulating the circadian clock. In this review, we first describe the general regulators of circadian rhythms and their functions on cancer. In addition, we provide insights into the mechanisms underlying how several types of disruption of the circadian rhythm (including sleep-wake, eating-fasting, and activity-rest) can drive cancer progression, which may expand our understanding of cancer development from the clock perspective. Moreover, we also summarize the potential applications of modulating circadian rhythms for cancer treatment, which may provide an optional therapeutic strategy for cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms are biological systems that synchronize cellular circadian oscillators with the organism's daily feeding-fasting or rest-activity cycles in mammals. Circadian rhythms regulate nutrient absorption and utilization at the cellular level and are closely related to obesity and metabolic disorders. Bile acids are important modulators that facilitate nutrient absorption and regulate energy metabolism. Here, we provide an overview of the current connections and future perspectives between the circadian clock and bile acid metabolism as well as related metabolic diseases. Feeding and fasting cycles influence bile acid pool size and composition, and bile acid signaling can respond to acute lipid and glucose utilization and mediate energy balance. Disruption of circadian rhythms such as shift work, irregular diet, and gene mutations can contribute to altered bile acid metabolism and heighten obesity risk. High-fat diets, alcohol, and gene mutations related to bile acid signaling result in desynchronized circadian rhythms. Gut microbiome also plays a role in connecting circadian rhythms with bile acid metabolism. The underlying mechanism of how circadian rhythms interact with bile acid metabolism has not been fully explored. Sustaining bile acid homeostasis based on circadian rhythms may be a potential therapy to alleviate metabolic disturbance.",

      "abstract": "The circadian clock regulates biological cycles across species and is crucial for physiological activities and biochemical reactions, including cancer onset and development. The interplay between the circadian rhythm and cancer involves regulating cell division, DNA repair, immune function, hormonal balance, and the potential for chronotherapy. This highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm for cancer prevention and treatment. This article investigates the complex relationship between the circadian rhythm and cancer, exploring how disruptions to the internal clock may contribute to tumorigenesis and influence cancer progression. Numerous databases are utilized to conduct searches for articles, such as NCBI, MEDLINE, and Scopus. The keywords used throughout the academic archives are \"circadian rhythm\", \"cancer\", and \"circadian clock\". Maintaining a healthy circadian cycle involves prioritizing healthy sleep habits and minimizing disruptions, such as consistent sleep schedules, reduced artificial light exposure, and meal timing adjustments. Dysregulation of the circadian clock gene and cell cycle can cause tumor growth, leading to the need to regulate the circadian cycle for better treatment outcomes. The circadian clock components significantly impact cellular responses to DNA damage, influencing cancer development. Understanding the circadian rhythm's role in tumor diseases and their therapeutic targets is essential for treating and preventing cancer. Disruptions to the circadian rhythm can promote abnormal cell development and tumor metastasis, potentially due to immune system imbalances and hormonal fluctuations.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms have evolved in almost all organisms enabling them to anticipate alternating changes in the environment. As a consequence, the circadian clock controls a broad range of bodily functions including appetite, sleep, activity and cortisol levels. The circadian clock synchronizes itself to the external world mainly by environmental light cues and can be disturbed by a variety of factors, including shift-work, jet-lag, stress, ageing and artificial light at night. Interestingly, mood has also been shown to follow a diurnal rhythm. Moreover, circadian disruption has been associated with various mood disorders and patients suffering from depression have irregular biological rhythms in sleep, appetite, activity and cortisol levels suggesting that circadian rhythmicity is crucially involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of depression. The aim of the present review is to give an overview and discuss recent findings in both humans and rodents linking a disturbed circadian rhythm to depression. Understanding the relation between a disturbed circadian rhythm and the etiology of depression may lead to novel therapeutic and preventative strategies.",

The night-specific induction of autophagy is both necessary and sufficient for iTRF-mediated health benefits. The study provides the intriguing possibility that novel behavioral or pharmaceutical interventions that promote night-specific autophagy can be used to promote healthy aging.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms integrate a finely tuned network of biological processes recurring every 24 h, intricately coordinating the machinery of all cells. This self-regulating system plays a pivotal role in synchronizing physiological and behavioral responses, ensuring an adaptive metabolism within the environmental milieu, including dietary and physical activity habits. The systemic integration of circadian homeostasis involves a balance of biological rhythms, each synchronically linked to the central circadian clock. Central to this orchestration is the temporal dimension of nutrient and food intake, an aspect closely interwoven with the neuroendocrine circuit, gut physiology, and resident microbiota. Indeed, the timing of meals exerts a profound influence on cell cycle regulation through genomic and epigenetic processes, particularly those involving gene expression, DNA methylation and repair, and non-coding RNA activity. These (epi)genomic interactions involve a dynamic interface between circadian rhythms, nutrition, and the gut microbiota, shaping the metabolic and immune landscape of the host. This research endeavors to illustrate the intricate (epi)genetic interplay that modulates the synchronization of circadian rhythms, nutritional signaling, and the gut microbiota, unravelling the repercussions on metabolic health while suggesting the potential benefits of feed circadian realignment as a non-invasive therapeutic strategy for systemic metabolic modulation via gut microbiota. This exploration delves into the interconnections that underscore the significance of temporal eating patterns, offering insights regarding circadian rhythms, gut microbiota, and chrono-nutrition interactions with (epi)genomic phenomena, thereby influencing diverse aspects of metabolic, well-being, and quality of life outcomes.",

The organization of biological rhythms in time is an adaptation to the cyclical environmental changes brought on by the earth's rotation on its axis and around the sun. Circadian (L. Circa = \"around or approximately\"; diem = \"a day\") rhythms are biological responses to the geophysical light/dark (LD) cycle in which an organism adjusts to alterations in its internal physiology or external environment as a function of the time of day. Sleep has been considered a biological rhythm. Normal human sleep, an essential physiologic process, comprises two distinct phases: non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. A mature adult human's sleep/wake cycle displays a circadian rhythm with a ~24-hour cycle. According to the two-process model of sleep regulation, the human sleep/wake cycle is orchestrated by circadian and homeostatic processes. Sleep homeostasis (a sleep-dependent process) and circadian rhythm (a sleep-independent process) are two biological processes controlling the sleep/wake cycle. There are also ultradian (< 24-hour) rhythms, including the NREM-REM sleep cycle, which has been extensively studied. The clock and sleep genes both influence sleep. In this overview, we have reviewed the circadian genes and their role in regulating sleep. Besides, the gene expression and biological pathways associated with sleep and circadian rhythm-associated diseases also have been highlighted.",

      "title": "Melatonin, ROR-α and circadian rhythm in liver.",
      "abstract": "The liver is the largest internal organ. Several critical functions are attributed to the liver which include metabolism, synthesis of serum proteins, excretion, detoxification, and various physiological processes essential for maintaining body homeostasis. Its unique regenerative capacity helps the liver to restore itself fully after injury. This process involves all hepatocytes with or without the involvement of stem cells. The function of the liver is known to be regulated by circadian rhythm, which includes feeding-fasting cycles and the maintenance of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that regulates as a master clock. The normal functioning of the liver is critical to the overall maintenance of homeostasis as it serves as a peripheral clock, suggesting a potential link between the SCN and liver. Aberrations in these circadian rhythms have been linked to various chronic hepatic diseases such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which can lead to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This mini review explores the significance of circadian rhythm in liver function, with a focus on the role of melatonin and nuclear receptors such as Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor-alpha (RORα), which is a known melatonin receptor critical to sustaining these rhythms that can influence biological functions, including immune system functioning, cell growth, and differentiation. Further, RORα is identified as one of the key regulators of inflammation and acts as a potential tumor suppressor, particularly in the context of HCC. This review explores the interplay between RORα, melatonin, and circadian rhythm and discusses the underpinnings that offer insights into the role of circadian rhythm disruption in HCC development and novel therapeutic strategies targeting circadian rhythm modulations to mitigate HCC.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake cycle allows us, and most life on Earth, to function optimally in a dynamic world, adjusting all aspects of biology to the varied and complex demands imposed by the 24-hour rotation of the Earth upon its axis. A key element in understanding these rhythms, and the success of the field in general, has been because researchers have adopted a comparative approach. Across all taxa, fundamental questions relating to the generation and regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms have been address using biochemical, molecular, cellular, system and computer modelling techniques. Furthermore, findings have been placed into an ecological and evolutionary context. By addressing both the \"How\" - mechanistic, and \"Why\" - evolutionary questions in parallel, the field has achieved remarkable successes, including how circadian rhythms are generated and regulated by light. Yet many key questions remain. In this special issue on the Comparative Physiology of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Journal of Comparative Physiology, important new discoveries are detailed. These findings illustrate the power of comparative physiology to address novel questions and demonstrate that sleep and circadian physiology are embedded within the biological framework of an organism.",

Due to the multifactorial and complex nature of the circadian system, we focus on the highly prevalent phenotypes in the population that are key to understanding its biology from an evolutionary perspective and that can be modulated by lifestyle. Therefore, we leave in the background those phenotypes that constitute infrequent pathologies or in which the current level of scientific evidence does not favour the implementation of practical approaches of this type. Therefore, from an evolutionary paradigm, this chapter addresses phenotypes such as morning chronotypes, evening chronotypes, extreme chronotypes, and other key concepts such as circadian rhythm amplitude, resilience to changes in circadian rhythm, and their relationships with pathologies associated with circadian rhythm imbalances.",

Thus, the present review continues to provide a valuable introduction for those seeking an integrative multilevel overview of the circadian system. In brief, the circadian system comprises a coupled network of molecular/cellular- and tissue-level oscillators, hierarchically coordinated by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclear circadian pacemaker, and entrained by both photic and nonphotic signals.",

      "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE), which limits the daily meal timing to a window of 6-12 h, has been shown to reduce the risks of cardiometabolic diseases through consolidating circadian rhythms of metabolism and physiology. Recent advances indicate that canonical circadian clocks are dispensable for the actions of TRE in the liver, and that meal timing entrains circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues in a tissue-specific manner (e.g., the liver and fat are readily entrainable, whereas the heart and kidneys are resistant). Here, we propose that TRE engages clock-modulated checkpoints (CCPs) to reset circadian rhythms of tissue functions. Elucidation of CCPs would reveal the mechanistic basis of tissue responsiveness to TRE, and facilitate the use of TRE in precision medicine for cardiometabolic diseases.",

Mood disorders such as depression are no exception. Accumulating evidence suggests strong associations between circadian disturbances and the development of depression. Numerous studies have shown that interventions to circadian rhythms trigger depression-like phenotypes in human cases and animal models. Conversely, mood changes can affect circadian rhythms as symptoms of depression. Our preliminary data suggest that the phosphorylation signal pathway of the clock protein may act as a common pathway for mood and clock regulation. We hypothesize that mood regulation and circadian rhythms may influence each other and may share a common regulatory mechanism. This review provides an overview of circadian disturbances in animal models and human patients with depression.",

      "abstract": "Living organisms navigate through a cyclic world: activity, feeding, social interactions are all organized along the periodic succession of night and day. At the cellular level, periodic activity is controlled by the molecular machinery driving the circadian regulation of cellular homeostasis. This mechanism adapts cell function to the external environment and its crucial importance is underlined by its robustness and redundancy. The cell autonomous clock regulates cell function by the circadian modulation of mTOR, a master controller of protein synthesis. Importantly, mTOR integrates the circadian modulation with synaptic activity and extracellular signals through a complex signaling network that includes the RAS-ERK pathway. The relationship between mTOR and the circadian clock is bidirectional, since mTOR can feedback on the cellular clock to shift the cycle to maintain the alignment with the environmental conditions. The mTOR and ERK pathways are crucial determinants of synaptic plasticity and function and thus it is not surprising that alterations of the circadian clock cause defective responses to environmental challenges, as witnessed by the bi-directional relationship between brain disorders and impaired circadian regulation. In physiological conditions, the feedback between the intrinsic clock and the mTOR pathway suggests that also synaptic plasticity should undergo circadian regulation.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms, the natural cycles of physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, are known to have a profound effect on the human body. Light plays an important role in the regulation of circadian rhythm in human body. When light from the outside enters the eyes, cones, rods, and specialized retinal ganglion cells receive the light signal and transmit it to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The central rhythm oscillator of the suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates the rhythm oscillator of tissues all over the body. Circadian rhythms, the natural cycles of physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, are known to have a profound effect on the human body. As the largest organ in the human body, skin plays an important role in the peripheral circadian rhythm regulation system. Like photoreceptor cells in the retina, melanocytes express opsins. Studies show that melanocytes in the skin are also sensitive to light, allowing the skin to \"see\" light even without the eyes. Upon receiving light signals, melanocytes in the skin release hormones that maintain homeostasis. This process is called \"photoneuroendocrinology\", which supports the health effects of light exposure. However, inappropriate light exposure, such as prolonged work in dark environments or exposure to artificial light at night, can disrupt circadian rhythms. Such disruptions are linked to a variety of health issues, emphasizing the need for proper light management in daily life. Conversely, harnessing light's beneficial effects through phototherapy is gaining attention as an adjunctive treatment modality. Despite these advancements, the field of circadian rhythm research still faces several unresolved issues and emerging challenges. One of the most exciting prospects is the use of the skin's photosensitivity to treat diseases. This approach could revolutionize how we think about and manage various health conditions, leveraging the skin's unique ability to respond to light for therapeutic purposes. As research continues to unravel the complexities of circadian rhythms and their impact on health, the potential for innovative treatments and improved wellbeing is immense.",

      "abstract": "Extracellular ATP is a potent signaling molecule released from various cells throughout the body and is intimately involved in the pathophysiological functions of the nervous system and immune system by activating P2 purinergic receptors. Recent increasingly studies showed that extracellular ATP exhibits circadian oscillation with an approximately 24-h periodicity, which participates in regulatory pathways of central oscillator suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral oscillator bladder, respectively. Oscillators modulate the protein expression of ATP release channels and ectonucleotidase activity through clock genes; indeed, real-time alterations of ATP release and degradation determine outcomes of temporal character on extracellular ATP rhythm. The regulatory pathways on extracellular ATP rhythm are different in central and peripheral systems. In this review, we summarize the circadian rhythm of extracellular ATP and discuss several circadian regulatory pathways in different organs via ATP release and degradation, to provide a new understanding for purinergic signaling in the regulatory mechanism of circadian rhythm and a potential target to research the circadian regulation of extracellular ATP in other circadian oscillators.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm is a self-regulating 24-hour system that synchronizes with the day and night cycle in organisms. The regulation of this system is controlled by clock genes, which function to harmoniously express molecular levels that facilitate the orderly coordination of various cellular processes, such as sleep, metabolism, endocrine function, cell proliferation and immunity. The root cause of tumorigenesis is that the body loses its normal regulation of cell growth at the genetic level. Long-term disruptions in circadian rhythms caused by factors such as shift work, jet lag, and unstable sleep patterns can impact cellular health, leading to various health problems, including cancer. Circadian rhythm controls most cellular functions related to cancer progression, which has a significant impact on the ability of immune cells to detect cancer cells and promote their clearance and has crucial implication for future tumor immunotherapy. This article aims to review the crosstalk between dysregulation of circadian rhythm and tumorigenesis, tumor metabolism, and immune response. Additionally, we discuss the role of circadian rhythm disruption in tumor therapy, highlighting its potential to optimize treatment timing and improve therapeutic outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Circadian clocks are universally used to coordinate biological processes with the Earth's 24-h solar day and are critical for the health and environmental success of an organism. Circadian rhythms in eukaryotes are driven by a cell-intrinsic transcription-translation feedback loop that controls daily oscillations in gene expression which regulate diverse physiological functions. Substantial evidence now exists demonstrating that immune activation and inflammatory responses during infection are under circadian control, however, the cellular mechanisms responsible for this are not well understood. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a powerful model organism to study vertebrate circadian biology and immune function. Zebrafish contain homologs of mammalian circadian clock genes which, to our current knowledge, function similarly to impart timekeeping ability. Consistent with studies in mammalian models, several studies in fish have now demonstrated a bidirectional relationship between the circadian clock and inflammation: the circadian clock regulates immune activity, and inflammation can alter circadian rhythms. This review summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the zebrafish clock and the bi-directional relationship between the circadian clock and inflammation in fish.",

An important part of this process is the presence of the well-known hormone, melatonin. This compound assists in the governing of sleep and circadian rhythms. Previous studies have postulated that dysregulation of melatonin rhythms is the driving force behind sleep and circadian disorders. A computer-aided search spanning the years of 2015-2020 using the search terms melatonin, circadian rhythm, disorder yielded 52 full text articles that were analyzed. We explored the mechanisms behind melatonin dysregulation and how it affects various disorders. Additionally, we examined associated therapeutic treatments including bright light therapy (BLT) and exogenous forms of melatonin. We found that over the past 5 years, melatonin has not been widely investigated in clinical studies thus there remains large gaps in its potential utilization as a therapy.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin has become a popular dietary supplement, most known as a chronobiotic, and for establishing healthy sleep. Research over the last decade into cancer, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, fertility, PCOS, and many other conditions, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to greater awareness of melatonin because of its ability to act as a potent antioxidant, immune-active agent, and mitochondrial regulator. There are distinct similarities between melatonin and vitamin D in the depth and breadth of their impact on health. Both act as hormones, affect multiple systems through their immune-modulating, anti-inflammatory functions, are found in the skin, and are responsive to sunlight and darkness. In fact, there may be similarities between the widespread concern about vitamin D deficiency as a \"sunlight deficiency\" and reduced melatonin secretion as a result of \"darkness deficiency\" from overexposure to artificial blue light. The trend toward greater use of melatonin supplements has resulted in concern about its safety, especially higher doses, long-term use, and application in certain populations (e.g., children). This review aims to evaluate the recent data on melatonin's mechanisms, its clinical uses beyond sleep, safety concerns, and a thorough summary of therapeutic considerations concerning dietary supplementation, including the different formats available (animal, synthetic, and phytomelatonin), dosing, timing, contraindications, and nutrient combinations.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is the main hormone involved in the control of the sleep-wake cycle. It is easily synthesisable and can be administered orally, which has led to interest in its use as a treatment for insomnia. Moreover, as production of the hormone decreases with age, in inverse correlation with the frequency of poor sleep quality, it has been suggested that melatonin deficit is at least partly responsible for sleep disorders. Treating this age-related deficit would therefore appear to be a natural way of restoring sleep quality, which is lost as patients age. However, despite the undeniable theoretical appeal of this approach to insomnia, little scientific evidence is available that supports any benefit of this substitutive therapy. Furthermore, the most suitable dose ranges and pharmaceutical preparations for melatonin administration are yet to be clearly defined. This review addresses the physiology of melatonin, the different pharmaceutical preparations, and data on its clinical usefulness.",

To this aim, we first describe the possible pharmacological mechanisms involved in the sleep-promoting properties and then report the corresponding effects of exo-MEL administration on clinical outcomes in: a) healthy subjects, b) circadian rhythm sleep disorders, c) primary insomnia. Timing of administration and doses of exo-MEL received particular attention in this work.

      "abstract": "Melatonin is a fascinating molecule that has captured the imagination of many scientists since its discovery in 1958. In recent times, the focus has changed from investigating its natural role as a transducer of biological time for physiological systems to hypothesized roles in virtually all clinical conditions. This goes along with the appearance of extensive literature claiming the (generally) positive benefits of high doses of melatonin in animal models and various clinical situations that would not be receptor-mediated. Based on the assumption that melatonin is safe, high doses have been administered to patients, including the elderly and children, in clinical trials. In this review, we critically review the corresponding literature, including the hypotheses that melatonin acts as a scavenger molecule, in particular in mitochondria, by trying not only to contextualize these interests but also by attempting to separate the wheat from the chaff (or the wishful thinking from the facts). We conclude that most claims remain hypotheses and that the experimental evidence used to promote them is limited and sometimes flawed. Our review will hopefully encourage clinical researchers to reflect on what melatonin can and cannot do and help move the field forward on a solid basis.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is an indolamine hormone with many physiological and biological roles. Melatonin is an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, free radical scavenger, circadian rhythm regulator, and sleep hormone. However, its most popular role is the ability to regulate sleep through the circadian rhythm. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that melatonin is an important and essential hormone during pregnancy, specifically in the placenta. This is primarily due to the placenta's ability to synthesize its own melatonin rather than depending on the pineal gland. During pregnancy, melatonin acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, which is necessary to ensure a stable environment for both the mother and the fetus. It is an essential antioxidant in the placenta because it reduces oxidative stress by constantly scavenging for free radicals, i.e., maintain the placenta's integrity. In a healthy pregnancy, the maternal immune system is constantly altered to accommodate the needs of the growing fetus, and melatonin acts as a key anti-inflammatory by regulating immune homeostasis during early and late gestation. This literature review aims to identify and summarize melatonin's role as a powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory that reduces oxidative stress and inflammation to maintain a favorable homeostatic environment in the placenta throughout gestation.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have reported inconsistent results about exogenous melatonin's sleep-promoting effects. A possible explanation relies on the heterogeneity in administration schedule and dose, which might be accountable for differences in treatment efficacy. In this paper, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized controlled trials performed on patients with insomnia and healthy volunteers, evaluating the effect of melatonin administration on sleep-related parameters. The standardized mean difference between treatment and placebo groups in terms of sleep onset latency and total sleep time were used as outcomes. Dose-response and meta-regression models were estimated to explore how time of administration, dose, and other treatment-related parameters might affect exogenous melatonin's efficacy. We included 26 randomized controlled trials published between 1987 and 2020, for a total of 1689 observations. Dose-response meta-analysis showed that melatonin gradually reduces sleep onset latency and increases total sleep time, peaking at 4 mg/day. Meta-regression models showed that insomnia status (β = 0.50, p < 0.001) and time between treatment administration and the sleep episode (β = -0.16, p = 0.023) were significant predictors of sleep onset latency, while the time of day (β = -0.086, p < 0.01) was the only significant predictor of total sleep time. Our results suggest that advancing the timing of administration (3 h before the desired bedtime) and increasing the administered dose (4 mg/day), as compared to the exogenous melatonin schedule most used in clinical practice (2 mg 30 min before the desired bedtime), might optimize the efficacy of exogenous melatonin in promoting sleep.",

Importantly, melatonin may also have a role in improving autistic behavioral impairments. The objective of this article is to review factors influencing treatment response and possible side effects following melatonin administration. It appears that the effects of exposure to exogenous melatonin are dependent on age, sex, route and time of administration, formulation type, dose, and association with several substances (such as tobacco or contraceptive pills). In addition, no major melatonin-related adverse effect was described in typical development and ASD. In conclusion, melatonin represents currently a well-validated and tolerated treatment for sleep disorders in children and adolescents with ASD. A more thorough consideration of factors influencing melatonin pharmacokinetics could illuminate the best use of melatonin in this population. Future studies are required in ASD to explore further dose-effect relationships of melatonin on sleep problems and autistic behavioral impairments.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is ubiquitously present in all animals and plants, where it exerts a variety of physiological activities thanks to its antioxidant properties and its key role as the first messenger of extracellular signaling functions. Most of the clinical studies on melatonin refer to its widespread oral use as a dietary supplement to improve sleep. A far smaller number of articles describe the clinical applications of topical melatonin to treat or prevent skin disorders by exploiting its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This review focuses on the clinical studies in which melatonin was applied on the skin as a photoprotective, anti-aging, or hair growth-promoting agent. The methodologies and results of such studies are discussed to provide an overall picture of the state of the art in this intriguing field of research. The clinical studies in which melatonin was applied on the skin before exposure to radiation (UV, sunlight, and high-energy beams) were all characterized by an appropriate design (randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled) and strongly support its clinical efficacy in preventing or reducing skin damage such as dermatitis, erythema, and sunburn. Most of the studies examined in this review do not provide a clear demonstration of the efficacy of topical melatonin as a skin anti-aging or as a hair growth-promoting agent owing to limitations in their design and/or to the use of melatonin combined with extra active ingredients, except for one trial that suggests a possible beneficial role of melatonin in treating some forms of alopecia in women. Further research efforts are required to reach definitive conclusions concerning the actual benefits of topical melatonin to counteract skin aging and hair loss.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most common mental diseases. Anxiety and the associated physical symptoms may disturb social and occupational life and increase the risk of somatic diseases. The pathophysiology of anxiety development is complex and involves alterations in stress hormone production, neurosignaling pathways or free radical production. The various manifestations of anxiety, its complex pathophysiological background and the side effects of available treatments underlie the quest for constantly seeking therapies for these conditions. Melatonin, an indolamine produced in the pineal gland and released into the blood on a nightly basis, has been demonstrated to exert anxiolytic action in animal experiments and different clinical conditions. This hormone influences a number of physiological actions either via specific melatonin receptors or by receptor-independent pleiotropic effects. The underlying pathomechanism of melatonin's benefit in anxiety may reside in its sympatholytic action, interaction with the renin-angiotensin and glucocorticoid systems, modulation of interneuronal signaling and its extraordinary antioxidant and radical scavenging nature. Of importance, the concentration of this indolamine is significantly higher in cerebrospinal fluid than in the blood. Thus, ensuring sufficient melatonin production by reducing light pollution, which suppresses melatonin levels, may represent an endogenous neuroprotective and anxiolytic treatment. Since melatonin is freely available, economically undemanding and has limited side effects, it may be considered an additional or alternative treatment for various conditions associated with anxiety.",

      "abstract": "While primarily produced in the pineal gland, melatonin's influence goes beyond its well-known role in regulating sleep, nighttime metabolism, and circadian rhythms, in the field of chronobiology. A plethora of new data demonstrates melatonin to be a very powerful molecule, being a potent ROS/RNS scavenger with anti-inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and oncostatic properties. Melatonin and its metabolites exert multiple beneficial effects in cutaneous and systemic aging. This review is focused on the neuroprotective role of melatonin during aging. Melatonin has an anti-aging capacity, retarding the rate of healthy brain aging and the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, etc. Melatonin, as well as its metabolites, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK) and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), can reduce oxidative brain damage by shielding mitochondria from dysfunction during the aging process. Melatonin could also be implicated in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions, by modifying their characteristic low-grade neuroinflammation. It can either prevent the initiation of inflammatory responses or attenuate the ongoing inflammation. Drawing on the current knowledge, this review discusses the potential benefits of melatonin supplementation in preventing and managing cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, the effects of melatonin treatment on osteoporotic bone defect and the mechanism underlying the effects of melatonin on angiogenesis are still unclear. Our study was aimed to investigate the potential effects of melatonin on angiogenesis and osteoporotic bone defect. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were isolated from the femur and tibia of rats. The BMSC osteogenic ability was assessed using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red S staining, qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. BMSC-mediated angiogenic potentials were determined using qRT-PCR, western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, scratch wound assay, transwell migration assay, and tube formation assay. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats with tibia defect were used to establish an osteoporotic bone defect model and then treated with melatonin. The effects of melatonin treatment on osteoporotic bone defect in OVX rats were analyzed using micro-CT, histology, sequential fluorescent labeling, and biomechanical test. Our study showed that melatonin promoted both osteogenesis and angiogenesis ",

      "abstract": "Depression is a common chronic psychiatric illness, which is resistant to medical treatments. While melatonin may alleviate certain depression symptoms, evidence for its efficacy against core symptoms is lacking. Here, we tested a mechanism whereby melatonin rescues the behavioral outcomes of the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model of depression. CUMS mice showed depressive behaviors to tail suspension, open field behavior, and sucrose preference test, and cognitive dysfunction in the Morris water maze. Impairments in these measures were relieved by melatonin treatment. Moreover, CUMS mice had impaired glymphatic function across the sleep-wake cycle due to the astrocytic loss and disturbance of circadian regulation of the polarized expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels in perivascular astrocytes. EEG results in CUMS mice showed a reduced total sleep time and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, due to sleep fragmentation in the light phase. CUMS mice lost the normal rhythmic expressions of circadian proteins Per2, Cry2, Bmal1, Clock, and Per1. However, the melatonin treatment restored glymphatic system function and the polarization of AQP4, while improving sleep structure, and rectifying the abnormal expression of Per2, Bmal1, Clock, and Per1 in CUMS mice. Interestingly, Per2 expression correlated negatively with the polarization of AQP4. Further studies demonstrated that Per2 directed the location of AQP4 expression via interactions with the α-dystrobrevin (Dtna) subunit of AQP4 in primary cultured astrocytes. In conclusion, we report a new mechanism whereby melatonin improves depression outcomes by regulating the expression of the circadian protein Per2, maintaining the circadian rhythm of astrocytic AQP4 polarization, and restoring glymphatic function.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disease with recurrent seizures. Its incidence, the social and psychological aspects of epilepsy-associated stigmatization in society, the medical risk of severe seizures, and the challenges in treatment confirm its medical and social significance. The pathogenesis of the diseases is associated with abnormal activity of a population of neurons due to various mechanisms, the most frequent being oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the last 3-4 decades, the possible connection between epilepsy and melatonin - a neurohormone secreted by the pineal gland - has been sought and studied. Various physiological functions of melatonin in humans have been proven - regulation of circadian rhythms (diurnal, seasonal), sleep and wakefulness, participation in the processes of thermoregulation, tumour growth and aging, sexual activity and reproductive functions. It also has immunomodulatory, cytoprotective and antioxidant activity. The results from the studies with experimental models with animals conducted so far in search of a correlation between melatonin and epileptogenesis are mainly in support of the hypothesis of its anticonvulsant effect. The studies with humans are diverse in design, with a smaller number of participants, and the results are not always in explicit support of this hypothesis. The correlation between melatonin concentration and the course of the disease in patients with epilepsy has been discussed. The possibility of adding melatonin to anti-epileptic therapy has also been studied recently.",

The effectiveness of melatonin in mitigating myocardial injuries caused by Doxorubicin through enhancement of mitochondrial function is already established, however, the role of melatonin in regulating the Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1)/Nuclear factor E2-associated factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in lessening the onset of Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy is yet to be elucidated. To address this, H9C2 cardiomyocytes and C57BL/6 mice were employed to construct in vitro and in vivo models of Dox-induced myocardial impairments, respectively. Results showed that Dox markedly evoked oxidative stress, pyroptosis and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, which were significantly alleviated by melatonin administration. Mechanistically, melatonin attenuated Dox-induced downregulation of Sirt1 and Nrf2, and both inhibition of Sirt1 and Nrf2 significantly reversed the cardioprotective effects of melatonin. In conclusion, our studies suggest that the activation of the Sirt1/Nrf2 pathway is the underlying mechanism behind melatonin's ability to curtail oxidative stress, pyroptosis, and apoptosis in Dox-induced cardiomyopathy. These promising results demonstrated the potential application of melatonin as a treatment for doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury.",

Whether melatonin could regulate microglia to protect the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB) remains unknown. In this study, the role of microglia in iBRB breakdown and the mechanisms of melatonin's regulation on microglia were explored. In diabetic rat retinas, activated microglia proliferated and migrated from the inner retina to the outer retina, accompanied by the obvious morphological changes. Meanwhile, significant leakage of albumin was evidenced at the site of close interaction between activated microglia and the damaged pericytes and endothelial cells. ",

      "title": "Dysfunctional mitochondria in age-related neurodegeneration: Utility of melatonin as an antioxidant treatment.",
      "abstract": "Mitochondria functionally degrade as neurons age. Degenerative changes cause inefficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and elevated electron leakage from the electron transport chain (ETC) promoting increased intramitochondrial generation of damaging reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species (ROS and RNS). The associated progressive accumulation of molecular damage causes an increasingly rapid decline in mitochondrial physiology contributing to aging. Melatonin, a multifunctional free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant, is synthesized in the mitochondrial matrix of neurons. Melatonin reduces electron leakage from the ETC and elevates ATP production; it also detoxifies ROS/RNS and via the SIRT3/FOXO pathway it upregulates activities of superoxide dismutase 2 and glutathione peroxidase. Melatonin also influences glucose processing by neurons. In neurogenerative diseases, neurons often adopt Warburg-type metabolism which excludes pyruvate from the mitochondria causing reduced intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A production. Acetyl coenzyme A supports the citric acid cycle and OXPHOS. Additionally, acetyl coenzyme A is a required co-substrate for arylalkylamine-N-acetyl transferase, which rate limits melatonin synthesis; therefore, melatonin production is diminished in cells that experience Warburg-type metabolism making mitochondria more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Moreover, endogenously produced melatonin diminishes during aging, further increasing oxidative damage to mitochondrial components. More normal mitochondrial physiology is preserved in aging neurons with melatonin supplementation.",

      "title": "Melatonin and healthy aging.",
      "abstract": "Preservation of a robust circadian rhythmicity (particulsarly of the sleep/wake cycle), a proper nutrition and adequate physical exercise are key elements for healthy aging. Aging comes along with circadian alteration, e.g. a disrupted sleep and inflammation, that leads to metabolic disorders. In turn, sleep cycle disturbances cause numerous pathophysiological changes that accelerates the aging process. In the central nervous system, sleep disruption impairs several functions, among them, the clearance of waste molecules. The decrease of plasma melatonin, a molecule of unusual phylogenetic conservation present in all known aerobic organisms, plays a particular role as far as the endocrine sequels of aging. Every day, the late afternoon/nocturnal increase of melatonin synchronizes both the central circadian pacemaker located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei as well as myriads of peripheral cellular circadian clocks. This is called the \"chronobiotic effect\" of melatonin, the methoxyindole being the prototype of the endogenous family of chronobiotic agents. In addition, melatonin exerts a significant cytoprotective action by buffering free radicals and reversing inflammation via down regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, suppression of low degree inflammation and prevention of insulin resistance. Because of these properties melatonin has been advocated to be a potential therapeutic tool in COVID 19 pandemic. Melatonin administration to aged animals counteracts a significant number of senescence-related changes. In humans, melatonin is effective both as a chronobiotic and a cytoprotective agent to maintain a healthy aging. Circulating melatonin levels are consistently reduced in the metabolic syndrome, ischemic and non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders like the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The potential therapeutic value of melatonin has been suggested by a limited number of clinical trials generally employing melatonin in the 2-10mg/day range. However, from animal studies the cytoprotective effects of melatonin need higher doses to become apparent (i.e. in the 100mg/day range). Hence, controlled studies employing melatonin doses in this range are urgently needed.",

      "title": "Deletion of ferritin H in neurons counteracts the protective effect of melatonin against traumatic brain injury-induced ferroptosis.",
      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence demonstrates that ferroptosis may be important in the pathophysiological process of traumatic brain injury (TBI). As a major hormone of the pineal gland, melatonin exerts many beneficial effects on TBI, but there is no information regarding the effects of melatonin on ferroptosis after TBI. As expected, TBI resulted in the time-course changes of ferroptosis-related molecules expression and iron accumulation in the ipsilateral cortex. Importantly, we found that treating with melatonin potently rescued TBI induced the changes mentioned above and improved functional deficits versus vehicle. Similar results were obtained with a ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin-1. Moreover, the protective effect of melatonin is likely dependent on melatonin receptor 1B (MT2). Although ferritin plays a vital role in iron metabolism by storing excess cellular iron, its precise function in the brain, and whether it involves melatonin's neuroprotection remain unexplored. Considering ferritin H (Fth) is expressed predominantly in the neurons and global loss of Fth in mice induces early embryonic lethality, we then generated neuron-specific Fth conditional knockout (Fth-KO) mice, which are viable and fertile but have altered iron metabolism. In addition, Fth-KO mice were more susceptible to ferroptosis after TBI, and the neuroprotection by melatonin was largely abolished in Fth-KO mice. In vitro siFth experiments further confirmed the results mentioned above. Taken together, these data indicate that melatonin produces cerebroprotection, at least partly by inhibiting neuronal Fth-mediated ferroptosis following TBI, supporting the notion that melatonin is an excellent ferroptosis inhibitor and its anti-ferroptosis provides a potential therapeutic target for treating TBI.",

It coordinates the work of the superior biological clock and consequently affects many processes in the human body. Disorders of the waking and sleeping period result in nervous system imbalance and generate metabolic and endocrine derangements. The purpose of this review is to provide information regarding the potential benefits of melatonin use, particularly in kidney diseases. The impact on the cardiovascular system, diabetes, and homeostasis causes melatonin to be indirectly connected to kidney function and quality of life in people with chronic kidney disease. Moreover, there are numerous reports showing that melatonin plays a role as an antioxidant, free radical scavenger, and cytoprotective agent. This means that the supplementation of melatonin can be helpful in almost every type of kidney injury because inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress occur, regardless of the mechanism. The administration of melatonin has a renoprotective effect and inhibits the progression of complications connected to renal failure. It is very important that exogenous melatonin supplementation is well tolerated and that the number of side effects caused by this type of treatment is low.",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation leading to oxidative damage to cell membranes. Cell sensitivity to ferroptosis is influenced by factors such as iron overload, lipid metabolism, and the regulation of the antioxidant system. Melatonin, with its demonstrated capacity to chelate iron, modulate iron metabolism proteins, regulate lipid peroxidation, and regulate antioxidant systems, has promise as a potential therapeutic agent in mediating ferroptosis. The availability of approved drugs targeting ferroptosis is limited; therefore, melatonin is a candidate for broad application due to its safety and efficacy in attenuating ferroptosis in noncancerous diseases. Melatonin has been demonstrated to attenuate ferroptosis in cellular and animal models of noncancerous diseases, showcasing effectiveness in organs such as the heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney, and bone. This review outlines the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis, investigates melatonin's potential effects on ferroptosis, and discusses melatonin's therapeutic potential as a promising intervention against diseases associated with ferroptosis. Through this discourse, we aim to lay a strong foundation for developing melatonin as a therapeutic strategy to modulate ferroptosis in a variety of disease contexts.",

      "abstract": "The pineal gland is a interface between light-dark cycle and shows neuro-endocrine functions. Melatonin is the primary hormone of pineal gland, secreted at night. The night-time melatonin peak regulates the physiological functions at dark. Melatonin has several unique features as it synchronises internal rhythm with daily and seasonal variations, regulates circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle. Physiologically melatonin involves in detoxification of free radicals, immune functions, neuro-protection, oncostatic effects, cardiovascular functions, reproduction, and foetal development. The precise functions of melatonin are exhibited by specific receptors. In relation to pathophysiology, impaired melatonin secretion promotes sleep disorder, cancer progression, type-2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Several reports have highlighted the therapeutic benefits of melatonin specially related to cancer protection, sleep disorder, psychiatric disorders, and jet lag problems. This review will touch the most of the area of melatonin-oriented health impacts and its therapeutic aspects.",

      "title": "Protective Activity of Melatonin Combinations and Melatonin-Based Hybrid Molecules in Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
      "abstract": "The identification of protective agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is the mainstay therapeutic goal to modify the disease course and arrest the irreversible disability progression. Pharmacological therapies synergistically targeting multiple pathogenic pathways, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation, are prime candidates for neuroprotection. Combination or synergistic therapy with melatonin, whose decline correlates with altered sleep/wake cycle and impaired glymphatic \"waste clearance\" system in neurodegenerative diseases, has a great therapeutic potential to treat inflammatory neurodegenerative states. Despite the protective outcomes observed in preclinical studies, mild or poor outcomes were observed in clinical settings, suggesting that melatonin combinations promoting synergistic actions at appropriate doses might be more suitable to treat multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we first summarize the key melatonin actions and pathways contributing to cell protection and its therapeutic implication in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). We remark the major controversies in the field, mostly generated by the lack of a common consensus for the optimal dosing, molecular targets, and toxicity. Then, we review the literature investigating the efficacy of melatonin combinations with approved or investigational neuroprotective agents and of melatonin-containing hybrid molecules, both in vitro and in animal models of AD, PD, and MS, as well as the efficacy of add-on melatonin in clinical settings. We highlight the rationale for such melatonin combinations with a focus on the comparison with single-agent treatment and on the assays in which an additive or a synergistic effect has been achieved. We conclude that a better characterization of the mechanisms underlying such melatonin synergistic actions under neuroinflammation at appropriate doses needs to be tackled to advance successful clinical translation of neuroprotective melatonin combination therapies or melatonin-based hybrid molecules.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetes-related complications are amongst the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The international diabetes federation (IDF) has estimated 592 million people to suffer from DM by 2035. Hence, finding a novel biomolecule that can effectively aid diabetes management is vital, as other existing drugs have numerous side effects. Melatonin, a pineal hormone having antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, has been implicated in circadian dysrhythmia-linked DM. Reduced levels of melatonin and a functional link between melatonin and insulin are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Additionally, genomic studies revealed that rare variants in melatonin receptor 1b (MTNR1B) are also associated with impaired glucose tolerance and increased risk of T2D. Moreover, exogenous melatonin treatment in cell lines, rodent models, and diabetic patients has shown a potent effect in alleviating diabetes and other related complications. This highlights the role of melatonin in glucose homeostasis. However, there are also contradictory reports on the effects of melatonin supplementation. Thus, it is essential to explore if melatonin can be taken from bench to bedside for diabetes management. This review summarizes the therapeutic potential of melatonin in various diabetic models and whether it can be considered a safe drug for managing diabetic complications and diabetic manifestations like oxidative stress, inflammation, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation, etc.",

      "title": "Melatonin in Health and Disease: A Perspective for Livestock Production.",
      "abstract": "Mounting evidence in the literature indicates an important role of endogenous and exogenous melatonin in driving physiological and molecular adaptations in livestock. Melatonin has been extensively studied in seasonally polyestrous animals whereby supplementation studies have been used to adjust circannual rhythms in herds of animals under abnormal photoperiodic conditions. Livestock undergo multiple metabolic and physiological adaptation processes throughout their production cycle which can result in decreased immune response leading to chronic illness, weight loss, or decreased production efficiency; however, melatonin's antioxidant capacity and immunostimulatory properties could alleviate these effects. The cardiovascular system responds to melatonin and depending on receptor type and localization, melatonin can vasodilate or vasoconstrict several systemic arteries, thereby controlling whole animal nutrient partitioning via vascular resistance. Increased incidences of non-communicable diseases in populations exposed to circadian disruption have uncovered novel pathways of neurohormones, such as melatonin, influence health, and disease. Perturbations in immune function can negatively impact the growth and development of livestock which has been examined following melatonin supplementation. Specifically, melatonin can influence nutrient uptake, circulating nutrient profiles, and endocrine profiles controlling economically important livestock growth and development. This review focuses on the physiological, cellular, and molecular implications of melatonin on the health and disease of domesticated food animals.",

      "title": "Melatonin and the Programming of Stem Cells.",
      "abstract": "Melatonin interacts with various types of stem cells, in multiple ways that comprise stimulation of proliferation, maintenance of stemness and self-renewal, protection of survival, and programming toward functionally different cell lineages. These various properties are frequently intertwined but may not be always jointly present. Melatonin typically stimulates proliferation and transition to the mature cell type. For all sufficiently studied stem or progenitor cells, melatonin's signaling pathways leading to expression of respective morphogenetic factors are discussed. The focus of this article will be laid on the aspect of programming, particularly in pluripotent cells. This is especially but not exclusively the case in neural stem cells (NSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Concerning developmental bifurcations, decisions are not exclusively made by melatonin alone. In MSCs, melatonin promotes adipogenesis in a Wnt (Wingless-Integration-1)-independent mode, but chondrogenesis and osteogenesis Wnt-dependently. Melatonin upregulates Wnt, but not in the adipogenic lineage. This decision seems to depend on microenvironment and epigenetic memory. The decision for chondrogenesis instead of osteogenesis, both being Wnt-dependent, seems to involve fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. Stem cell-specific differences in melatonin and Wnt receptors, and contributions of transcription factors and noncoding RNAs are outlined, as well as possibilities and the medical importance of re-programming for transdifferentiation.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin, a potent antioxidant and free radical scavenger, has been demonstrated to be effective in gynecological conditions and female reproductive cancers. This review consolidates the accumulating evidence on melatonin's multifaceted protective effects in different pathological contexts. In gynecological conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and uterine leiomyoma, melatonin has shown promising effects in reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and hormonal imbalances. It inhibits adhesion molecules' production, and potentially mitigates leukocyte adherence and inflammatory responses. Melatonin's regulatory effects on hormone production and insulin sensitivity in PCOS individuals make it a promising candidate for improving oocyte quality and menstrual irregularities. Moreover, melatonin exhibits significant antitumor effects by modulating various signaling pathways, promoting apoptosis, and suppressing metastasis in breast cancers and gynecological cancers, including ovarian, endometrial, and cervical cancers. Furthermore, melatonin's protective effects are suggested to be mediated by interactions with its receptors, estrogen receptors and other nuclear receptors. The regulation of clock-related genes and circadian clock systems may also contribute to its inhibitory effects on cancer cell growth. However, more comprehensive research is warranted to fully elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and establish melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent for these conditions.",

      "title": "Melatonin and vitamin D as potential synergistic adjuvants for cancer therapy (Review).",
      "abstract": "Significant advancements have been made in cancer therapy; however, limitations remain with some conventional approaches. Adjuvants are agents used alongside primary treatments to enhance their efficacy and the treatment outcomes of patients. Modern lifestyles contribute to deficiencies in melatonin and vitamin D. Limited sun exposure affects vitamin D synthesis, and artificial light at night suppresses melatonin production. Both melatonin and vitamin D possess anti‑inflammatory, immune‑boosting and anticancer properties, rendering them potential adjuvants of interest. Studies suggest melatonin and vitamin D supplementation may address antioxidant imbalances in lip, oral and pharyngeal cancers. Moreover, promising results from breast, head and neck, brain, and osteosarcoma research indicate potential for tumor growth inhibition, improved survival, and a better quality of life of patients with cancer. The radioprotective properties of melatonin and vitamin D are another exciting area of exploration, potentially enhancing radiotherapy effectiveness while reducing side effects. For its part, the sleep‑promoting effects of melatonin may indirectly benefit patients with cancer by influencing the immune system. Thus, the prevalence of vitamin D and melatonin deficiencies highlights the importance of supplementation, as lower levels can worsen side‑effects from cancer treatments. The present review explores the potential of combining melatonin and vitamin D as synergistic adjuvants for cancer therapy. These agents have shown promise individually in cancer prevention and treatment, and their combined effects warrant investigation. Therefore, large‑scale controlled trials are crucial to definitively determine the optimal dosage, safety and efficacy of this combination in improving the lives of patients with cancer.",

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments and melatonin for sleep initiation and maintenance problems in healthy pediatric populations. We included 30 studies in the systematic review and 15 in the meta-analysis. Three network meta-analyses were conducted for sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and total sleep time (TST). For SOL variable, the results support greater effectiveness of light therapy and melatonin than evidence-based psychological interventions, whether implemented in combination with light therapy or not. Regarding WASO variable, evidence-based psychological interventions and a combination of those techniques plus light treatment were the most efficacious. Finally, for TST variable, a larger effect was shown for the combined treatment of evidence-based psychological intervention with light therapy in comparison to other interventions. In conclusion, we found a high variability between study protocols likely impacting the results of the meta-analysis. Future randomized control trials studies, stratified by pediatric age classes, are needed in order to provide clear suggestions in clinical settings.",

It is suggested that this phenomenon may reflect the fact that, via induction of silent information regulator 1 (Sirt1), melatonin can upregulate K63 polyubiquitination of the mitochondrial antiviral-signalling protein, thereby boosting virally mediated induction of type 1 interferons. Moreover, Sirt1 may enhance the antiviral efficacy of type 1 interferons by preventing hyperacetylation of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), enabling its retention in the nucleus, where it promotes transcription of interferon-inducible genes. This nuclear retention of HMGB1 may also be a mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin therapy in COVID-19-complementing melatonin's suppression of nuclear factor kappa B activity and upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2. If these speculations are correct, a nutraceutical regimen including vitamin D, zinc and melatonin supplementation may have general utility for the prevention and treatment of RNA virus infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza.",

      "abstract": "The fibrogenic conversion of satellite cells contributes to the atrophy and fibrosis of skeletal muscle, playing a significant role in the pathogenesis of age-related sarcopenia. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, exhibits anti-aging and anti-fibrotic effects in various conditions. However, the effect of melatonin on satellite cell fate and age-related sarcopenia remains under-explored. Here, we report that melatonin treatment mitigated the loss of muscle mass and strength in aged mice, replenished the satellite cell pool and curtailed muscle fibrosis. When primary SCs were cultured in vitro and subjected to aging induction via D-galactose, they exhibited a diminished myogenic potential and a conversion from myogenic to fibrogenic lineage. Notably, melatonin treatment effectively restored the myogenic potential and inhibited this lineage conversion. Furthermore, melatonin attenuated the expression of the fibrogenic cytokine, transforming growth factor-β1, and reduced the phosphorylation of its downstream targets Smad2/3 both in vivo and in vitro. In summary, our findings show melatonin's capacity to counteract muscle decline and inhibit fibrogenic conversion in aging SCs and highlight its potential therapeutic value for age-related sarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "The melatonin system and circadian disruption have well-established links with aggressive behaviors; however, the biological underpinnings have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we aimed at examining the current knowledge regarding the neurobiological and psychopharmacological involvement of the melatonin system in aggressive/violent behaviors. To this end, we performed a systematic review on Embase and Pubmed/MEDLINE of preclinical and clinical evidence linking the melatonin system, melatonin, and melatoninergic drugs with aggressive/violent behaviors. Two blinded raters performed an independent screening of the relevant literature. Overall, this review included 38 papers distributed between clinical and preclinical models. Eleven papers specifically addressed the existing evidence in rodent models, five in fish models, and 21 in humans. The data indicate that depending on the species, model, and timing of administration, melatonin may exert a complex influence on aggressive/violent behaviors. Particularly, the apparent contrasting findings on the link between the melatonin system and aggression/violence (with either increased, no, or decreased effect) shown in preclinical models underscore the need for further research to develop more accurate and fruitful translational models. Likewise, the significant heterogeneity found in the results of clinical studies does not allow yet to draw any firm conclusion on the efficacy of melatonin or melatonergic drugs on aggressive/violent behaviors. However, findings in children and in traits associated with aggressive/violent behavior, including irritability and anger, are emerging and deserve empirical attention given the low toxicity of melatonin and melatonergic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin, a versatile hormone produced by the pineal gland, has garnered considerable scientific interest due to its diverse functions. In the eye, melatonin regulates a variety of key processes like inhibiting angiogenesis by reducing vascular endothelial growth factor levels and protecting the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) integrity by enhancing tight junction proteins and pericyte coverage. Melatonin also maintains cell health by modulating autophagy via the Sirt1/mTOR pathways, reduces inflammation, promotes antioxidant enzyme activity, and regulates intraocular pressure fluctuations. Additionally, melatonin protects retinal ganglion cells by modulating aging and inflammatory pathways. Understanding melatonin's multifaceted functions in ocular health could expand the knowledge of ocular pathogenesis, and shed new light on therapeutic approaches in ocular diseases. In this review, we summarize the current evidence of ocular functions and therapeutic potential of melatonin and describe its roles in angiogenesis, BRB integrity maintenance, and modulation of various eye diseases, which leads to a conclusion that melatonin holds promising treatment potential for a wide range of ocular health conditions.",

Furthermore, it participates in antitumor activity, hypopigmentation processes in hyperpigmentary disorders, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating activity in inflammatory dermatoses, maintaining the integrity of the epidermal barrier and thermoregulation of the body. Due predominantly to its positive influence on sleep, melatonin can be used in the treatment of sleep disturbances for those with chronic allergic diseases accompanied by intensive itching (such as atopic dermatitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria). According to the literature data, there are also many proven uses for melatonin in photoprotection and skin aging (due to melatonin's antioxidant effects and role in preventing damage due to DNA repair mechanisms), hyperpigmentary disorders (e.g., melasma) and scalp diseases (such as androgenic alopecia and telogen effluvium).",

      "abstract": "Melatonin is a simple compound called N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine and is known as a hormone controlling the circadian rhythm. Melatonin is produced by the human body naturally. The production of melatonin increases in the evening, causing a state of sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. Melatonin interacts with melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, but it was revealed that melatonin is a strong antioxidant and it also has a role in the regulation of the cell cycle. Melatonin is now used as a medicine to treat some types of sleep disorders. Moreover, recent research suggests that it can also be utilized for other purposes, such as prevention from chemical exposure and treatment of various diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, etc. This review summarizes the basic facts and direction of the current research on melatonin. The existing literature was scrutinized for this review.",

      "title": "Assessment of Fatigue and Recovery in Sport: Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is a phenomenon associated with decreases in both physical and cognitive performances and increases in injury occurrence. Competitive athletes are required to complete demanding training programs with high workloads to elicit the physiological and musculoskeletal adaptations plus skill acquisition necessary for performance. High workloads, especially sudden rapid increases in training loads, are associated with the occurrence of fatigue. At present, there is limited evidence elucidating the underlying mechanisms associating the fatigue generated by higher workloads and with an increase in injury risk. The multidimensional nature and manifestation of fatigue have led to differing definitions and dichotomies of the term. Consequently, a plethora of physiological, biochemical, psychological and performance markers have been proposed to measure fatigue and recovery. Those include self-reported scales, countermovement jump performance, heart rate variability, and saliva and serum biomarker analyses. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of fatigue and recovery plus methods of assessments.",

We show that of the numerous compounds investigated thus far, only two-tart cherry and omega-3 fatty acids-are supported by substantial research evidence.

      "abstract": "Participation in youth sports is ever-increasing, along with training and competition demands placed upon youth athletes. Young athletes may experience high training loads due to playing several sports, as well as participating in school physical education. Therefore, monitoring youth athlete load is an emerging area of research that may help limit non-functional overreaching, injury, or illness and assist with long-term athlete development. This narrative review highlights that multiple measures have been explored to monitor both internal and external load. However, the validity, reliability and practicality of these measures are often not fully understood in female youth populations. The most commonly used external monitoring methods are GPS tracking and TRIMP whereas common internal monitoring tools are questionnaires, perceived exertion rating and heart rate measures. The reporting of injuries and menstrual cycles is also crucial for providing completeness when monitoring an athlete. It has been suggested that the combination of training load, recovery and wellbeing monitoring variables is the optimal way to monitor an athlete's fatigue levels. Whichever monitoring method is applied, in a youth population it is important that the protocol can be individualised, is inexpensive and can be easily implemented and reported so that the monitoring is sustainable.",

      "title": "The Potential Role of Nutrition in Overtraining Syndrome: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Competition between athletes and an increase in sporting knowledge have greatly influenced training methods while increasing the number of them more and more. As a result, the number of athletes who have increased the number and intensity of their workouts while decreasing recovery times is rising. Positive overtraining could be considered a natural and fundamental process when the result is adaptation and improved performance; however, in the absence of adequate recovery, negative overtraining could occur, causing fatigue, maladaptation, and inertia. One of the earliest forms of fatigue is overreaching. It is considered to be an accumulation of training that leads to reduced sports performance, requiring days or weeks to recover. Overreaching, if followed by adequate recovery, can lead to an increase in athletic performance. Nonetheless, if overreaching becomes extreme, combined with additional stressors, it could lead to overtraining syndrome (OTS). OTS, caused by systemic inflammation, leads to central nervous system (CNS) effects, including depressed mood, further inflammation, central fatigue, and ultimately neurohormonal changes. There are therefore not only physiological, biochemical, and immunological but also psychological symptoms or markers that must be considered, independently or together, being intrinsically linked with overtraining, to fully understand OTS. However, to date, there are very few published studies that have analyzed how nutrition in its specific food aspects, if compromised during OTS, can be both etiology and consequence of the syndrome. To date, OTS has not yet been fully studied, and the topic needs further research. The purpose of this narrative review is therefore to study how a correct diet and nutrition can influence OTS in all its aspects, from prevention to treatment.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to identify studies assessing the long-term effects of COVID-19. LitCOVID and Embase were searched to identify articles with original data published before the 1st of January 2021, with a minimum of 100 patients. For effects reported in two or more studies, meta-analyses using a random-effects model were performed using the MetaXL software to estimate the pooled prevalence with 95% CI. PRISMA guidelines were followed. A total of 18,251 publications were identified, of which 15 met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of 55 long-term effects was estimated, 21 meta-analyses were performed, and 47,910 patients were included (age 17-87 years). The included studies defined long-COVID as ranging from 14 to 110 days post-viral infection. It was estimated that 80% of the infected patients with SARS-CoV-2 developed one or more long-term symptoms. The five most common symptoms were fatigue (58%), headache (44%), attention disorder (27%), hair loss (25%), and dyspnea (24%). Multi-disciplinary teams are crucial to developing preventive measures, rehabilitation techniques, and clinical management strategies with whole-patient perspectives designed to address long COVID-19 care.",

      "abstract": "Recovery activities during short breaks taken between work tasks are solutions for preventing the impairing effects of accumulated strain. No wonder then that a growing body of scientific literature from various perspectives emerged on this topic. The present meta-analysis is aimed at estimating the efficacy of micro-breaks in enhancing well-being (vigor and fatigue) and performance, as well as in which conditions and for whom are the micro-breaks most effective. We searched the existent literature on this topic and aggregated the existing data from experimental and quasi-experimental studies. The systematic search revealed 19 records, which resulted in 22 independent study samples (N = 2335). Random-effects meta-analyses shown statistically significant but small effects of micro-breaks in boosting vigor (d = .36, p < .001; k = 9, n = 913), reducing fatigue (d = .35, p < .001; k = 9, n = 803), and a non-significant effect on increasing overall performance (d = .16, p = .116; k = 15, n = 1132). Sub-groups analyses on performance types revealed significant effects only for tasks with less cognitive demands. A meta-regression showed that the longer the break, the greater the boost was on performance.

      "abstract": "We investigated the acute effects of mental fatigue induced by 30-minute use of smartphone social network apps on volume load in resistance training among recreationally trained adults. Sixteen (n = 16) adults of both sexes performed three sets of a half back-squat exercise to failure with 80% of 15RM, interspersed with 3-minutes of passive recovery between sets, before and after two different cognitive tasks: (a) use of smartphone social network apps; and (b) watching a documentary. We assessed mechanical variables and ratings of perceived exertion during the strength exercise. Relative to the documentary-viewing control condition, a 30-minute exposure to smartphone social network apps led participants toward increased perception of mental fatigue (",

      "title": "Physiological significance of elevated levels of lactate by exercise training in the brain and body.",
      "abstract": "For the past 200 years, lactate has been regarded as a metabolic waste end product that causes fatigue during exercise. However, lactate production is closely correlated with energy metabolism. The lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction uses protons to produce lactate, which delays ongoing metabolic acidosis. Of note, lactate production differs depending on exercise intensity and is not limited to muscles. Importantly, controlling physiological effect of lactate may be a solution to alleviating some chronic diseases. Released through exercise, lactate is an important biomarker for fat oxidation in skeletal muscles. During recovery after sustained strenuous exercise, most of the lactate accumulated during exercise is removed by direct oxidation. However, as the muscle respiration rate decreases, lactate becomes a desirable substrate for hepatic glucose synthesis. Furthermore, improvement in brain function by lactate, particularly, through the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, is being increasingly studied. In addition, it is possible to improve stress-related symptoms, such as depression, by regulating the function of hippocampal mitochondria, and with an increasingly aging society, lactate is being investigated as a preventive agent for brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the perception that lactate is equivalent to fatigue should no longer exist. This review focuses on the new perception of lactate and how lactate acts extensively in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain, kidney, and liver. Additionally, lactate is now used to confirm exercise performance and should be further studied to assess its impact on exercise training.",

      "title": "The GDF15-GFRAL axis mediates chemotherapy-induced fatigue in mice.",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue is defined as a distressing persistent subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and that interferes with usual functioning. This form of fatigue is highly prevalent during cancer treatment and in some patients, it can persist for years after treatment has ended. An understanding of the mechanisms that drive cancer-related fatigue is still lacking, which hampers the identification of effective treatment options. Various chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin are known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction and this effect is known to mediate chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in the release of mitokines that act locally and at distance to promote metabolic and behavioral adjustments to this form of cellular stress. One of these mitokines, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and its receptor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor α-like (GFRAL), have received special attention in oncology as activation of GFRAL mediates the anorexic response that is responsible for cancer anorexia. The present study was initiated to determine whether GDF15 and GFRAL are involved in cisplatin-induced fatigue. We first tested the ability of cisplatin to increase circulating GDF15 in mice before assessing whether GDF15 can induce behavioral fatigue measured by decreased wheel running in healthy mice and increase behavioral fatigue induced by cisplatin. Mice administered a long acting form of GDF15, mGDF15-fc, decreased their voluntary wheel running activity. When the same treatment was administered to mice receiving cisplatin, it increased the amplitude and duration of cisplatin-induced decrease in wheel running. To determine whether endogenous GDF15 mediates the behavioral fatigue induced by cisplatin, we then administered a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to GFRAL to mice injected with cisplatin. The GFRAL neutralizing antibody mostly prevented cisplatin-induced decrease in wheel running and accelerated recovery. Taken together these findings demonstrate for the first time the role of the GDF15/GFRAL axis in cisplatin-induced behaviors and indicate that this axis could be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer-related fatigue.",

      "abstract": "In competitive sports, the training load is close to the human physiological limit, which will inevitably lead to exercise-induced fatigue. If fatigue cannot be recovered in time, it will eventually lead to excessive training and affect sport performance. Therefore, fatigue has become an important part of the physical function assessment for athletes. This paper will review animal models of long-term exercise-induced fatigue, modeling schemes of mice under treadmill and swimming training, phenotypes of long-term exercise-induced fatigue (e.g., nervous system damage, myocardial cell damage, bone mineral density changes, and skeletal muscle damage), and fatigue indicators. The relationship between physiological indicators and biomarkers and long-term exercise-induced fatigue is analyzed to promote exercise-induced fatigue monitoring. This paper attempts to provide a reference for the selection of animal models of long-term exercise-induced fatigue and provide a new theoretical basis for medical supervision and recovery of exercise-induced fatigue.",

Hence, this study used neural (electroencephalography) and motor measures to investigate the development and recovery of mental fatigue. Twenty participants performed a 60-min N-back task, with neural activity compared within the task. Additionally, pre-task neural and motor measures were compared to assessments beginning at 0, 30 and 60 min post-task. Alpha power increased during the task and was greater than baseline at 30 and 60 min post-task. Motor skills were impaired at ∼10-17 min post-task but recovered at ∼40-47 min. Using a unique combination of neural and motor measures, our results suggest that attentiveness and, possibly, selectiveness in inhibiting irrelevant information are impaired after an acute mentally-fatiguing task. Notably, recovery time differed for neural and motor measures.",

      "abstract": "Racial and ethnic minority patients experience worse hypertrophic scars after burn injury than White patients. Subsequently, minority patients encounter differences in scar-related recovery domains such as itch and fatigue. This study examines disparities regarding postburn injury itch and fatigue in minority patients to better inform counseling and treatment considerations. From the multicenter National Institute of Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research Burn Model System Database (2015-2019), outcomes were analyzed at three time-points (discharge from index hospitalization, 6- and 12-months post-injury) using the 5D Itch and PROMIS-29 Fatigue measures. Multilevel linear mixed effects regression modeling analyzed associations between race/ethnicities and outcomes over time. Of 893 total patients, minority patients reported higher/worse itch scores at all time points compared to White patients. Itch scores were significantly higher for Black patients at 6 months (β = 1.42, P = .03) and 12 months (β = 3.36, P < .001) when compared to White patients. Black patients reported higher fatigue scores than White patients at all time points. Fatigue scores were significantly higher for Hispanic/Latino patients at discharge (β = 6.17, P < .001), 6 months (β = 4.49, P < .001), and 12 months (β = 6.27, P < .001) than White patients. This study supports investigation of potential factors leading to increased itch and fatigue such as sociocultural factors, disparities in healthcare access, and psychosocial impacts of these symptoms. In the short-term, minority patients may benefit from additional counseling and focused treatments addressing itch and fatigue after burn injury.",

The simple initial theory has been refined to emphasize conservation rather than resource exhaustion, extended to encompass decision making, planning, and initiative, and linked to physical bodily energy (glucose). Recent challenges offered alternative explanations (which have largely failed) and questioned replicability (which has now been well established). Methods have improved, particularly with emphasis on longer, stronger manipulations to ensure fatigue. New work extends ego depletion into workplace settings and sports. Interpersonal conflict may be both a major cause and consequence. New questions include the possibility of chronic ego depletion (e.g., in burnout), protective factors and coping strategies, individual differences, and recovery processes.",

      "abstract": "Lighting interventions can mitigate fatigue by promoting circadian rhythmicity. We test whether individualized, wearable-based lighting interventions delivered via a mobile app reduce cancer-related fatigue in a randomized controlled trial with 138 breast cancer, prostate cancer, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Participants are randomized to tailored lighting intervention or control. The primary endpoint is PROMIS fatigue 4a at trial end, with secondary endpoints including change in daily fatigue, sleep, anxiety, depression, physical function, and overall health. Fatigue T-scores at week 11 do not differ between groups but decrease significantly from week 1 to week 11 (3.07 points, p = 0.001) in the intervention group, with a significant final-week treatment effect (p = 0.014). Daily fatigue, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and physical function improve within intervention. Further studies are needed to see if these results generalize in broader cancer care. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number: NCT04827446).",

      "abstract": "The term fatigue is used to describe states of unusual tiredness and exhaustion that can occur in connection with various chronic diseases, particularly cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast to states of exhaustion in healthy people, fatigue is characterized by the fact that it can last for long periods, is disproportionate to previous activities and does not subside after recovery phases. Fatigue is described as a multidimensional problem that encompasses physical, emotional and cognitive aspects and is associated with a high level of subjective suffering. Depending on the severity and course of the symptoms, fatigue is associated with a severely reduced quality of life and it impairs participation and coping with everyday life. It also makes professional reintegration and reemployment more difficult. Although we cannot yet fully explain the aetiology and pathogenesis, fatigue in physical illnesses must be understood based on a multifactorial biopsychosocial model. The possibilities of diagnostics and an overview of various measures for clarifying fatigue are presented. The challenges for medical care are also outlined and advice is given on how to deal with them in everyday clinical practice.",

Here, we investigated the effects of heat-killed TWK10 on exercise endurance performance, muscle weight and strength, fatigue, and body composition in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Thirty healthy males aged 20-40 years were assigned to the Control group or heat-killed TWK10 group (TWK10-HK) in a balanced order according to each individual's initial maximal oxygen uptake. After 6-week administration, the exercise endurance time in the TWK10-HK was significantly increased (p = 0.0028) compared with that in the Control group. The grip strength on the right and left hands of the subjects was significantly increased (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.0140, respectively) in the TWK10-HK compared with that in the Control group. Administration of heat-killed TWK10 resulted in a significant increase (p = 0.0275) in muscle weight. After 6-week administration, serum lactate, and ammonia levels were significantly lower in the TWK10-HK group than in the Control group during the exercise and recovery periods. These findings demonstrate that heat-killed TWK10 has significant potential to be used as a postbiotic for humans.",

      "abstract": "The term \"wellness\" embraces a wide spectrum of methods that impact the human body by restoring its capabilities and functions, which were previously depleted as a result of increased physical and mental activities such, i.e. sport. Judging by the number of amateur, semi-professional, and professional sporting events at local and national levels, societies consider sports a major part of their everyday lives. A growing percentage of the population is exposing their bodies to various strains, which may result in fatigue, overtraining and injuries, and so the market demand for recovery-related services is on the rise. Therefore, this paper is an overview of the most important and the latest wellness systems and methods applied in today's sport. They divide into three areas: pedagogical, psychological and medical-biological. Among the most popular treatments are: light radiation with infrared rays, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, magnetotherapy, ultrasound and laser therapy, as well as a sauna, paraffin compress, mud compress and brine baths. In a broader context, the paper also acknowledges the growing demand for better body recovery methods and the latest developments in the field of sport physiotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Enhancing recovery is a fundamental component of high-performance sports training since it enables practitioners to potentiate physical performance and minimise the risk of injuries. Using a new sports legging embedded with an intelligent system for electrostimulation, localised heating and compression (completely embodied into the textile structures), we aimed to analyse acute recovery following a fatigue protocol. Surface electromyography- and torque-related variables were recorded on eight recreational athletes. A fatigue protocol conducted in an isokinetic dynamometer allowed us to examine isometric torque and consequent post-exercise acute recovery after using the sports legging. Regarding peak torque, no differences were found between post-fatigue and post-recovery assessments in any variable; however, pre-fatigue registered a 16% greater peak torque when compared with post-fatigue for localised heating and compression recovery methods. Our data are supported by recent meta-analyses indicating that individual recovery methods, such as localised heating, electrostimulation and compression, are not effective to recover from a fatiguing exercise. In fact, none of the recovery methods available through the sports legging tested was effective in acutely recovering the torque values produced isometrically.",

      "title": "The Influence of Fatigue, Recovery, and Environmental Factors on the Body Stability of Construction Workers.",
      "abstract": "In the construction industry, falls, slips, and trips (FST) account for 42.3% of all accidents. The primary cause of FST incidents is directly related to the deterioration of workers' body stability. To prevent FST-related accidents, it is crucial to understand the interaction between physical fatigue and body stability in construction workers. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of fatigue on body stability in various construction site environments using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) analysis. We conducted experiments reflecting six different fatigue levels and four environmental conditions. The analysis process involves comparing changes in DTW values derived from acceleration data obtained through wearable sensors across varying fatigue levels and construction environments. The results reveal the following changes in DTW values across different environments and fatigue levels: for non-obstacle, obstacle, water, and oil conditions, DTW values tend to increase as fatigue levels rise. In our experiments, we observed a significant decrease in body stability against external environments starting from fatigue Levels 3 or 4 (30% and 40% of the maximum failure point). In the non-obstacle condition, the DTW values were 9.4 at Level 0, 12.8 at Level 3, and 23.1 at Level 5. In contrast, for the oil condition, which exhibited the highest DTW values, the values were 10.5 at Level 0, 19.1 at Level 3, and 34.5 at Level 5. These experimental results confirm that the body stability of construction workers is influenced by both fatigue levels and external environmental conditions. Further analysis of recovery time, defined as the time it takes for body stability to return to its original level, revealed an increasing trend in recovery time as fatigue levels increased. This study quantitatively demonstrates through wearable sensor data that, as fatigue levels increase, workers experience decreased body stability and longer recovery times. The findings of this study can inform individual worker fatigue management in the future.",

      "abstract": "The rugby codes (i.e., rugby union, rugby league, rugby sevens [termed 'rugby']) are team-sports that impose multiple complex physical, perceptual, and technical demands on players which leads to substantial player fatigue post-match. In the post-match period, fatigue manifests through multiple domains and negatively influences recovery. There is, however, currently no definition of fatigue contextualised to the unique characteristics of rugby (e.g., locomotor and collision loads). Similarly, the methods and metrics which practitioners consider when quantifying the components of post-match fatigue and subsequent recovery are not known. The aims of this study were to develop a definition of fatigue in rugby, to determine agreement with this common definition of fatigue, and to outline which methods and metrics are considered important and feasible to implement to quantify post-match fatigue. Subject matter experts (SME) undertook a two-round online Delphi questionnaire (round one; n = 42, round two; n = 23). SME responses in round one were analysed to derive a definition of fatigue, which after discussion and agreement by the investigators, obtained 96% agreement in round two. The SME agreed that fatigue in rugby refers to a reduction in performance-related task ability which is underpinned by time-dependent negative changes within and between cognitive, neuromuscular, perceptual, physiological, emotional, and technical/tactical domains. Further, there were 33 items in the neuromuscular performance, cardio-autonomic, or self-report domains achieved consensus for importance and/or feasibility to implement. Highly rated methods and metrics included countermovement jump force/power (neuromuscular performance), heart rate variability (cardio-autonomic measures), and soreness, mood, stress, and sleep quality (self-reported assessments). A monitoring system including highly-rated fatigue monitoring objective and subjective methods and metrics in rugby is presented. Practical recommendations of objective and subjective measures, and broader considerations for testing and analysing the resulting data in relation to monitoring fatigue are provided.",

These memories have an even more positive emotional profile than nostalgic memories elicited by other means, with individuals reporting lower levels of negative or ambivalent emotions.

      "title": "Linking Social Cognition to Learning and Memory.",
      "abstract": "Many mammals have evolved to be social creatures. In humans, the ability to learn from others' experiences is essential to survival; and from an early age, individuals are surrounded by a social environment that helps them develop a variety of skills, such as walking, talking, and avoiding danger. Similarly, in rodents, behaviors, such as food preference, exploration of novel contexts, and social approach, can be learned through social interaction. Social encounters facilitate new learning and help modify preexisting memories throughout the lifespan of an organism. Moreover, social encounters can help buffer stress or the effects of negative memories, as well as extinguish maladaptive behaviors. Given the importance of such interactions, there has been increasing work studying social learning and applying its concepts in a wide range of fields, including psychotherapy and medical sociology. The process of social learning, including its neural and behavioral mechanisms, has also been a rapidly growing field of interest in neuroscience. However, the term \"social learning\" has been loosely applied to a variety of psychological phenomena, often without clear definition or delineations. Therefore, this review gives a definition for specific aspects of social learning, provides an overview of previous work at the circuit, systems, and behavioral levels, and finally, introduces new findings on the social modulation of learning. We contextualize such social processes in the brain both through the role of the hippocampus and its capacity to process \"social engrams\" as well as through the brainwide realization of social experiences. With the integration of new technologies, such as optogenetics, chemogenetics, and calcium imaging, manipulating social engrams will likely offer a novel therapeutic target to enhance the positive buffering effects of social experiences or to inhibit fear-inducing social stimuli in models of anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

      "abstract": "Memories initially formed in hippocampus gradually stabilize to cortex over weeks-to-months for long-term storage. The mechanistic details of this brain re-organization remain poorly understood. We recorded bulk neural activity in circuits that link hippocampus and cortex as mice performed a memory-guided virtual-reality task over weeks. We identified a prominent and sustained neural correlate of memory in anterior thalamus, whose inhibition substantially disrupted memory consolidation. More strikingly, gain amplification enhanced consolidation of otherwise unconsolidated memories. To gain mechanistic insights, we developed a technology for simultaneous cellular-resolution imaging of hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex throughout consolidation. We found that whereas hippocampus equally encodes multiple memories, the anteromedial thalamus preferentially encodes salient memories, and gradually increases correlations with cortex to facilitate tuning and synchronization of cortical ensembles. We thus identify a thalamo-cortical circuit that gates memory consolidation and propose a mechanism suitable for the selection and stabilization of hippocampal memories into longer-term cortical storage.",

In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging system in mice to determine the epigenetic state, 3D genome architecture and transcriptional landscape of engram cells over the lifespan of memory formation and recall. Our findings reveal that memory encoding leads to an epigenetic priming event, marked by increased accessibility of enhancers without the corresponding transcriptional changes. Memory consolidation subsequently results in spatial reorganization of large chromatin segments and promoter-enhancer interactions. Finally, with reactivation, engram neurons use a subset of de novo long-range interactions, where primed enhancers are brought in contact with their respective promoters to upregulate genes involved in local protein translation in synaptic compartments. Collectively, our work elucidates the comprehensive transcriptional and epigenomic landscape across the lifespan of memory formation and recall in the hippocampal engram ensemble.",

      "abstract": "Memory recollections and voluntary actions are often perceived as spontaneously generated irrespective of external stimuli. Although products of our neurons, they are only rarely accessible in humans at the neuronal level. Here I review insights gleaned from unique neurosurgical opportunities to record and stimulate single-neuron activity in people who can declare their thoughts, memories and wishes. I discuss evidence that the subjective experience of human recollection and that of voluntary action arise from the activity of two internal neuronal generators, the former from medial temporal lobe reactivation and the latter from frontoparietal preactivation. I characterize properties of these generators and their interaction, enabling flexible recruitment of memory-based choices for action as well as recruitment of action-based plans for the representation of conceptual knowledge in memories. Both internal generators operate on surprisingly explicit but different neuronal codes, which appear to arise with distinct single-neuron activity, often observed before participants' reports of conscious awareness. I discuss prediction of behaviour based on these codes, and the potential for their modulation. The prospects of editing human memories and volitions by enhancement, inception or deletion of specific, selected content raise therapeutic possibilities and ethical concerns.",

      "abstract": "Enhanced gamma oscillatory activity (30-80 Hz) accompanies the successful formation and retrieval of episodic memories. While this co-occurrence is well documented, the mechanistic contributions of gamma oscillatory activity to episodic memory remain unclear. Here, we review how gamma oscillatory activity may facilitate spike timing-dependent plasticity, neural communication, and sequence encoding/retrieval, thereby ensuring the successful formation and/or retrieval of an episodic memory. Based on the evidence reviewed, we propose that multiple, distinct forms of gamma oscillation can be found within the canonical gamma band, each of which has a complementary role in the neural processes listed above. Further exploration of these theories using causal manipulations may be key to elucidating the relevance of gamma oscillatory activity to episodic memory.",

      "abstract": "Remote memory usually decreases over time, whereas remote drug-cue associated memory exhibits enhancement, increasing the risk of relapse during abstinence. Memory system consolidation is a prerequisite for remote memory formation, but neurobiological underpinnings of the role of consolidation in the enhancement of remote drug memory are unclear. Here, we found that remote cocaine-cue associated memory was enhanced in rats that underwent self-administration training, together with a progressive increase in the response of prelimbic cortex (PrL) CaMKII neurons to cues. System consolidation was required for the enhancement of remote cocaine memory through PrL CaMKII neurons during the early period post-training. Furthermore, dendritic spine maturation in the PrL relied on the basolateral amygdala (BLA) input during the early period of consolidation, contributing to remote memory enhancement. These findings indicate that memory consolidation drives the enhancement of remote cocaine memory through a time-dependent increase in activity and maturation of PrL CaMKII neurons receiving a sustained BLA input.",

      "abstract": "How do passing moments turn into lasting memories? Sheltered from external tasks and distractions, sleep constitutes an optimal state for the brain to reprocess and consolidate previous experiences. Recent work suggests that consolidation is governed by the intricate interaction of slow oscillations (SOs), spindles, and ripples - electrophysiological sleep rhythms that orchestrate neuronal processing and communication within and across memory circuits. This review describes how sequential SO-spindle-ripple coupling provides a temporally and spatially fine-tuned mechanism to selectively strengthen target memories across hippocampal and cortical networks. Coupled sleep rhythms might be harnessed not only to enhance overnight memory retention, but also to combat memory decline associated with healthy ageing and neurodegenerative diseases.",

These experiences trigger synaptic plasticity and persistent structural and functional changes in neuronal synapses. Recently, cellular studies of memory storage and engrams have emerged over the last decade. Engram cells reflect interconnected neurons via modified synapses. However, we were unable to observe the structural changes arising from synaptic plasticity in the past, because it was not possible to distinguish the synapses between engram cells. To overcome this barrier, dual-eGRASP (enhanced green fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners) technology can label specific synapses among multiple synaptic ensembles. Selective labeling of engram synapses elucidated their role by observing the structural changes in synapses according to the memory state. Dual-eGRASP extends cellular level engram studies to introduce the era of synaptic level studies. Here, we review this concept and possible applications of the dual-eGRASP, including recent studies that provided visual evidence of structural plasticity at the engram synapse.",

During memory formation, experiences prompt the activation of a selected and sparse population of cells (engram cells) that undergo persistent physical and/or chemical changes allowing long-term memory formation, which can last for decades. Over the past few decades, important progress has been made on elucidating signaling mechanisms by which synaptic transmission leads to the induction of activity-dependent gene regulation programs during the different phases of learning (acquisition, consolidation, and recall). But what are the molecular mechanisms that govern the expression of immediate-early genes (IEGs; c-fos, Npas4) and plasticity-related genes (PRGs; Dlg4/PSD95 and Grin2b/NR2B) in memory ensemble?

      "abstract": "Autobiographical memories are never isolated episodes; they are embedded in a network that is continually updated and prediction driven. We present autobiographical memory as a meaning-driven process that includes both veridical traces and reconstructive schemas. Our developmental approach delineates how autobiographical memory develops across childhood and throughout adulthood, and our sociocultural approach examines the ways in which autobiographical memories are shaped by everyday social interactions embedded within cultural worldviews. These approaches are enhanced by a focus on autobiographical memory functions, namely self-coherence, social embeddedness, and directing future behaviors. Neuroscience models of memory outlined in multiple trace and trace transformation theories and perceptual principles of predictive processing establish mechanisms and frameworks into which autobiographical memory processes are incorporated. Rather than conceptualizing autobiographical and episodic memories as accurate versus error-prone, we frame memory as a dynamic process that is continuously updated to create coherent meaning for individuals living in complex sociocultural worlds. Autobiographical memory is a process of both accuracy and error, an intricate weaving of specific episodic details, inferences and confusions among similar experiences; it incorporates post-event information through reminiscing and conversations, in the service of creating more meaningful coherent memories that define self, others, and the world.

Extensive evidence indicates that the amygdala and its interactions with other cerebral regions play an important role in the memory-enhancing effect of emotional arousal. While the cerebellum has been found to be involved in fear conditioning, its role in emotional enhancement of episodic memory is less clear. To address this issue, we used a whole-brain functional MRI approach in 1,418 healthy participants. First, we identified clusters significantly activated during enhanced memory encoding of negative and positive emotional pictures. In addition to the well-known emotional memory-related cerebral regions, we identified a cluster in the cerebellum. We then used dynamic causal modeling and identified several cerebellar connections with increased connection strength corresponding to enhanced emotional memory, including one to a cluster covering the amygdala and hippocampus, and bidirectional connections with a cluster covering the anterior cingulate cortex. The present findings indicate that the cerebellum is an integral part of a network involved in emotional enhancement of episodic memory.",

      "abstract": "Stress can powerfully influence episodic memory, often enhancing memory encoding for emotionally salient information. These stress-induced memory enhancements stand at odds with demonstrations that stress and the stress-related hormone cortisol can negatively affect the hippocampus, a brain region important for episodic memory encoding. To resolve this apparent conflict and determine whether and how the hippocampus supports memory encoding under cortisol, we combined behavioral assays of associative memory, high-resolution fMRI, and pharmacological manipulation of cortisol in a within-participant, double-blinded procedure (in both sexes). Behaviorally, hydrocortisone promoted the encoding of subjectively arousing, positive associative memories. Neurally, hydrocortisone led to enhanced functional connectivity between hippocampal subregions, which predicted subsequent memory enhancements for emotional associations. Cortisol also modified the relationship between hippocampal representations and associative memory: whereas hippocampal signatures of distinctiveness predicted memory under placebo, relative integration predicted memory under cortisol. Together, these data provide novel evidence that the human hippocampus contains the necessary machinery to support emotional associative memory enhancements under cortisol.",

      "abstract": "Long-term memory manages its contents to facilitate adaptive behaviour, amplifying representations of information relevant to current goals and expediting forgetting of information that competes with relevant memory traces. Both mnemonic selection and inhibition maintain congruence between the contents of long-term memory and an organism's priorities. However, the capacity of these processes to modulate affective mnemonic representations remains ambiguous. Three empirical experiments investigated the consequences of mnemonic selection and inhibition on affectively charged and neutral mnemonic representations using an adapted retrieval practice paradigm. Participants encoded neutral cue words and affectively negative or neutral associates and then selectively retrieved a subset of these associates multiple times. The consequences of selection and inhibitory processes engaged during selective retrieval were evaluated on a final memory test in which recall for all studied associates was probed. Analyses of memory recall indicated that both affectively neutral and negative mnemonic representations experienced similar levels of enhancement and impairment following selective retrieval, demonstrating the susceptibility of affectively salient memories to these mnemonic processes. These findings indicate that although affective memories may be more strongly encoded in memory, they remain amenable to inhibition and flexibly adaptable to the evolving needs of the organism.",

      "abstract": "Extensive evidence indicates that noradrenergic activation is essentially involved in mediating the enhancing effects of emotional arousal on memory consolidation. Our current understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the memory-modulatory effects of the noradrenergic system is primarily based on pharmacological studies in rats, employing targeted administration of noradrenergic drugs into specific brain regions. However, the further delineation of the specific neural circuitry involved would benefit from experimental tools that are currently more readily available in mice. Previous studies have not, as yet, investigated the effect of noradrenergic enhancement of memory in mice, which show different cognitive abilities and higher endogenous arousal levels induced by a training experience compared to rats. In the present study, we investigated the effect of posttraining noradrenergic activation in male C57BL/6J mice on the consolidation of object recognition and object location memory. We found that the noradrenergic stimulant yohimbine (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg) administered systemically immediately after an object training experience dose-dependently enhanced 24-h memory of both the identity and location of the object. Thus, these findings indicate that noradrenergic activation also enhances memory consolidation processes in mice, paving the way for a systematic investigation of the neural circuitry underlying these emotional arousal effects on memory.",

      "abstract": "Events associated with aversive or rewarding outcomes are prioritized in memory. This memory boost is commonly attributed to the elicited affective response, closely linked to noradrenergic and dopaminergic modulation of hippocampal plasticity. Herein we review and compare this 'affect' mechanism to an additional, recently discovered, 'prediction' mechanism whereby memories are strengthened by the extent to which outcomes deviate from expectations, that is, by prediction errors (PEs). The mnemonic impact of PEs is separate from the affective outcome itself and has a distinct neural signature. While both routes enhance memory, these mechanisms are linked to different - and sometimes opposing - predictions for memory integration. We discuss new findings that highlight mechanisms by which emotional events strengthen, integrate, and segment memory.",

      "abstract": "Episodic memory has a dynamic nature: when we recall past episodes, we retrieve not only their content, but also their temporal structure. The phenomenon of replay, in the hippocampus of mammals, offers a remarkable example of this temporal dynamics. However, most quantitative models of memory treat memories as static configurations, neglecting the temporal unfolding of the retrieval process. Here, we introduce a continuous attractor network model with a memory-dependent asymmetric component in the synaptic connectivity, which spontaneously breaks the equilibrium of the memory configurations and produces dynamic retrieval. The detailed analysis of the model with analytical calculations and numerical simulations shows that it can robustly retrieve multiple dynamical memories, and that this feature is largely independent of the details of its implementation. By calculating the storage capacity, we show that the dynamic component does not impair memory capacity, and can even enhance it in certain regimes.",

      "abstract": "Spatiotemporal context is an intrinsic aspect of episodic memory. Although a large literature has demonstrated that emotion enhances episodic memory, less research has considered whether and how emotion affects memory for the timing of an experience, despite theoretical and practical importance. In this review, we bridge three heavily researched cognitive domains - memory, emotion, and time - by discussing findings from a burgeoning literature on their intersection. We identify and review two broad ways in which memory for time has been conceptualised in the emotional memory literature, namely (1) memory for relative aspects of event timing (\"when\" an event detail occurred), which includes studies of temporal-order and source memory; and (2) memory for the time that elapsed during an event (\"how long\"), which includes studies of retrospective duration estimation. Emerging trends demonstrate that although temporal-order memory can be impaired or enhanced by emotion depending on study demands, temporal source memory, instead, is usually enhanced. Studies of duration memory show that the remembered duration of negative experiences is dilated, but it is less clear how duration memory is affected for positive events. These findings are considered under the lens of broader emotional memory literature theories, and directions for future research are proposed.",

      "abstract": "Threatening events and stressful experiences can lead to maladaptive memories and related behaviors. Existing treatments often fail to address these issues linked to anxiety/stress-related disorders effectively. This review identifies dose ranges associated with specific actions across various psychedelics. We examined psilocybin/psilocin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), mescaline, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), serotonin 2 A/2 C agonists (e.g., DOI) and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on aversive memory extinction and reconsolidation, learned fear, anxiety, and locomotion in rodents. Nearly 400 studies published since 1957 were reviewed. Psychedelics often show biphasic effects on locomotion at doses that enhance extinction learning/retention, impair memory reconsolidation, or reduce learned fear and anxiety. Emerging evidence suggests a dissociation between their prospective benefits and locomotor effects. Under-explored aspects include sex differences, susceptibility to interference as memories age and generalize, repeated treatments, and immediate vs. delayed changes. Validating findings in traumatic-like memory and maladaptive fear/anxiety models is essential. Understanding how psychedelics modulate threat responses and post-retrieval memory processes in rodents may inform drug development and human studies, improving therapeutic approaches for related psychiatric conditions.",

      "abstract": "When our experience violates our predictions, it is adaptive to update our knowledge to promote a more accurate representation of the world and facilitate future predictions. Theoretical models propose that these mnemonic prediction errors should be encoded into a distinct memory trace to prevent interference with previous, conflicting memories. We investigated this proposal by repeatedly exposing participants to pairs of sequentially presented objects (A → B), thus evoking expectations. Then, we violated participants' expectations by replacing the second object in the pairs with a novel object (A → C). The following item memory test required participants to discriminate between identical old items and similar lures, thus testing detailed and distinctive item memory representations. In two experiments, mnemonic prediction errors enhanced item memory: Participants correctly identified more old items as old when those items violated expectations during learning, compared with items that did not violate expectations. This memory enhancement for C items was only observed when participants later showed intact memory for the related A → B pairs, suggesting that strong predictions are required to facilitate memory for violations. Following up on this, a third experiment reduced prediction strength prior to violation and subsequently eliminated the memory advantage of violations. Interestingly, mnemonic prediction errors did not increase gist-based mistakes of identifying old items as similar lures or identifying similar lures as old. Enhanced item memory in the absence of gist-based mistakes suggests that violations enhanced memory for items' details, which could be mediated via distinct memory traces. Together, these results advance our knowledge of how mnemonic prediction errors promote memory formation.",

      "abstract": "Influential clinical theories propose that parts of traumatic or stressful events are stored in an unprocessed, purely perceptual form, which is inaccessible for voluntary retrieval but may spontaneously return to consciousness involuntarily in response to matching cues. This leads to perceptually vivid, and largely veridical involuntary memories of the traumatic scene, remembered with the original emotions and from the same vantage point as during the event. Several lines of evidence contradict this position. First, involuntary memories are not more veridical than memories retrieved deliberately. Second, involuntary memories for trauma-related events are not more frequently remembered with the original first-person perspective, and individuals with PTSD do not report more first-person involuntary memories than individuals without PTSD. Third, involuntary memories of stressful moments that are subjectively experienced as repetitive do not come to mind in a fixed and unchangeable form. Fourth, involuntary memories do not have privileged access to the most emotional moments (so-called hotspots) of a stressful event and the content and choice of hotspots change over time. Fourth, although involuntary memories are associated with enhanced emotional impact, this does not imply reactivation of the original emotion. We conclude that involuntary memories, although effortless, are products of (re)constructive processes.",

      "title": "Direct electrical brain stimulation of human memory: lessons learnt and future perspectives.",
      "abstract": "Modulation of cognitive functions supporting human declarative memory is one of the grand challenges of neuroscience, and of vast importance for a variety of neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases. Despite a recent surge of successful attempts at improving performance in a range of memory tasks, the optimal approaches and parameters for memory enhancement have yet to be determined. On a more fundamental level, it remains elusive as to how delivering electrical current in a given brain area leads to enhanced memory processing. Starting from the local and distal physiological effects on neural populations, the mechanisms of enhanced memory encoding, maintenance, consolidation or recall in response to direct electrical stimulation are only now being unravelled. With the advent of innovative neurotechnologies for concurrent recording and stimulation intracranially in the human brain, it becomes possible to study both acute and chronic effects of stimulation on memory performance and the underlying neural activities. In this review, we summarize the effects of various invasive stimulation approaches for modulating memory functions. We first outline the challenges that were faced in the initial studies of memory enhancement and the lessons learnt. Electrophysiological biomarkers are then reviewed as more objective measures of the stimulation effects than behavioural outcomes. Finally, we classify the various stimulation approaches into continuous and phasic modulation with an open or closed loop for responsive stimulation based on analysis of the recorded neural activities. Although the potential advantage of closed-loop responsive stimulation over the classic open-loop approaches is inconclusive, we foresee the emerging results from ongoing longitudinal studies and clinical trials will shed light on both the mechanisms and optimal strategies for improving declarative memory. Adaptive stimulation based on the biomarker analysis over extended periods of time is proposed as a future direction for obtaining lasting effects on memory functions. Chronic tracking and modulation of neural activities intracranially through adaptive stimulation opens tantalizing new avenues to continually monitor and treat memory and cognitive deficits in a range of brain disorders. Brain co-processors created with machine-learning tools and wireless bi-directional connectivity to seamlessly integrate implanted devices with smartphones and cloud computing are poised to enable real-time automated analysis of large data volumes and adaptively tune electrical stimulation based on electrophysiological biomarkers of behavioural states. Next-generation implantable devices for high-density recording and stimulation of electrophysiological activities, and technologies for distributed brain-computer interfaces are presented as selected future perspectives for modulating human memory and associated mental processes.",

Imprinted memories formed during the early developmental stage, unlike learning and memory, can last a lifetime. It is not clear whether these two types of memories are interlinked. In this study, we investigated whether imprinted memory influences adult learning and memory in a C. elegans model system. We trained the worms for short-term (STAM) and long-term associated memory (LTAM) towards butanone (BT) after conditioning them for imprinted memory towards isoamyl alcohol (IAA). We observed that these worms had improved learning abilities. However, functional imaging revealed that the worms had a long-term depression in the firing pattern in the AIY interneuron, indicating that there were significant changes in neuronal excitation pattern after imprinting, which could explain the enhanced behavioural alterations in animals after imprinting.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder with traumatic memories at its core. Post-treatment sleep may offer a unique time window to increase therapeutic efficacy through consolidation of therapeutically modified traumatic memories. Targeted memory reactivation (TMR) enhances memory consolidation by presenting reminder cues (e.g., sounds associated with a memory) during sleep. Here, we applied TMR in PTSD patients to strengthen therapeutic memories during sleep after one treatment session with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). PTSD patients received either slow oscillation (SO) phase-targeted TMR, using modeling-based closed-loop neurostimulation (M-CLNS) with EMDR clicks as a reactivation cue (n = 17), or sham stimulation (n = 16). Effects of TMR on sleep were assessed through high-density polysomnography. Effects on treatment outcome were assessed through subjective, autonomic, and fMRI responses to script-driven imagery (SDI) of the targeted traumatic memory and overall PTSD symptom level. Compared to sham stimulation, TMR led to stimulus-locked increases in SO and spindle dynamics, which correlated positively with PTSD symptom reduction in the TMR group. Given the role of SOs and spindles in memory consolidation, these findings suggest that TMR may have strengthened the consolidation of the EMDR-treatment memory. Clinically, TMR vs. sham stimulation resulted in a larger reduction of avoidance level during SDI. TMR did not disturb sleep or trigger nightmares. Together, these data provide first proof of principle that TMR may be a safe and viable future treatment augmentation strategy for PTSD. The required follow-up studies may implement multi-night TMR or TMR during REM sleep to further establish the clinical effect of TMR for traumatic memories.",

      "title": "Receive, Retain and Retrieve: Psychological and Neurobiological Perspectives on Memory Retrieval.",
      "abstract": "Memory and learning are interdependent processes that involve encoding, storage, and retrieval. Especially memory retrieval is a fundamental cognitive ability to recall memory traces and update stored memory with new information. For effective memory retrieval and learning, the memory must be stabilized from short-term memory to long-term memory. Hence, it is necessary to understand the process of memory retention and retrieval that enhances the process of learning. Though previous cognitive neuroscience research has focused on memory acquisition and storage, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying memory retrieval and its role in learning are less understood. Therefore, this article offers the viewpoint that memory retrieval is essential for selecting, reactivating, stabilizing, and storing information in long-term memory. In arguing how memories are retrieved, consolidated, transmitted, and strengthened for the long term, the article will examine the psychological and neurobiological aspects of memory and learning with synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation, genetic transcription, and theta oscillation in the brain.",

This contextual linking ensures enhanced access to those memories that are most relevant to the context at hand, including specific associations that were previously learned in that context. This principle, referred to as encoding specificity, predicts that context-specific neural states should bias retrieval of particular associations over others, potentially allowing for the disambiguation of retrieval cues that may have multiple associations or meanings. Using a context-odor paired associate learning paradigm in mice, here, we show that chemogenetic manipulation of dentate gyrus ensembles corresponding to specific contexts reinstates context-specific neural states in downstream CA1 and biases retrieval toward context-specific associations.",

      "abstract": "Music-assisted reminiscence therapy involves the use of music, in any form, to prompt and augment the recollection of autobiographical memories and therapeutic reframing of the meaning of one's life and experiences. The functions of music in reminiscence therapy remains unclear. Drawing on interdisciplinary research in music therapy, psychology, sociology, gerontology, and neuroscience, this paper proposes a theoretical model for understanding the multiple functions of music when used in reminiscence therapy, and describes how music-assisted reminiscence therapy might be used to improve the wellbeing of older people. The SEED model proposes that music, when used together with reminiscence interventions, helps to: 1) summon autobiographical memories; 2) evoke strong emotional reactions; 3) elicit physiological responses; and 4) define identity. Evidence for the four proposed functions of music in reminiscence interventions is presented. The SEED model expands on previous research and theory on music and reminiscence, neural and cognitive processing, and the therapeutic use of music. The SEED model maps the benefits and indicators for the use of music in reminiscence therapy and provides a blueprint for research to test the purported benefits of using music to enhance reminiscence therapy.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe psychiatric disorder in which traumatic memories result in flashbacks and nightmares. With one-third of patients not responding to standard exposure-based psychotherapy, new treatment strategies are needed. Sleep offers a unique time window to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Traumatic memories that are neutralized in therapy need to be stored back into memory (consolidated) during sleep to solidify the treatment effect. New basic research shows that memory consolidation can be enhanced by presenting sounds or scents that were linked to the memory at encoding, again during sleep. This procedure, termed targeted memory reactivation (TMR), has, despite its clinical potential, not been tested in (PTSD) patients. In this narrative review, we explore the potential of TMR as a new sleep-based treatment for PTSD. First we provide the necessary background on the memory and sleep principles underlying PTSD as well as the present applications and conditional factors of TMR. Then, we will discuss the outstanding questions and most promising experimental avenues when testing TMR to treat traumatic memories.",

      "title": "How Psychedelics Modulate Multiple Memory Mechanisms in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder with defining abnormalities in memory, and psychedelics may be promising candidates for the treatment of PTSD given their effects on multiple memory systems. Most PTSD and psychedelic research has investigated memory with fear conditioning and extinction. While fruitful, conditioning and extinction provide a limited model of the complexity of PTSD and phenomenology of psychedelics, thereby limiting the refinement of therapies. In this review, we discuss abnormalities in fear conditioning and extinction in PTSD and review 25 studies testing psychedelics on these forms of memory. Perhaps the most reliable effect is that the acute effects of psychedelics can enhance extinction learning, which is impaired in PTSD. However, the post-acute effects may also enhance extinction learning, and the acute effects can also enhance fear conditioning. We then discuss abnormalities in episodic and semantic memory in PTSD and review current knowledge on how psychedelics impact these memory systems. Although PTSD and psychedelics acutely impair the formation of hippocampal-dependent episodic memories, psychedelics may acutely enhance cortical-dependent learning of semantic memories that could facilitate the integration of trauma memories and disrupt maladaptive beliefs. More research is needed on the acute effects of psychedelics on episodic memory consolidation, retrieval, and reconsolidation and post-acute effects of psychedelics on all phases of episodic memory. We conclude by discussing how targeting multiple memory mechanisms could improve upon the current psychedelic therapy paradigm for PTSD, thereby necessitating a greater emphasis on assessing diverse measures of memory in translational PTSD and psychedelic research.",

      "abstract": "A large body of research illustrates the prioritization of goal-relevant information in memory; however, it is unclear how reward-related memories are organized. Using a rewarded free recall paradigm, we investigated how reward motivation structures the organization of memory around temporal and higher-order contexts. To better understand these processes, we simulated our findings using a reward-modulated variant of the Context Maintenance and Retrieval Model (CMR; Polyn et al., 2009). In the first study, we found that reward did not influence temporal clustering, but instead shifted the organization of memory based on reward category. Further, we showed that a reward-modulated learning rate and source features of CMR most accurately depict reward's enhancement on memory and clustering by value. In a second study, we showed that reward-memory effects can exist in both extended periods of sustained motivation and frequent changes in motivation, by showing equivalent reward effects using mixed- and pure-list motivation manipulations. However, we showed that a reward-modulated learning rate in isolation can support reward's enhancement of memory in pure-list contexts. Overall, we conclude that reward-related memories are adaptively organized by higher-order value information, and contextual binding to value contexts may only be necessary when rewards are intermittent versus sustained.",

However, in some cases information that is initially irrelevant can become relevant at a later time. The question arises whether and to what extent the memory system can retroactively boost memories of the initially irrelevant information. Experimental studies in animals and humans have provided evidence for such retroactive memory boosting. Additionally, these studies suggest that retroactive memory enhancement (RME) can be selective to the semantic meaning of the material. Nonetheless, recent experimental work could not replicate these findings, posing the question whether the selective RME effect is reliable. To synthesize the available evidence, we conducted meta-analyses of 14 experiments. Although the classical meta-analytic procedure suggested a small selective RME effect, Cohen's d",

Intrusive memories and flashbacks after trauma are prominent in several mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and can persist for years. Critically, the reduction of intrusive memories provides a treatment target. While cognitive and descriptive models for psychological trauma exist, these lack formal quantitative structure and robust empirical validation. Here, using techniques from stochastic process theory, we develop a mechanistically driven, quantitative framework to extend understanding of the temporal dynamic processes of trauma memory. Our approach is to develop a probabilistic description of memory mechanisms to link to the broader goals of trauma treatment. We show how the marginal gains of treatments for intrusive memories can be enhanced as key properties (intervention strength and reminder strength) of the intervention and memory consolidation (probability memories are labile) vary. Parametrizing the framework with empirical data highlights that while emerging interventions to reduce occurrence of intrusive memories can be effective, counterintuitively, ",

      "abstract": "Fake news can have enduring effects on memory and beliefs. An ongoing theoretical debate has investigated whether corrections (fact-checks) should include reminders of fake news. The familiarity backfire account proposes that reminders hinder correction (increasing interference), whereas integration-based accounts argue that reminders facilitate correction (promoting memory integration). In three experiments, we examined how different types of corrections influenced memory for and belief in news headlines. In the exposure phase, participants viewed real and fake news headlines. In the correction phase, participants viewed reminders of fake news that either reiterated the false details (complete) or prompted recall of missing false details (partial); reminders were followed by fact-checked headlines correcting the false details. Both reminder types led to proactive interference in memory for corrected details, but complete reminders produced less interference than partial reminders (Experiment 1). However, when participants had fewer initial exposures to fake news and experienced a delay between exposure and correction, this effect was reversed; partial reminders led to proactive facilitation, enhancing correction (Experiment 2). This effect occurred regardless of the delay before correction (Experiment 3), suggesting that the effects of partial reminders depend on the number of prior fake news exposures. In all experiments, memory and perceived accuracy were better when fake news and corrections were recollected, implicating a critical role for integrative encoding. Overall, we show that when memories of fake news are weak or less accessible, partial reminders are more effective for correction; when memories of fake news are stronger or more accessible, complete reminders are preferable.",

      "abstract": "The brain is designed not only with molecules and cellular processes that help to form memories but also with molecules and cellular processes that suppress the formation and retention of memory. The latter processes are critical for an efficient memory management system, given the vast amount of information that each person experiences in their daily activities and that most of this information becomes irrelevant with time. Thus, efficiency dictates that the brain should have processes for selecting the most critical information for storage and suppressing the irrelevant or forgetting it later should it escape the initial filters. Such memory suppressor molecules and processes are revealed by genetic or pharmacologic insults that lead to enhanced memory expression. We review here the predominant memory suppressor molecules and processes that have recently been discovered. They are diverse, as expected, because the brain is complex and employs many different strategies and mechanisms to form memories. They include the gene-repressive actions of small noncoding RNAs, repressors of protein synthesis, cAMP-mediated gene expression pathways, inter- and intracellular signaling pathways for normal forgetting, and others. A deep understanding of memory suppressor molecules and processes is necessary to fully comprehend how the brain forms, stabilizes, and retrieves memories and to reveal how brain disorders disrupt memory.",

      "abstract": "Illusions of inappropriate familiarity with the current experience or hallucinatory recall of memories are reported in temporal lobe seizures. Pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed, involving temporal limbic regions (Hughlings-Jackson), temporal neocortex (\"interpretive cortex\", Penfield), or both (Bancaud). Recent data acquired from presurgical investigations using intracerebral electrode recordings, demonstrate a critical role for the sub- and para-hippocampal cortices. From this, a novel hypothesis of cortico-limbic networks emerged: déjà-vu results from an abnormal synchronization between rhinal cortices and hippocampus, and reminiscences (\"dreamy state\") from activation of the associational function of the hippocampus in re-assembling elements of the past experience networks. \"Experiential\" phenomena are better scrutinized during direct cortical stimulation than during spontaneous occurrence, because it allows precise spatiotemporal correlations to be made between the illusion/hallucination and the electrical discharge features and localization. Therefore, we present a summary of the stimulation data published since Penfield's seminal studies, review the anatomical and physiological correlations of stimulation findings, and question their functional significance. We reappraise the distinct and coactive roles of the various regions involved in perception-memory processes including the hippocampus, rhinal cortices, temporal neocortex and constituent elements of the ventral stream. Additionally, we draw insights from what is known about the perception-cognition continuum underlying the construction of episodic memories. Finally, we compare the results from cortical stimulation in the epileptogenic zone with the use of stimulation for memory enhancement and explore what this reveals about the mechanisms of stimulation.",

Modifications of G-protein-coupled receptor pathways in CA1 astrocytes affect recent and remote recall in seemingly contradictory ways. To address this inconsistency, we manipulated these pathways in astrocytes during memory acquisition and tagged c-Fos-positive engram cells and CA1→ACC cells during recent and remote recall. The behavioral results were coupled with changes in the recruitment of CA1→ACC projection cells to the engram: Gq pathway activation in astrocytes caused enhancement of recent recall alone and was accompanied by earlier recruitment of CA1→ACC projecting cells to the engram. In contrast, Gi pathway activation in astrocytes resulted in the impairment of only remote recall, and CA1→ACC projecting cells were not recruited during remote memory. Finally, we provide a simple working model, hypothesizing that Gq and Gi pathway activation affect memory differently, by modulating the same mechanism: CA1→ACC projection.",

      "abstract": "Creative problem solving and memory are inherently intertwined: memory accesses existing knowledge while creativity enhances it. Recent studies show that insights often accompanying creative solutions enhance long-term memory. This insight memory advantage (IMA) is explained by the 'insight as prediction error (PE)' hypothesis which states that insights arise from PEs updating predictive solution models and thereby enhancing memory. Neurally, the hippocampus initially detects PEs and then, together with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), integrates and updates these expectations facilitating efficient memory encoding and retrieval. Dopamine (DA) mediates reward PEs and long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, while noradrenaline (NE) enhances arousal and attention impacting the amygdala, the salience network, and hippocampal plasticity. These neurobiological mechanisms likely underpin IMA and have significant implications for educational practices and problem-solving strategies.",

      "title": "Memory and attention: A double dissociation between memory encoding and memory retrieval.",
      "abstract": "Research has found substantial negative effects of divided attention (DA) during encoding but less substantial effects when attention is divided during retrieval, an asymmetry which has been interpreted as indicating that different control processes or forms of attention are involved in encoding and retrieval (e.g., Chun & Johnson, 2011; Craik, Govoni, Naveh-Benjamin, & Anderson, 1996; Long, Kuhl, & Chun, 2018). The extant evidence, however, is not strong support for qualitative differences and might simply indicate differential sensitivity. The present experiments document a stronger, double dissociation by focusing on the Attentional Boost Effect (ABE) - a phenomenon in which the detection of targets in a secondary task enhances encoding of co-occurring stimuli. The dual-task interaction account proposes that the classical negative effects produced by dual-task interference are offset by a transient increase in externally-directed attention brought about by target detection. Since externally-directed attention is less valuable for retrieval processes, the ABE should result in a net negative effect when applied in the test phase because the dual-task interference would no longer be offset by the externally-directed boost occurring during target trials. Experiments 1, 2 and 4 confirmed the predictions by showing that test words paired with target stimuli were recognized significantly worse than test words paired with distractor stimuli. In contrast, Experiments 3 and 4 replicated the usual positive effects of the ABE with respect to encoding. We discuss these findings in light of recent theoretical proposals suggesting that encoding and retrieval processes are subserved by different forms of attention (external [perceptual] vs. internal [reflective]). Implications for the Transfer-Appropriate-Processing view of memory are also illustrated.",

In this review, we collect the surprisingly sparse evidence on remote fear memory attenuation from both animal and human research. What is becoming apparent is twofold: although remote fear memories are more resistant to change compared with recent ones, they can nevertheless be attenuated when interventions are targeted toward the period of memory malleability instigated by memory recall, the reconsolidation window. We describe the physiological mechanisms underlying remote reconsolidation-updating approaches and highlight how they can be enhanced through interventions promoting synaptic plasticity. By capitalizing on an intrinsically relevant phase of memory, reconsolidation-updating harbors the potential to permanently alter remote fear memories.",

To enhance research on and clinical impacts of this model, the current review provides critical considerations for the Positive Memory-PTSD model. Drawing from emerging research and clinical observations, we (i) clarify that the model addresses specific versus overgeneral positive memories; (ii) underscore the importance of considering the heterogeneity in, and transitionary nature of, affect processes following positive memory retrieval; and (iii) highlight the rationale for considering trauma type/count and co-occurring conditions, as potential moderators of relations between positive memory processing and PTSD.

      "abstract": "Digital eye strain (DES) is an entity encompassing visual and ocular symptoms arising due to the prolonged use of digital electronic devices. It is characterized by dry eyes, itching, foreign body sensation, watering, blurring of vision, and headache. Non-ocular symptoms associated with eye strain include stiff neck, general fatigue, headache, and backache. A variable prevalence ranging from 5 to 65% has been reported in the pre-COVID-19 era. With lockdown restrictions during the pandemic, outdoor activities were restricted for all age groups, and digital learning became the norm for almost 2 years. While the DES prevalence amongst children alone rose to 50-60%, the symptoms expanded to include recent onset esotropia and vergence abnormalities as part of the DES spectrum. New-onset myopia and increased progression of existing myopia became one of the most significant ocular health complications. Management options for DES include following correct ergonomics like reducing average daily screen time, frequent blinking, improving lighting, minimizing glare, taking regular breaks from the screen, changing focus to distance object intermittently, and following the 20-20-20 rule to reduce eye strain. Innovations in this field include high-resolution screens, inbuilt antireflective coating, matte-finished glass, edge-to-edge displays, and image smoothening graphic effects. Further explorations should focus on recommendations for digital screen optimization, novel spectacle lens technologies, and inbuilt filters to optimize visual comfort. A paradigm shift is required in our understanding of looking at DES from an etiological perspective, so that customized solutions can be explored accordingly. The aim of this review article is to understand the pathophysiology of varied manifestations, predisposing risk factors, varied management options, along with changing patterns of DES prevalence post COVID-19.",

DES is present in at least 50% of regular users of digital media and is defined by blurred vision, difficulty focusing, ocular irritation or burning, dry eye, visual fatigue, headaches and increased sensitivity to light. Exposure time, age, female gender, and work environment are the main factors increasing its prevalence. Its pathophysiology, still poorly understood, is felt to be multifactorial and includes disturbances in the accommodative-convergence balance and changes in the ocular surface. Regarding accommodation and convergence, the studies are mostly old and their results heterogeneous. Conversely, many studies have shown an increase in the prevalence of dry eye in screen users. Although the retinal toxicity of blue light has been proven in in vitro models, the low level of evidence in the available studies does not allow it to be clearly correlated with the symptoms of DES. The objective of this review is to condense the knowledge available in the literature on the symptoms, prevalence, pathophysiology and management of DES.",

      "abstract": "Eye strain when performing tasks reliant on a digital environment can cause discomfort, affecting productivity and quality of life. Digital eye strain (the preferred terminology) was defined as \"the development or exacerbation of recurrent ocular symptoms and/or signs related specifically to digital device screen viewing\". Digital eye strain prevalence of up to 97% has been reported, due to no previously agreed definition/diagnostic criteria and limitations of current questionnaires which fail to differentiate such symptoms from those arising from non-digital tasks. Objective signs such as blink rate or critical flicker frequency changes are not 'diagnostic' of digital eye strain nor validated as sensitive. The mechanisms attributed to ocular surface disease exacerbation are mainly reduced blink rate and completeness, partial/uncorrected refractive error and/or underlying binocular vision anomalies, together with the cognitive demand of the task and differences in position, size, brightness and glare compared to an equivalent non-digital task. In general, interventions are not well established; patients experiencing digital eye strain should be provided with a full refractive correction for the appropriate working distances. Improving blinking, optimizing the work environment and encouraging regular breaks may help. Based on current, best evidence, blue-light blocking interventions do not appear to be an effective management strategy. More and larger clinical trials are needed to assess artificial tear effectiveness for relieving digital eye strain, particularly comparing different constituents; a systematic review within the report identified use of secretagogues and warm compress/humidity goggles/ambient humidifiers as promising strategies, along with nutritional supplementation (such as omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and berry extracts).",

      "abstract": "Migraine headaches are a debilitating condition that affects approximately 1% of the US population. Goals of migraine prophylaxis include reduction in headache severity and frequency, improved response to acute treatment, fewer days with disability, improvement in quality of life, and empowerment of patients with a sense of control over the condition. Indications for consideration of preventive therapy include frequent headaches, failure of or contraindication to acute treatments, overuse of acute treatments, and patient preference. First-line medications include propranolol, metoprolol, topiramate, divalproex, valproate, and calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. However, use of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists is limited by cost and insurance coverage. Amitriptyline and venlafaxine are considered second-line medications due to a greater number of adverse events and less supporting evidence, respectively. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) injection is approved for chronic migraine prophylaxis. It is as effective as other medications, is well tolerated, and has lower discontinuation rates than other drugs. Common migraine triggers include alcohol, anxiety, dehydration, excessive caffeine, eye strain, hunger, sleep deprivation, and stress. Physicians should recommend identification and management of migraine triggers. Cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, neural stimulators, and exercise are supported by varying levels of evidence and can be used individually or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Alternative agents, including feverfew, magnesium, and melatonin, have shown effectiveness and are generally well tolerated.",

It is caused by screen-related, environmental, ergonomic, and physiological factors, affecting diverse demographics. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly amplified CVS due to increased screen time for remote work, online learning, and social media use, with studies reporting symptoms in up to 74% of individuals. Unique visual challenges from digital screens, including reduced clarity and glare, exacerbate symptoms like dry eyes and discomfort, especially in those with uncorrected vision. Understanding CVS is crucial for mitigating its impact through effective prevention and management strategies. This study explores the causes, diagnosis, management, and prevention strategies of CVS by synthesizing recent findings from optometry, occupational health, digital health, and ergonomics. It also highlights emerging trends such as AI, wearables, and augmented reality while providing practical management strategies. A narrative review of literature from 2014 to 2024 was conducted, focusing on PubMed-indexed, peer-reviewed articles, including meta-analyses and systematic reviews, with priority given to recent, highly cited studies.",

      "abstract": "Computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a very common phenomenon amongst computer users. A total of 90% of computer users, who spend more than 3 hours a day in front of the computer screen, suffer from CVS. CVS is also known as digital eye strain or visual fatigue and includes symptoms that are a result of continuous work in front of the different types of computer screens or other types of digital screens. An updated differentiation divides the cause of the symptoms into three separate categories which include visual symptoms, symptoms resulting from the digital screen itself and symptoms resulting from the ocular surface. CVS includes a wide range of symptoms which are non-specific (asthenopia), which include eye fatigue, eye strain, pain in and around the eye, blurred vision, headaches and even diplopia (double vision). Asthenopia and dry eye are the core symptoms of CVS. There are many solutions and ways to treat the different symptoms related to the vision, the screen and ocular surface and especially the symptoms related to the issue of dry eye. The treatment of CVS is focused around the different groups of symptoms and it is recommended to give a combined treatment for all the symptomatic groups. The correction of residual astigmatism, accommodation issues, base-in or base-up prisms and the correction of vergence reserves to maintain vision aspects. Changing the lighting, correct positioning of the screen and correcting the direction of gaze in relation to symptoms which are connected to the screen and artificial tears, as well as increasing the blink rate and increasing the level of moisture of the air in the room, all assist in treating the symptoms of dry eye. Blue light also has some effect on CVS and as a precaution it is recommended to reduce, as much as possible, blue light radiation that enters the eye or is emitted from the computer screen.",

      "abstract": "Metformin, an insulin-sensitizer, is used in the treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in obese women as it helps in weight loss and regularizes the menstrual cycle. However, impaired absorption of Vitamin B12 due to metformin has also been hypothesized. Here, we report the case of a 39-year-old woman prescribed metformin for PCOS, presenting with an unusual symptom of eyelid myokymia. She developed distressing unilateral eyelid twitching, not responsive to conservative management or oral methylcobalamin. She was a nonsmoker, nonalcoholic, and nor caffeine-abuser. Other confounding factors such as stress, sleep deprivation, or eye strain were not evident. The only significant finding was borderline low Vitamin B12 levels. The symptoms subsided on discontinuation of metformin and reappeared when metformin was reintroduced. Although eyelid myokymia is a self-limiting benign condition, it can also be triggered by drugs and affect the quality of life. Practitioners should monitor Vitamin B12 levels during metformin therapy to prevent adverse effects.",

This term is gradually replacing the older term computer vision syndrome (CVS) that focused on the same symptoms found on personal computer users. DES is encountered more frequently during the past years due to the explosive increase in the usage of digital devices and subsequent increase in time in front of any screens. It presents with a series of atypical symptoms and signs stemming from asthenopia, dry eye syndrome, preexisting untreated vision issues and poor screen ergonomics. This review summarizes research data to date to determine whether the concept of DES has been conclusively defined and demarcated as a separate entity and if sufficient guidance is offered on professionals and the lay public. The maturity of the field, grouping of symptoms, examination techniques, treatment and prevention modalities are summarily presented.",

      "title": "Pseudomyopia and Its Association With Anxiety.",
      "abstract": "Pseudomyopia is an inappropriately excessive accommodation of the eye due to overstimulation or ciliary spasm, which leads to a marked approximation of the far point. Common symptoms of pseudomyopia include eye strain or fatigue, and it is classified as organic or functional. The latter is due to eye strain and functional increase in the ciliary tonus. Pseudomyopia can vary from being a transient condition or continue to progress to myopia. Head trauma is the most common cause followed by psychiatric illnesses, neurologic diseases, and drug-induced causes. There is an association between psychological stress-inducing events and pseudomyopia as it affects the autonomic nervous system. The human body counteracts anxiety by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, causing ciliary muscle contraction. Underlying psychiatric diseases in pseudomyopia patients have been reported in the past in multiple studies. Generalized anxiety disorder is the most common psychiatric illness associated with pseudomyopia with a positive correlation between anxiety-somatization scores and accommodation amount of the eye. It is strongly advised that a psychiatric consultation should be included in the multidisciplinary evaluation of every case. If patients have coexisting anxiety disorders, a multidisciplinary approach using psychiatric consultations, work environment changes, ocular exercises, and cycloplegic drugs can be used. This review aims to shed light on the association of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety with pseudomyopia.",

      "abstract": "Prosopometamorphopsia is an extremely rare disorder of visual perception characterised by facial distortions. We here review 81 cases (eight new ones and 73 cases published over the past century) to shed light on the perception of face gestalts. Our analysis indicates that the brain systems underlying the perception of face gestalts have genuine network properties, in the sense that they are widely disseminated and built such that spatially normal perception of faces can be maintained even when large parts of the network are compromised. We found that bilateral facial distortions were primarily associated with right-sided and bilateral occipital lesions, and unilateral facial distortions with lesions ipsilateral to the distorted hemifield and with the splenium of the corpus callosum. We also found tentative evidence for the involvement of the left frontal regions in the fusing of vertical hemi-images of faces, and of right parietal regions in the fusing of horizontal hemi-images. Evidence supporting the remarkable adaptability of the network comes from the relatively high recovery rates that we found, from the ipsilateral hemifield predominance of hemi-prosopometamorphopsia, and from a phenomenon called cerebral asthenopia (heightened visual fatigability) which points to the dynamic nature of compensatory mechanisms maintaining normal face perception, even in chronic cases of prosopometamorphopsia. Finally, our analysis suggests that specialised networks for the representation of face gestalts in familiar-versus-unfamiliar faces and for own-versus-other face may be present, although this is in need of further study.",

Other ergonomic factors relating to visualisation include stereo-acuity, vergence-accommodation mismatch, visual-perception mismatch, visual-vestibular mismatch, visuospatial ability, visual fatigue, and visual feedback to compensate for lack of haptic feedback. Visual fatigue symptoms may be related to dry eye or accommodative/binocular vision stress. Digital eye strain can be measured by questionnaires and objective tests. Management options include treatment of dry eye, correction of refractive error, and management of accommodation and vergence anomalies. Experienced robotic surgeons can use visual cues like tissue deformation and surgical tool information as surrogates for haptic feedback.",

      "abstract": "There has been a high prevalence of digital eye strain (DES) among students who have received distance-learning lessons due to COVID-19. However, in low- and middle-income countries, there are few studies that have analyzed its associated factors. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of DES and its associated factors among nursing students during COVID-19 distance learning. This was a cross-sectional analytical study conducted between May and June 2021 in six Peruvian universities. The sample comprised 796 nursing students. DES was measured using the Computer Vision Syndrome Questionnaire (CVS-Q). A bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. DES was found in 87.6% of nursing students. Sitting upright (OR, 0.47; 95% IC, 0.30-0.74), using electronic devices for more than four hours a day (OR, 1.73; 95% IC, 1.02-2.86), not following the 20-20-20 rule (OR, 2.60; 95% IC, 1.25-5.20), having the screen brightness very high (OR, 3.36; 95% IC, 1.23-11.8), and not wearing glasses (OR, 0.59; 95% IC, 0.37-0.93) are factors associated with DES. The prevalence of DES among nursing students is high. Improving the ergonomics of study environments, reducing the time of exposure to electronic devices, adjusting the screen brightness, and taking eye-care measures are key to controlling computer vision syndrome in virtual learning.",

      "abstract": "Hyperopia is a refractive error in which light is focused behind, instead of on, the retina. Clear vision can be obtained by accommodation, but in the long run, this results in eye strain. Hyperopia can be classified as low [≤2.00 diopters (D)], moderate (2.00-4.00 D) and high (>4.00 D). Detailed preoperative evaluation is necessary and essential to obtain good postoperative results. Various surgical techniques can be proposed to correct this ametropia. The main techniques used act either by modifying the corneal curvature with the Excimer laser or by implanting a phakic intraocular lens. The anatomical peculiarities of the hyperopic eye (small corneal diameter, short axial length, narrow anterior chamber or large kappa angle) make refractive surgery for hyperopia a considerable challenge. Large optical ablation zones now allow correction of high hyperopia by reducing the risks of optical aberrations and regression. The patient must be informed and understand the postoperative course, which differs from that of surgery for myopia.",

      "title": "The Prevalence and Knowledge of Digital Eye Strain Among the Undergraduates in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "abstract": "Aim/background Digital eye strain, also called computer vision syndrome (CVS), is a group of symptoms resulting from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader, and cell phone use. The level of discomfort and the severity of these symptoms appear to increase with the amount of digital screen use. These symptoms include eyestrain, headaches, blurred vision, and dry eyes. This study aims to assess the changes in the prevalence of digital eye strain among college students in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students at different college institutions in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Subjects were interviewed, and the data were collected using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was composed of student demographic data, students' general knowledge and risk perception of digital eye strain, and the assessment of CVS symptoms questionnaire. Results Of the 364 university students, 55.5% were females, and 96.2% were aged between 18 and 29 years. A significant proportion of university students (84.6%) were using digital devices for five hours or more. The proportion of university students who were aware of the 20-20-20 rule was 37.4%. The overall prevalence of positive for CVS symptoms was 76.1%. Independent risk factors for CVS symptoms were gender female, ocular disorders, and using digital devices at a shorter distance. Conclusion There was a high prevalence of CVS symptoms among university students in our region. Female students with an ocular disease were more likely to exhibit CVS symptoms than other university students, but using a digital device at a longer distance could alleviate the symptoms of CVS. A longitudinal study is needed to establish the effect of CVS symptoms among university students, especially during the post-pandemic era.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: This study investigates the impact of digital device usage on the visual system, with a focus on binocular vision. It also highlights the importance of objective assessment in accurately diagnosing and guiding therapeutic approaches for Digital Eye Strain Syndrome (DESS). (2) Methods: A comprehensive narrative review was conducted to synthesize existing evidence. The methodological quality of observational and case-control studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB 2) tool. (3) Results: Fifteen articles were included in this review, with a predominant focus on binocular vision anomalies, particularly accommodative and vergence dysfunctions, as well as ocular surface anomalies related to DESS. Clinical assessments relied primarily on symptom-based questionnaires, which represent a significant limitation. The included studies were largely observational, with a lack of longitudinal and RCTs. In contrast, research in dry eye disease has been more comprehensive, with multiple RCTs already conducted. (4) Therefore, it is essential to develop validated objective metrics that support accurate clinical diagnosis and guide evidence-based interventions. Conclusions: It remains unclear whether changes in binocular vision are a cause or consequence of DESS. However, prolonged screen time can exacerbate pre-existing binocular vision anomalies due to continuous strain on convergence and accommodation, leading to symptoms. Future research should prioritize prospective longitudinal studies and well-designed RCTs that integrate objective clinical measures to elucidate causal relationships and improve diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Digital eye strain (DES) is a growing occupational and public health problem and one of the most frequent reasons for seeking medical care. The objectives of this study are to identify the prevalence and to study some associated personal, ergonomic, and environmental factors of DES among information technology (IT) professionals at Tanta University, Egypt. An interview questionnaire was used to collect data related to socio-demographic, job, ergonomic and environmental characteristics. Computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) was used for the assessment of DES. It was used to measure ocular and visual symptoms related to computer use. CVS-Q includes 16 symptoms that are scored using two rating scales, one for frequency and the other for intensity. A total of 108 IT professionals were included. Prevalence of DES was 82.41%. The most common symptoms were headache (81.5%), burning of the eye (75.9%), and blurred vision (70.4%). Significant predictors of DES were female gender (OR = 2.845), age ≥ 35 years (OR = 1.112), daily computer use more than 6 h (OR = 1.351), duration of work more than 10 years (OR = 1.793), wearing corrective glasses (OR = 5.009), distance from the monitor less than 20 in. (OR = 4.389), not using antiglare screen (OR = 0.214), no brightness adjustment of screen (OR = 0.015), not taking break time during computer work (OR = 0.007), exposure to air pollution (OR = 5.667), use of the air conditioner (OR = 23.021), and exposure to windy environments (OR = 3.588). Prevalence of DES was found to be high among IT professionals. Significant predictors of DES were female gender, older age, wearing eyeglasses, long duration of computer use, unadjusted ergonomic workstation, and dry environment. DES is a problem that can be prevented by increasing knowledge and awareness about DES by providing computer users with eye health education, periodic training on a proper ergonomic computer workstation, and adjustment of the suitable comfortable workplace environment.",

      "abstract": "Digital eye strain (DES) or computer vision syndrome (CVS) is a phenomenon linked to ever increasing digital screen use globally, affecting a large number of individuals. Recognizing causative and alleviating factors of DES may help establish appropriate policies. We aimed to review factors that aggravate or alleviate DES symptoms in young, i.e. pre-presbyopic (< 40 years old), digital device users. We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane, Trip Database, and grey literature up to 1st July 2021. Among a plethora of studies with heterogeneous diagnostic criteria for DES, we only included those using a validated questionnaire for the diagnosis and evaluating associated factors in young subjects. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias assessment of the included studies and GRADE evaluation of each outcome were performed. Ten studies were included (five interventional, five observational) involving 2365 participants. Evidence coming from studies with moderate risk of bias suggested that blue-blocking filters do not appear to prevent DES (2 studies, 130 participants), while use of screens for > 4-5 h/day (2 studies, 461 participants) and poor ergonomic parameters during screen use (1 study, 200 participants) are associated with higher DES symptoms' score. GRADE evaluation for the outcomes of blue-blocking filters and duration of screen use showed low to moderate quality of evidence. It appears advisable to optimize ergonomic parameters and restrict screen use duration, for minimizing DES symptoms. Health professionals and policy makers may consider recommending such practices for digital screen users at work or leisure. There is no evidence for use of blue-blocking filters.",

An increased global dependence on VDTs has led to a rise in associated visual complaints, including eye strain, ocular dryness, burning, blurred vision, and irritation, to name a few. The principal causes for VDT-associated visual discomfort are abnormalities with oculomotor/vergence systems and dry eye (DE). This review focuses on the latter, as advances in research have identified symptomology and ocular surface parameters that are shared between prolonged VDT users and DE, particularly the evaporative subtype. Several mechanisms have been implicated in VDT-associated DE, including blink anomalies, damaging light emission from modern devices, and inflammatory changes. The presence of preexisting DE has also been explored as an inciting and exacerbating factor. We review the associations between digital screens and DE, mechanisms of damage, and therapeutic options, hoping to raise awareness of this entity with the goal of reducing the global morbidity and economic impact of screen-associated visual disability.",

      "abstract": "Digital eye strain is a complex, multifactorial condition that can be caused by excessive screen time exposure to various electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and computers. Current literature suggests oxidative damage concomitant with a chronic pro-inflammatory state represent significant etiopathogenic mechanisms. The present review aims to discuss the potential dietary role for micronutrients with nutraceutical properties to ameliorate various ocular and vision-related symptoms associated with digital eye strain. For ocular surface dysfunction, enhanced anti-inflammatory benefits with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been well documented for treatment of dry eye disease. The anti-oxidative and immunosuppressive properties of anthocyanin phytochemicals may also confer protective effects against visually induced cognitive stress and digital asthenopia. Meanwhile, nutraceutical strategies involving xanthophyll macular carotenoids demonstrate enhanced cognitive functioning and overall visual performance that aids digital eye strain. Collectively, preliminary findings seem to offer a strong line of evidence to substantiate the need for additional randomized controlled trials aimed at treating digital eye strain with adjunctive nutraceutical strategies. Further RCT and comparisons on commercially available nutritional supplements are needed to quantify the clinical benefits.",

      "abstract": "It is important to be able to measure the range of clear focus in clinical practice to advise on presbyopia correction techniques and to optimise the correction power. Both subjective and objective techniques are necessary: subjective techniques (such as patient reported outcome questionnaires and defocus curves) assess the impact of presbyopia on a patient and how the combination of residual objective accommodation and their natural DoF work for them; objective techniques (such as autorefraction, corneal topography and lens imaging) allow the clinician to understand how well a technique is working optically and whether it is the right choice or how adjustments can be made to optimise performance. Techniques to assess visual performance and adverse effects must be carefully conducted to gain a reliable end-point, considering the target size, contrast and illumination. Objective techniques are generally more reliable, can help to explain unexpected subjective results and imaging can be a powerful communication tool with patients. A clear diagnosis, excluding factors such as binocular vision issues or digital eye strain that can also cause similar symptoms, is critical for the patient to understand and adapt to presbyopia. Some corrective options are more permanent, such as implanted inlays / intraocular lenses or laser refractive surgery, so the optics can be trialled with contact lenses in advance (including differences between the eyes) to better communicate with the patient how the optics will work for them so they can make an informed choice.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic came with many new challenges that forced personal and professional lifestyle modifications. Medical facilities were in scarcity against this new unknown enemy and were challenged with the overloaded patient flow, scarcity of healthcare staff, and evolving treatment modalities with a better understanding of the virus each day. Ophthalmology as a \"branch of medicine\" suffered challenges initially because of a lack of guidelines for patient management, close working distance during routine examinations, and halt of major surgeries, including cataracts. Pediatric ophthalmology had major implications, as reduced outpatient visits would mean deeper amblyopia, and changed lifestyles, including online classes and home refinement, predisposing children to myopia, digital eye strain, and worsening of strabismus. COVID-19 also unveiled underlying accommodation and convergence anomalies that predisposed pediatric and adolescent patients to an increased prevalence of headache and acute onset esotropia. Teleophthalmology and other innovative solutions, including the use of prism glasses, safe slit-lamp shields, alternative ways of school screening with the use of photoscreeners, performing retinoscopy only when needed, and using autorefractors were among the few guidelines or modifications adopted which helped in the efficient and safe management of pediatric patients. Many pediatric ophthalmologists also suffered in terms of financial constraints due to loss of salary or even closure of private practices. School screening and retinopathy of prematurity screening suffered a great setback and costed a lot of vision years, data of which remains under-reported. Important implications and learnings from the pandemic to mitigate future similar situations include using teleophthalmology and virtual platforms for the triage of patients, managing non-emergency conditions without physical consultations, and utilizing home-based vision assessment techniques customized for different age groups. Though this pandemic had a lot of negative implications, the innovations, modifications, and other important learnings helped pediatric ophthalmologists in navigating safely.",

      "title": "When Does Blur Matter? A Narrative Review and Commentary.",
      "abstract": "Blur is the subjective awareness that the edges of a high contrast image are indistinct. The concept of blur is fundamental to the understanding of vision, accommodation, refractive error, concomitant strabismus, and asthenopia. It is easy for clinicians to believe that blur always needs to be avoided or resolved, or that everyone responds to blur similarly. This narrative review outlines the literature on blur and the accommodation to resolve it, and relates it to current clinical practice. Laboratory studies have traditionally been highly controlled, using expert observers, but more recent research using naïve participants suggests that variability and tolerance of blur are common and more widespread than often thought, especially in children and clinical groups. Objective and subjective responses can differ widely, and it cannot be assumed that because we expect accommodation to have occurred, that it always has. A deeper understanding of the role of blur and objective accommodation in vision, refractive error and strabismus may help us understand the variability that exists in clinical practice. We may use blur to help investigation and treatment but also be relaxed about what is normal. Many patients are led to believe that they should always achieve constant clear vision, when this is unrealistic. Although pathological blur must be identified and treated, normal everyday blur may become medicalized into \"a problem\" by well-meaning professionals.",

We reviewed the current literature on the prevalence and mechanisms of DED in astronauts and its potential implications for long-duration spaceflight, including the influence of environmental factors, such as microgravity and fluid shift on tear film physiology in space. DED has negative effects on astronaut performance, which is why there is a need for further research into the pathophysiology and countermeasures.

      "abstract": "Romero-Parra, N, Cupeiro, R, Alfaro-Magallanes, VM, Rael, B, Rubio-Arias, JA, Peinado, AB, and Benito, PJ, IronFEMME Study Group. Exercise-induced muscle damage during the menstrual cycle: A systematic review and meta-analysis. J Strength Cond Res 35(2): 549-561, 2021-A strenuous bout of exercise could trigger damage of muscle tissue, and it is not clear how sex hormone fluctuations occurring during the menstrual cycle (MC) affect this response. The aims of this study were to systematically search and assess studies that have evaluated exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) in eumenorrheic women over the MC and to perform a meta-analysis to quantify which MC phases display the muscle damage response. The guidelines of the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis were followed. A total of 19 articles were analyzed in the quantitative synthesis. Included studies examined EIMD in at least one phase of the following MC phases: early follicular phase (EFP), late follicular phase (LFP), or midluteal phase (MLP). The meta-analysis demonstrated differences between MC phases for delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and strength loss (p < 0.05), whereas no differences were observed between MC phases for creatine kinase. The maximum mean differences between pre-excercise and post-exercise for DOMS were EFP: 6.57 (4.42, 8.71), LFP: 5.37 (2.10, 8.63), and MLP: 3.08 (2.22, 3.95), whereas for strength loss were EFP: -3.46 (-4.95, -1.98), LFP: -1.63 (-2.36, -0.89), and MLP: -0.72 (-1.07, -0.36) (p < 0.001). In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that hormone fluctuations throughout the MC affect EIMD in terms of DOMS and strength loss. Lower training loads or longer recovery periods could be considered in the EFP, when sex hormone concentrations are lower and women may be more vulnerable to muscle damage, whereas strength conditioning loads could be enhanced in the MLP.",

      "title": "Recommendations for Hamstring Function Recovery After ACL Reconstruction.",
      "abstract": "It is important to optimise the functional recovery process to enhance patient outcomes after major injury such as anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). This requires in part more high-quality original research, but also an approach to translate existing research into practice to overcome the research to implementation barriers. This includes research on ACLR athletes, but also research on other pathologies, which with some modification can be valuable to the ACLR patient. One important consideration after ACLR is the recovery of hamstring muscle function, particularly when using ipsilateral hamstring autograft. Deficits in knee flexor function after ACLR are associated with increased risk of knee osteoarthritis, altered gait and sport-type movement quality, and elevated risk of re-injury upon return to sport. After ACLR and the early post-operative period, there are often considerable deficits in hamstring function which need to be overcome as part of the functional recovery process. To achieve this requires consideration of many factors including the types of strength to recover (e.g., maximal and explosive, multiplanar not just uniplanar), specific programming principles (e.g., periodised resistance programme) and exercise selection. There is a need to know how to train the hamstrings, but also apply this to the ACLR athlete. In this paper, the authors discuss the deficits in hamstring function after ACLR, the considerations on how to restore these deficits and align this information to the ACLR functional recovery process, providing recommendation on how to recover hamstring function after ACLR.",

      "title": "Return to Play After a Hamstring Strain Injury: It is Time to Consider Natural Healing.",
      "abstract": "Return to play (RTP) criteria after hamstring strain injuries (HSIs) help clinicians in deciding whether an athlete is ready to safely resume previous sport activities. Today, functional and sport-specific training tests are the gold standard in the decision-making process. These criteria lead to an average RTP time between 11 and 25 days after a grade 1 or 2 HSI. However, the high re-injury rates indicate a possible inadequacy of the current RTP criteria. A possible explanation for this could be the neglect of biological healing time. The present review shows that studies indicating time as a possible factor within the RTP-decision are very scarce. However, studies on biological muscle healing showed immature scar tissue and incomplete muscle healing at the average moment of RTP. Twenty-five percent of the re-injuries occur in the first week after RTP and at the exact same location as the index injury. This review supports the statement that functional recovery precedes the biological healing of the muscle. Based on basic science studies on biological muscle healing, we recommend a minimum period of 4 weeks before RTP after a grade 1 or 2 HSI. In conclusion, we advise a comprehensive RTP functional test battery with respect for the natural healing process. Before deciding RTP readiness, clinicians should reflect whether or not it is biologically possible for the injured tissue to have regained enough strength to withstand the sport-specific forces. In an attempt to reduce the detrimental injury-reinjury cycle, it is time to start considering (biological healing) time.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle's metabolic and mechanical functions make it critical for maintaining human health, physical function, and quality of life in adults. The impact of skeletal muscle mass and the metabolic quality of muscle tissue becomes even more critical with advancing age and in patients with chronic diseases. To this end, cachexia is the involuntary loss of body weight, including muscle and fat loss, accompanying an underlying disease or condition. Cancer-induced cachexia occurs across many types of cancer and contributes to increased patient mortality, morbidity, and treatment toxicities, negatively impacting survival. Furthermore, there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments and limited evidence-based therapeutic options to prevent muscle loss or promote muscle recovery in cancer patients. While the systemic effects of cancer and subsequent treatment continue to be examined as drivers of overall wasting, the impact of skeletal muscle mass and metabolic quality in the cancer patient remains a critical area of investigation. A vital knowledge gap exists in understanding how maintaining muscle function and metabolic properties improves cancer patients' survival. The chapter explores the current understanding of how cancer and subsequent treatment impact skeletal muscle mass, function, and metabolic quality. To this end, the current understanding of systemic mediators and metabolic crosstalk between tissues that promote cancer-induced wasting is explored. Additional factors related to sex, physical activity level, chemotherapy-specific effects, and cancer heterogeneity are discussed concerning their impact on cancer-induced muscle wasting.",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have covered exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) topics, ranging from nutritional strategies to recovery methods, but few attempts have adequately explored and analyzed large volumes of scientific output. The purpose of this study was to assess the scientific output and research activity regarding EIMD and protein intake by conducting a bibliometric and visual analysis. Relevant publications from 1975-2022 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Quantitative and qualitative variables were collected, including the number of publications and citations, H-indexes, journals of citation reports, co-authorship, co-citation, and the co-occurrence of keywords. There were 351 total publications, with the number of annual publications steadily increasing. The United States has the highest total number of publications (26.21% of total publications, centrality 0.44). Institutional cooperation is mostly geographically limited, with few transnational cooperation links. EIMD and protein intake research is concentrated in high-quality journals in the disciplines of Sport Science, Physiology, Nutrition, and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology. The top ten journals in the number of publications are mostly high-quality printed journals, and the top ten journals in centrality have an average impact factor of 13.845. The findings of the co-citation clusters and major keyword co-occurrence reveal that the most discussed research topics are \"exercise mode\", \"nutritional strategies\", \"beneficial outcomes\", and \"proposed mechanisms\". Finally, we identified the following research frontiers and research directions: developing a comprehensive understanding of new exercise or training models, nutritional strategies, and recovery techniques to alleviate EIMD symptoms and accelerate recovery; applying the concept of hormesis in EIMD to induce muscle hypertrophy; and investigating the underlying mechanisms of muscle fiber and membrane damage.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is integral to life and functions to produce movement and locomotion, postural control, respiratory activity, and heat production. Yet, injuries to skeletal muscles occur across the lifespan, and depending on the injury mechanism, nuances in physiology and severity, how and if recovery of muscle function is possible is varied. This chapter presents the current physiologic understanding of various traumatic skeletal muscle injuries with attention to landmark work that has built the foundation for our current understanding. Injuries ranging from those that leave the extracellular matrix (ECM) intact or completely lost will be discussed as well as the common eccentric contraction-induced and ischemia-reperfusion injuries.",

      "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) impacts skeletal muscles and causes damage to associated tissues such as blood vessels and other structural tissues. Despite progress in the VML field, current preclinical approaches are often ineffective at restoring muscle volume. Additional research is paramount to develop strategies that improve muscle mass and function, while restoring supporting tissues. We highlight mechanisms that govern normal muscle function that are also key players for VML, including intracellular calcium signaling/homeostasis, mitochondria signaling (calcium, reactiove oxidative species (ROS)/oxidative stress), and angiogenesis. We propose an integration of these processes within the context of emerging biomaterials that provide structural support for muscle regeneration. We posit that new biomarkers (i.e. myokines and lipid signaling mediators) may serve as sentinels of early muscle injury and regeneration. We conclude that as new ideas, approaches, and models come together, new treatments will emerge to allow the full rebuilding of skeletal muscles and functional recovery of skeletal muscles after VML.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscles play important roles in critical body functions and their injury or disease can lead to limitation of mobility and loss of independence. Current treatments result in variable functional recovery, while reconstructive surgery, as the gold-standard approach, is limited due to donor shortage, donor-site morbidity, and limited functional recovery. Skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) has generated enthusiasm as an alternative solution for treatment of injured tissue and serves as a functional disease model. Recently, bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for recapitulating the complex and highly organized architecture of skeletal muscles at clinically relevant sizes. Here, skeletal muscle physiology, muscle regeneration following injury, and current treatments following muscle loss are discussed, and then bioprinting strategies implemented for SMTE are critically reviewed. Subsequently, recent advancements that have led to improvement of bioprinting strategies to construct large muscle structures, boost myogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and enhance tissue integration are discussed. Bioinks for muscle bioprinting, as an essential part of any bioprinting strategy, are discussed, and their benefits, limitations, and areas to be improved are highlighted. Finally, the directions the field should expand to make bioprinting strategies more translational and overcome the clinical unmet needs are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia refers to the progressive loss and atrophy of skeletal muscle function, often associated with aging or secondary to conditions involving systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent evidence indicates that skeletal muscle function is not only influenced by physical, environmental, and genetic factors but is also significantly impacted by nutritional deficiencies. Natural compounds with antioxidant properties, such as resveratrol and vitamin D, have shown promise in preventing mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle cells. These antioxidants can slow down muscle atrophy by regulating mitochondrial functions and neuromuscular junctions. This review provides an overview of the molecular mechanisms leading to skeletal muscle atrophy and summarizes recent advances in using resveratrol and vitamin D supplementation for its prevention and treatment. Understanding these molecular mechanisms and implementing combined interventions can optimize treatment outcomes, ensure muscle function recovery, and improve the quality of life for patients.",

      "abstract": "With age and disease, skeletal muscle is progressively lost and replaced by fibrotic scar and intramuscular adipose tissue (IMAT). While strongly correlated, it remains unclear whether IMAT has a functional impact on muscle. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of IMAT on muscle regeneration by creating a mouse model where the cellular origin of IMAT, fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), is prevented from differentiating into adipocytes (mFATBLOCK model). We found that blocking IMAT after an adipogenic injury allowed muscle to regenerate more efficiently, resulting in enhanced functional recovery. Our data explain why acute muscle injuries featuring IMAT infiltration, such as rotator cuff tears and acute denervation injuries, exhibit poor regeneration and lead to a loss of muscle function. It also demonstrates the therapeutic importance of preventing IMAT formation in acute injuries in order to maximize regeneration and minimize loss in muscle mass and function.",

      "abstract": "The study aimed to show the potential clinical application of supplements used among sportsmen for patients suffering from Intensive Care Unit-acquired Weakness (ICUAW) treatment. ICUAW is a common complication affecting approximately 40% of critically ill patients, often leading to long-term functional disability. ICUAW comprises critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, or a combination of both, such as critical illness polyneuromyopathy. Muscle degeneration begins shortly after the initiation of mechanical ventilation and persists post-ICU discharge until proteolysis and autophagy processes normalize. Several factors, including prolonged bedrest and muscle electrical silencing, contribute to muscle weakness, resulting from an imbalance between protein degradation and synthesis. ICUAW is associated with tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, reduced glucose uptake, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased free-radical production. Several well-studied dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals commonly used by athletes are proven to prevent the aforementioned mechanisms or aid in muscle building, regeneration, and maintenance. While there is no standardized treatment to prevent the occurrence of ICUAW, nutritional interventions have demonstrated the potential for its mitigation. The use of ergogenic substances, popular among muscle-building sociates, may offer potential benefits in preventing muscle loss and aiding recovery based on their work mechanisms.",

      "title": "Mitigating skeletal muscle wasting in unloading and augmenting subsequent recovery.",
      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle wasting is the hallmark pathophysiological adaptation to unloading or disuse that demonstrates the dependency on frequent mechanical stimulation (e.g. muscle activation and subsequent loading) for homeostasis of normally load-bearing muscles. In the absence of mitigation strategies, no mammalian organism is resistant to muscle atrophy driven by unloading. Given the profound impact of unloading-induced muscle wasting on physical capacity, metabolic health and immune function; mitigation strategies during unloading and/or augmentation approaches during recovery have broad healthcare implications in settings of bed-bound hospitalization, cast immobilization and spaceflight. This topical review aims to: (1) provide a succinct, state-of-the-field summary of seminal and recent findings regarding the mechanisms of unloading-induced skeletal muscle wasting; (2) discuss unsuccessful vs. promising mitigation and recovery augmentation strategies; and (3) identify knowledge gaps ripe for future research. We focus on the rapid muscle atrophy driven by relatively short-term mechanical unloading/disuse, which is in many ways mechanistically distinct from both hypermetabolic muscle wasting and denervation-induced muscle atrophy. By restricting this discussion to mechanical unloading during which all components of the nervous system remain intact (e.g. without denervation models), mechanical loading requiring motor and sensory neural circuits in muscle remain viable targets for both mitigation and recovery augmentation. We emphasize findings in humans with comparative discussions of studies in rodents which enable elaboration of key mechanisms. We also discuss what is currently known about the effects of age and sex as biological factors, and both are highlighted as knowledge gaps and novel future directions due to limited research.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal muscles may be both morphologically and functionally affected by pregnancy. Dysfunction of the muscles can lead to persistent postpartum low back pain. The recovery process of the abdominal muscles following childbirth is not well understood. This study aimed to demonstrate the changes in the thickness and contractile function of abdominal muscles during the first six months postpartum. Nine perinatal and 15 nulliparous females participated. The thicknesses and contraction/relaxation thickness ratios of the rectus abdominis (RA), external abdominal oblique (EO), internal abdominal oblique (IO), and transverse abdominis (TrA) were measured using ultrasound images from 36-39 weeks' gestation until six months postpartum. The RA, IO, and TrA muscles were thinner in perinatal females than controls at 36-39 weeks of gestation (4.8 vs. 9.47 mm (RA), 5.45 vs. 7.73 mm (IO), 2.56 vs. 3.38 mm (TrA), respectively). The thinner IO muscle persisted for six months after delivery. The decreased TrA thickness ratio persisted until four months post-delivery. Abdominal muscle thickness and contractile function decreased in the postpartum period. Therefore, abdominal muscle exercises might help prevent postpartum symptoms; however, because deterioration of muscle function is significant in the first four months, careful attention should be paid to exercise intensity. The study limitation was a relatively small sample size, thus future studies should involve more participants.",

In some cases (e.g. Myotonia Congenita) the phenotype is much more severe, whilst in others (e.g. Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis) rodent physiology is protective. This suggests a species' difference in muscle excitability properties. In humans these can be measured indirectly by the post-impulse changes in conduction velocity, using Muscle Velocity Recovery Cycles (MVRCs). We performed MVRCs in mice and compared their muscle excitability properties with humans. Mouse Tibialis Anterior MVRCs (n = 70) have only one phase of supernormality (increased conduction velocity), which is smaller in magnitude (p = 9 × 10",

Nevertheless, the only well-documented link between skeletal muscle activities and exertional heat stroke pathophysiology is the extensive muscle damage (e. g., rhabdomyolysis) and subsequent leakage of intramuscular content into the circulation of exertional heat stroke victims. Here, we will present and discuss rarely explored roles of skeletal muscles in the context of exertional heat stroke pathophysiology and recovery. This includes an overview of heat production that contributes to severe hyperthermia and the synthesis and secretion of bioactive molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines and acute phase proteins. These molecules can alter the overall inflammatory status from pro- to anti-inflammatory, affecting other organ systems and influencing recovery. The activation of innate immunity can determine whether a victim is ready to return to physical activity or experiences a prolonged convalescence. We also provide a brief discussion on whether heat acclimation can shift skeletal muscle secretory phenotype to prevent or aid recovery from exertional heat stroke. We conclude that skeletal muscles should be considered as a key organ system in exertional heat stroke pathophysiology.",

      "title": "A century of exercise physiology: key concepts in muscle cell volume regulation.",
      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle cells can both gain and lose volume during periods of exercise and rest. Muscle cells do not behave as perfect osmometers because the cell volume changes are less than predicted from the change in extracellular osmolality. Therefore, there are mechanisms involved in regulating cell volume, and they are different for regulatory volume decreases and regulatory volume increases. Also, after an initial rapid change in cell volume, there is a gradual and partial recovery of cell volume that is effected by ion and water transport mechanisms. The mechanisms have been studied in non-contracting muscle cells, but remain to be fully elucidated in contracting muscle. Changes in muscle cell volume are known to affect the strength of contractile activity as well as anabolic/catabolic signaling, perhaps indicating that cell volume should be a regulated variable in skeletal muscle cells. Muscles contracting at moderate to high intensity gain intracellular volume because of increased intracellular osmolality. Concurrent increases in interstitial (extracellular) muscle volume occur from an increase in osmotically active molecules and increased vascular filtration pressure. At the same time, non-contracting muscles lose cell volume because of increased extracellular (blood) osmolality. This review provides the physiological foundations and highlights key concepts that underpin our current understanding of volume regulatory processes in skeletal muscle, beginning with consideration of osmosis more than 200 years ago and continuing through to the process of regulatory volume decrease and regulatory volume increase.",

In Oriental Medicine, it is categorized as a tonic remedy for alleviating symptoms of fatigue and enhancing the strength of bones and muscles. In this study, we aimed to validate the effectiveness of the aquo-ethanolic extract of Lilli Bulbus (LBE) in a dexamethasone (DEX)-induced muscle atrophy model, both in vitro and in vivo, and elucidate its mechanism of action through muscle transcriptome analysis. The effects of LBE on the viability and myotube density of C2C12 myoblasts and differentiated C2C12 myotubes with and without DEX treatment were investigated. LBE pretreatment protected C2C12 myoblast cells and increased the muscle density of C2C12 myotubes in response to DEX. LBE showed potent free radical scavenging activities in cell-free biochemical assays as well as antioxidant activity in C2C12 myoblasts. LBE also exhibited protective effects in an experimental animal model of DEX-induced muscle atrophy, showing muscular function and motor coordination recovery. Transcriptomic analysis of three different muscle tissues from mice with DEX-induced muscle atrophy showed that the regulation of the extracellular matrix was perturbed by glucocorticoid treatment, and this perturbation was reversed by LBE treatment. Collectively, LBE alleviated skeletal muscle loss and maintained muscle function from the chronic toxicity of DEX by protecting muscle cells from various stressful conditions, as well as DEX itself, inhibiting muscle protein degradation, and preserving the muscle tissue microenvironment.",

It has been shown that bioactive peptides can be resorbed in their intact form and have repeatedly been shown to have a positive effect on health-related parameters such as hypertension, dyslipoproteinemia, inflammation and oxidative stress. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that biologically active peptides could also play an important role in sports nutrition. Current studies have shown that bioactive peptides could have a positive impact on changes in body composition and muscular performance, reduce muscle damage following exercise and induce beneficial adaptions within the connective tissue. In the following overview, potential mechanisms as well as possible limitations regarding the sports-related effect of bioactive peptides and their potential mechanisms are presented and discussed. In addition, practical applications will be discussed on how bioactive peptides can be integrated into a nutritional approach in sports to enhance athletic performance as well as prevent injuries and improve the rehabilitation process.",

      "title": "Recycle, repair, recover: the role of autophagy in modulating skeletal muscle repair and post-exercise recovery.",
      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue that can adapt relatively rapidly to a range of stimuli. In response to novel mechanical loading, e.g. unaccustomed resistance exercise, myofibers are disrupted and undergo a period of ultrastructural remodeling to regain full physiological function, normally within 7 days. The mechanisms that underpin this remodeling are believed to be a combination of cellular processes including ubiquitin-proteasome/calpain-mediated degradation, immune cell infiltration, and satellite cell proliferation/differentiation. A relatively understudied system that has the potential to be a significant contributing mechanism to repair and recovery is the autophagolysosomal system, an intracellular process that degrades damaged and redundant cellular components to provide constituent metabolites for the resynthesis of new organelles and cellular structures. This review summarizes our current understanding of the autophagolysosomal system in the context of skeletal muscle repair and recovery. In addition, we also provide hypothetical models of how this system may interact with other processes involved in skeletal muscle remodeling and provide avenues for future research to improve our understanding of autophagy in human skeletal muscle.",

      "title": "Hamstring muscle injuries in athletics.",
      "abstract": "Hamstring muscle injuries (HMI) are a common and recurrent issue in the sport of athletics, particularly in sprinting and jumping disciplines. This review summarizes the latest literature on hamstring muscle injuries in athletics from a clinical perspective. The considerable heterogeneity in injury definitions and reporting methodologies among studies still needs to be addressed for greater clarity. Expert teams have recently developed evidence-based muscle injury classification systems whose application could guide clinical decision-making; however, no system has been adopted universally in clinical practice, yet.The most common risk factor for HMI is a previously sustained injury, particularly early after return-to-sport. Other modifiable (e.g. weakness of thigh muscles, high-speed running exposure) and non-modifiable (e.g. older age) risk factors have limited evidence linking them to injury. Reducing injury may be achieved through exercise-based programs, but their specific components and their practical applicability remain unclear.Post-injury management follows similar recommendations to other soft tissue injuries, with a graded progression through stages of rehabilitation to full return to training and then competition, based on symptoms and clinical signs to guide the individual speed of the recovery journey. Evidence favoring surgical repair is conflicting and limited to specific injury sub-types (e.g. proximal avulsions). Further research is needed on specific rehabilitation components and progression criteria, where more individualized approaches could address the high rates of recurrent HMI. Prognostically, a combination of physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) seems superior to imaging alone when predicting 'recovery duration,' particularly at the individual level.",

      "title": "The Biological Basis of Sex Differences in Athletic Performance: Consensus Statement for the American College of Sports Medicine.",
      "abstract": "Biological sex is a primary determinant of athletic performance because of fundamental sex differences in anatomy and physiology dictated by sex chromosomes and sex hormones. Adult men are typically stronger, more powerful, and faster than women of similar age and training status. Thus, for athletic events and sports relying on endurance, muscle strength, speed, and power, males typically outperform females by 10%-30% depending on the requirements of the event. These sex differences in performance emerge with the onset of puberty and coincide with the increase in endogenous sex steroid hormones, in particular testosterone in males, which increases 30-fold by adulthood, but remains low in females. The primary goal of this consensus statement is to provide the latest scientific knowledge and mechanisms for the sex differences in athletic performance. This review highlights the differences in anatomy and physiology between males and females that are primary determinants of the sex differences in athletic performance and in response to exercise training, and the role of sex steroid hormones (particularly testosterone and estradiol). We also identify historical and nonphysiological factors that influence the sex differences in performance. Finally, we identify gaps in the knowledge of sex differences in athletic performance and the underlying mechanisms, providing substantial opportunities for high-impact studies. A major step toward closing the knowledge gap is to include more and equitable numbers of women to that of men in mechanistic studies that determine any of the sex differences in response to an acute bout of exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "Many athletes utilize high-dose vitamin C supplementation to optimize athletic performance. A review of research over the past 10 years on the use of vitamin C and athletic performance show mixed results. Fourteen randomized control trials were reviewed. In most studies, vitamin C was used with at least one additional supplement, usually vitamin E. Three studies showed positive outcomes associated with decreased markers of muscle damage after intense exercise with some form of vitamin C supplementation. The remaining 11 articles showed either neutral or negative effects of high dose vitamin C supplementation on muscle damage, physical performance, perceived muscle soreness, and/or adaptations to training. Based on a lack of consistent data and potential for blunted physiologic adaptations to training, long-term high-dosage supplementation with vitamin C is not recommended. Athletes should obtain antioxidants through a nutrient-rich diet instead of through supplement use.",

      "abstract": "Sport psychology as an academic pursuit is nearly two centuries old. An enduring goal since inception has been to understand how psychological techniques can improve athletic performance. Although much evidence exists in the form of meta-analytic reviews related to sport psychology and performance, a systematic review of these meta-analyses is absent from the literature. We aimed to synthesize the extant literature to gain insights into the overall impact of sport psychology on athletic performance. Guided by the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews, we reviewed relevant articles identified via the EBSCOhost interface. Thirty meta-analyses published between 1983 and 2021 met the inclusion criteria, covering 16 distinct sport psychology constructs. Overall, sport psychology interventions/variables hypothesized to enhance performance (e.g., cohesion, confidence, mindfulness) were shown to have a moderate beneficial effect (d = 0.51), whereas variables hypothesized to be detrimental to performance (e.g., cognitive anxiety, depression, ego climate) had a small negative effect (d = -0.21). The quality rating of meta-analyses did not significantly moderate the magnitude of observed effects, nor did the research design (i.e., intervention vs. correlation) of the primary studies included in the meta-analyses. Our review strengthens the evidence base for sport psychology techniques and may be of great practical value to practitioners. We provide recommendations for future research in the area.",

Some believe that plant-based diets will improve performance owing to higher intakes of carbohydrates and antioxidants. Some believe it that will harm performance due to lower intakes of complete protein and creatine. This systemic review was conducted using Covidence software. A literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), and Web of Science was completed on 22 March 2022. Following the development of clear objectives and a research question that identified the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes, initial search criteria and keywords were identified. Extracted results totaled 2249, including 797 duplicates. The initial screening resulted in 1437 articles being excluded. The remaining 15 articles proceeded to full-text screening. A final 8 articles were included in the review, with 7 excluded.

      "abstract": "Sex as a biological variable is an underappreciated aspect of biomedical research, with its importance emerging in more recent years. This review assesses the current understanding of sex differences in human physical performance. Males outperform females in many physical capacities because they are faster, stronger and more powerful, particularly after male puberty. This review highlights key sex differences in physiological and anatomical systems (generally conferred via sex steroids and puberty) that contribute to these sex differences in human physical performance. Specifically, we address the effects of the primary sex steroids that affect human physical development, discuss insight gained from an observational study of 'real-world data' and elite athletes, and highlight the key physiological mechanisms that contribute to sex differences in several aspects of physical performance. Physiological mechanisms discussed include those for the varying magnitude of the sex differences in performance involving: (1) absolute muscular strength and power; (2) fatigability of limb muscles as a measure of relative performance; and (3) maximal aerobic power and endurance. The profound sex-based differences in human performance involving strength, power, speed and endurance, and that are largely attributable to the direct and indirect effects of sex-steroid hormones, sex chromosomes and epigenetics, provide a scientific rationale and framework for policy decisions on sex-based categories in sports during puberty and adulthood. Finally, we highlight the sex bias and problem in human performance research of insufficient studies and information on females across many areas of biology and physiology, creating knowledge gaps and opportunities for high-impact studies.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of the current study was twofold (a) to examine elite female athletes' experiences of their menstrual cycle, with a focus upon the impact on training and competition performance and (b) the openness of conversation pertaining to the menstrual cycle with coaching and support staff. Following receipt of institutional ethical approval, individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 elite female athletes (25.5 ± 4.7 years) from multiple sports. Results revealed athletes' experiencing a natural menstrual cycle reported physical symptoms alongside mood disturbances and reduced motivation to train. The decision to actively control the menstrual cycle was often triggered by a desire to reduce the effect on competition, to lessen anxieties about making required weight or reduce distraction to manage during competition. Athletes indicated an openness to talk about the menstrual cycle to other females, however, there was variation in the comfort athletes experienced regarding talking to male coaches. Overall, the findings highlight the need to educate elite athletes and coaches on the menstrual cycle, considering it in the same light as other physiological functions in sport to improve health, well-being, and performance. Furthermore, providing education on how to construct positive conversations, equipping individuals with the correct terminology, and confidence to talk about the menstrual cycle will reduce some reservations identified through improved knowledge and understanding.",

      "abstract": "Mid-day napping has been recommended as a countermeasure against sleep debt and an effective method for recovery, regardless of nocturnal sleep duration. Herein, we summarize the available evidence regarding the influence of napping on exercise and cognitive performance as well as the effects of napping on athletes' perceptual responses prior to or during exercise. The existing studies investigating the influence of napping on athletic performance have revealed equivocal results. Prevailing findings indicate that following a normal sleep night or after a night of sleep loss, a mid-day nap may enhance or restore several exercise and cognitive performance aspects, while concomitantly provide benefits on athletes' perceptual responses. Most, but not all, findings suggest that compared to short-term naps (20-30 min), long-term ones (>35-90 min) appear to provide superior benefits to the athletes. The underlying mechanisms behind athletic performance enhancement following a night of normal sleep or the restoration after a night of sleep loss are not clear yet. However, the absence of benefits or even the deterioration of performance following napping in some studies is likely the result of sleep inertia. The present review sheds light on the predisposing factors that influence the post-nap outcome, such as nocturnal sleep time, mid-day nap duration and the time elapsed between the end of napping and the subsequent testing, discusses practical solutions and stimulates further research on this area.",

Athletes' physical performances could be impacted by the metabolic activity of the assortment of microbes found in their gut. Intestinal microbiota impacts multiple facets of an athlete's physiology, including immune response, gut membrane integrity, macro- and micronutrient absorption, muscle endurance, and the gut-brain axis. Several physiological variables govern the gut microbiota; hence, an intricately tailored and complex framework must be implemented to comprehend the performance-microbiota interaction. Emerging evidence underscores the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and physical fitness, revealing that athletes who engage in regular physical activity exhibit a richer diversity of gut microbes, particularly within the Firmicutes phylum, e.g., ",

      "abstract": "CrossFit (CF) is characterized as a constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement training program, performed with little or no rest between bouts, combining strength and endurance exercises, such as running, cycling, rowing, Olympic weightlifting, power weightlifting, and gymnastic-type exercises. Several nutritional strategies are used to improve sports performance of CF practitioners; however, most of them are empirical and lack scientific evidence. Thus, the aim of this review was to determine the effects of diet intervention, dietary supplements, and performance-enhancing substances on exercise-performance parameters of CF practitioners. MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, LILACS, SciELO, and Scopus databases were searched using specific Medical Subject Headings and keywords for clinical studies that enrolled CF athletes in an intervention using diet, dietary supplements, or performance-enhancing substances. Athletic performance was considered as the primary outcome. No other filters were applied. Including grey literature search, 219 studies were identified; however only 14 studies met the eligibility criteria. Two studies evaluated the effects of caffeine supplementation on exercise performance; five studies evaluated high- or low-carbohydrate effects on performance and other parameters. One study verified the effects of multi-ingredient supplementation on CF-specific performance and body composition. One study compared the intake of protein supplements on performance and body composition. Two studies assessed the effect of green tea and (-)-epicatechin on performance and other parameters. One study evaluated the effects of nitrate supplementation on exercise performance. One study investigated the effect of betaine supplementation on body composition and muscle performance. Finally, one study examined the effects of sodium bicarbonate (SB) ingestion on exercise performance and aerobic capacity. Only SB supplementation improved CF performance. These outcomes may have been obtained due to methodological limitations such as small sample size, lack of control over influencing variables, short period of exercise intervention. Despite the popularity and growing evidence about CF, little is known about the relationship between performance-enhancing substances or dietary interventions and CF performance. Given the lack of scientific evidence, new studies with potential ergogenic supplements, a better methodological model, and practical application are required.",

      "abstract": "Endurance athletes prioritize most of their training in low-intensity zone. This forms a paradox, as immediate logic would argue against it: Acutely low-intensity exercise does not challenge the homeostasis or cardiopulmonary system of high-level athletes sufficiently to produce performance gains comparable to those from moderate- or high-intensity exercise. In this perspective study, seven possible explanations for the purpose of excessive-volume low-intensity training in endurance athletes are proposed. The hypotheses are not all mutually exclusive. They range from a psychological need for easy days and the incremental benefits of low-intensity training without accumulating stress, to the possibility that such training may ultimately be replaceable.",

      "title": "Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Endurance Athletes: Interpretation and Relevance of Measurements for Improving Performance and Health.",
      "abstract": "Blood glucose regulation has been studied for well over a century as it is intimately related to metabolic health. Research in glucose transport and uptake has also been substantial within the field of exercise physiology as glucose delivery to the working muscles affects exercise capacity and athletic achievements. However, although exceptions exist, less focus has been on blood glucose as a parameter to optimize training and competition outcomes in athletes with normal glucose control. During the last years, measuring glucose has gained popularity within the sports community and successful endurance athletes have been seen with skin-mounted sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). The technique offers real-time recording of glucose concentrations in the interstitium, which is assumed to be equivalent to concentrations in the blood. Although continuous measurements of a parameter that is intimately connected to metabolism and health can seem appealing, there is no current consensus on how to interpret measurements within this context. Well-defined approaches to use glucose monitoring to improve endurance athletes' performance and health are lacking. In several studies, blood glucose regulation in endurance athletes has been shown to differ from that in healthy controls. Furthermore, endurance athletes regularly perform demanding training sessions and can be exposed to high or low energy and/or carbohydrate availability, which can affect blood glucose levels and regulation. In this current opinion, we aim to discuss blood glucose regulation in endurance athletes and highlight the existing research on glucose monitoring for performance and health in this population.",

      "abstract": "Circadian rhythms in the physiological and behavioral processes of humans play a crucial role in the quality of living and also in the magnitude of success and failure in various endeavors including competitive sports. The rhythmic activities of the body and performance in sportspersons do have a massive impact on their every cutthroat competition. It is essential to schedule sports activities and training of players according to their circadian typology and time of peak performance for improved performance and achievement. In this review, the focus is on circadian rhythms and diurnal variations in peak athletic performance in sportspersons. Accuracy and temporal variability in peak performance in an individual could be attributed to various factors, namely chronotype, time of the day, body temperature, jetlag, hormones, and prior light exposure. Circadian rhythm of mood, alertness, T-core, and ultimately athletic performance is not only affected by sleep but also by circadian variations in hormones, such as cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin. There are, however, a few reports that are not consistent with the conclusions drawn in this review. Nevertheless, circadian rhythm and performance among sportspersons and athletes are important areas of research. This review might be useful to the managers and policymakers associated with competitive sports and athletic events.",

This systematic reviewaimed to comprehensively and critically review the available studies in the literature that investigate the impact of core training on basketball players' physical and skill performance, and then offer valuable recommendations for both coaches and researchers. Thedata collection, selection, and analysis adhered to the PRISMA protocol. English databases, including Ebscohost, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar,were searched until September 2022. A total of eight articles were included, with four studies comparing the effects of core training versus traditional strength training or usual basketball training. All studies investigated the impact of core training on athletic performance. The findings revealed that core training can help players improve their overall athletic and skill performance, particularly in the areas of strength, sprinting,jumping, balance, agility, shooting, dribbling, passing, rebounding, and stepping. In addition, core training, particularly on unstable surfaces,as well as combining static and dynamic core training,improvebasketball players' athletic and skill performance. Despite the relativelylittle evidence demonstrating the effect of core training on endurance, flexibility, and defensive skills, this review demonstrates that it should be incorporated into basketball training sessions.",

      "abstract": "Flavonoids, known for their antioxidant properties, can prevent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and influence athletic performance through various physiological and metabolic mechanisms. However, there are conflicting results after summarizing and analyzing the relevant literature. Hence, it is warranted to evaluate the overall impact of flavonoids on athletic performance in healthy adults based on a comprehensive and systematic review and meta-analysis. After searching four databases for literature published since their respective establishments until February 2023 and conducting publication bias and quality assessments, a total of 22 studies were ultimately included. The names and doses of flavonoids, various outcome measurements, as well as types of training, were extracted from included studies. The athletic performance outcomes from the included studies were categorized into 'performance tests' and 'exercise tolerance,' depending on the type of training undertaken. Several statistical results, such as pooled effect size (ES), among others, were implemented by meta-analysis using the random effects model. The results of meta-analysis suggest that there is currently sufficient evidence (ES = -0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI): [-0.50, -0.07]; ",

From a total of 2304 relevant articles, 13 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Seven studies concern endurance athletes, one to rugby players, three refer to non-specified athletes, one to badminton players, and one involves baseball players. The evidence suggests that the integration of athletes' diets with some bacterial strains and also the consumption of multi-strain compounds may lead to an improvement in performance and can positively affect performance-related aspects such as fatigue, muscle pain, body composition, and cardiorespiratory fitness. However, the type of supplementation and sport is very variable among the studies examined. Therefore, to obtain more solid evidence, further controlled and comparable studies are needed to expand the research regarding the possible repercussions of probiotics use on athletes' performance.",

      "title": "Transwoman Elite Athletes: Their Extra Percentage Relative to Female Physiology.",
      "abstract": "There is increasing debate as to whether transwoman athletes should be included in the elite female competition. Most elite sports are divided into male and female divisions because of the greater athletic performance displayed by males. Without the sex division, females would have little chance of winning because males are faster, stronger, and have greater endurance capacity. Male physiology underpins their better athletic performance including increased muscle mass and strength, stronger bones, different skeletal structure, better adapted cardiorespiratory systems, and early developmental effects on brain networks that wires males to be inherently more competitive and aggressive. Testosterone secreted before birth, postnatally, and then after puberty is the major factor that drives these physiological sex differences, and as adults, testosterone levels are ten to fifteen times higher in males than females. The non-overlapping ranges of testosterone between the sexes has led sports regulators, such as the International Olympic Committee, to use 10 nmol/L testosterone as a sole physiological parameter to divide the male and female sporting divisions. Using testosterone levels as a basis for separating female and male elite athletes is arguably flawed. Male physiology cannot be reformatted by estrogen therapy in transwoman athletes because testosterone has driven permanent effects through early life exposure. This descriptive critical review discusses the inherent male physiological advantages that lead to superior athletic performance and then addresses how estrogen therapy fails to create a female-like physiology in the male. Ultimately, the former male physiology of transwoman athletes provides them with a physiological advantage over the cis-female athlete.",

      "abstract": "The current commentary adopts a skill acquisition science perspective on the distinction between skill and technique, two constructs often confused in football science and practice. It first positions technique as a coordination pattern. It then argues that experts rarely (if ever) coordinate their neuromuscular system in the same way through evidence of inter- and intra-individual movement variability from football science and other domains of sport science. It concludes by asserting that skill distinguishes itself from technique by its requirement for functional and beneficial coordination patterns, meaning that coaches, sporting practitioners and researchers should consider skill as any technique that an athlete successfully applies to a situation that requires it.",

      "abstract": "Wearable technologies are small electronic and mobile devices with wireless communication capabilities that can be worn on the body as a part of devices, accessories or clothes. Sensors incorporated within wearable devices enable the collection of a broad spectrum of data that can be processed and analysed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this narrative review, we performed a literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. We included any original studies that used sensors to collect data for a sporting event and subsequently used an AI-based system to process the data with diagnostic, treatment or monitoring intents. The included studies show the use of AI in various sports including basketball, baseball and motor racing to improve athletic performance. We classified the studies according to the stage of an event, including pre-event training to guide performance and predict the possibility of injuries; during events to optimise performance and inform strategies; and in diagnosing injuries after an event. Based on the included studies, AI techniques to process data from sensors can detect patterns in physiological variables as well as positional and kinematic data to inform how athletes can improve their performance. Although AI has promising applications in sports medicine, there are several challenges that can hinder their adoption. We have also identified avenues for future work that can provide solutions to overcome these challenges.",

      "abstract": "Taper is a common training strategy used to reduce fatigue and enhance athletic performance. However, currently, no review has summarised what psychological research has been conducted examining taper, what this research shows and what future research needs to be undertaken to extend the field. Consequently, a scoping review was conducted with three aims: (a) to determine the characteristics of psychological research examining taper, (b) to summarise psychological research collected during taper with adult athletes and coaches, and (c) to identify gaps in psychological research examining taper. Forty-eight articles were identified following an exhaustive search strategy and charted following scoping review guidelines. Results showed most research was quantitative, used a longitudinal design, was conducted in swimming, triathlon, cycling or across multiple sports, and used a university-, regional- or national-level male athlete sample. Eight themes were developed to summarise the research: Mood, Perception of Effort, Perceived Fatigue and Wellness, Recovery-Stress, Taper as a Stressor, Stress Tolerance, Psychological Preparation and Cognitive Functioning. Additionally, four research recommendations were identified: (a) conducting exploratory research that examines the impact taper has on athletes' and coaches' competition preparation and stress experience, (b) asking more advanced psychological questions and conducting multi-disciplinary research, (c) including a more diverse participant sample in studies and (d) examining the impact of psychological interventions during taper. Overall, this scoping review has highlighted the limited research examining the psychology of taper and the need for focused research that asks more complex questions across diverse populations.",

Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether athletic performance or some physical fitness measure is affected by prior sexual activity. Web of Science (all databases) and Google Scholar were used to identify studies from which adult healthy subjects were included. As all studies were crossover trials, an inverse variance statistical method with random effects was used to minimize the uncertainty of the pooled effect estimate. Bias was assessed via the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2) with a \"per protocol\" analysis. Nine crossover studies (133 subjects, 99% male) were used in this meta-analysis. All those studies did not examine athletic performance per se, but all studies assessed one or more physical fitness parameters. The RoB 2 suggested that overall, there were some concerns with bias.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate developmental patterns in athletic performance during youth and determine their association with changes in physical fitness. The testing included three athletic performance (i.e. ball speed in pitching, swing velocity in batting, 30-metre sprint time) and two physical fitness tests (i.e. medicine ball [MB] back throw and modified star excursion balance test [SEBT]). Data from 235 players (557 measurements) aged 6 to 14 were eligible for a longitudinal evaluation. The statistical analysis was based on the latent growth curve models of the athletic performance development process and the random-effect panel data multivariate regression analysis for ball speed, swing velocity, and 30-metre sprint time. The 30-metre sprint time showed a small curvature but an accelerated increase around 12‒13 years old. However, the ball speed, swing velocity, and modified SEBT demonstrated a slower or less accelerated change in the developmental pattern starting around 12‒13 years old. Multivariate longitudinal analysis revealed that developmental change in athletic performance was positively associated with age and MB back throw. Our findings highlight the developmental patterns of athletic performance associated with baseball exhibiting stagnation as well as acceleration, which may help develop effective age-appropriate strategies for improving performance in youth baseball players.",

      "abstract": "Forsyth, JR, Riddiford-Harland, DL, Whitting, JW, Sheppard, JM, and Steele, JR. Essential skills for superior wave-riding performance: A systematic review. J Strength Cond Res 34(10): 3003-3011, 2020-To successfully and safely perform surfing maneuvers, surfers and their coaches need to know how to perform each maneuver correctly. Although some components of the sport are well understood, evidence-based recommendations in the scientific literature on how to perform surfing skills are sparse. The aim of this article was to systematically review the body of literature pertaining to discrete wave-riding skills and characteristics that are associated with the ability of surfers to successfully perform them. Searches of PubMed, SCOPUS, SPORTDiscus with Full-text, and Web of Science were undertaken in January 2019, to identify the most appropriate literature, with secondary searches of reference lists used to create a greater pool of possible articles. The review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Ten studies deemed appropriate for review captured data from 299 surfers, who were predominantly competitive (78.3%) and male (58.2%). The average Down and Black Quality Index of the articles was 76.3 ± 8.4%, with these articles focusing on the \"pop-up\" and landing skills. Performance indicators, such as isometric push-up peak forces, force-plate derived and in-water time to pop-up, relative peak forces generated when landing and time-to-stabilization, were all shown to be related to the physical characteristics of surfers and could affect the ability of surfers to successfully ride a wave. Findings from the studies included in this review suggest that the pop-up and landing exhibit trainable qualities that coaches and athletes can use to improve surfing performance.",
