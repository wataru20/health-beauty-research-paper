      "abstract": "The maternal immune system protects developing offspring against pathogens before birth via transplacental transfer and after birth through secreted milk. This transferred maternal immunity influences each generation's susceptibility to infections and responsiveness to immunization. Thus, boosting immunity in the maternal-neonatal dyad is a potentially valuable public health strategy. Additionally, at critical times during fetal and postnatal development, environmental factors and immune stimuli influence immune development. These \"windows of opportunity\" offer a chance to identify both risk and protective factors that promote long-term health and limit disease. Here, we review pre- and postpartum maternal immune factors that protect against infectious agents in offspring and how they may shape the infant's immune landscape over time. Additionally, we discuss the influence of maternal immunity on the responsiveness to immunization in early life. Lastly, when maternal factors are insufficient to prevent neonatal infectious diseases, we discuss pre- and postnatal therapeutic strategies for the maternal-neonatal dyad.",

      "abstract": "Immune responses are tightly regulated yet highly variable between individuals. To investigate human population variation of trained immunity, we immunized healthy individuals with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This live-attenuated vaccine induces not only an adaptive immune response against tuberculosis but also triggers innate immune activation and memory that are indicative of trained immunity. We established personal immune profiles and chromatin accessibility maps over a 90-day time course of BCG vaccination in 323 individuals. Our analysis uncovered genetic and epigenetic predictors of baseline immunity and immune response. BCG vaccination enhanced the innate immune response specifically in individuals with a dormant immune state at baseline, rather than providing a general boost of innate immunity. This study advances our understanding of BCG's heterologous immune-stimulatory effects and trained immunity in humans. Furthermore, it highlights the value of epigenetic cell states for connecting immune function with genotype and the environment.",

      "abstract": "Since May 2022, mutant strains of mpox (formerly monkeypox) virus (MPXV) have been rapidly spreading among individuals who have not traveled to endemic areas in multiple locations, including Europe and the United States. Both intracellular and extracellular forms of mpox virus have multiple outer membrane proteins that can stimulate immune response. Here, we investigated the immunogenicity of MPXV structural proteins such as A29L, M1R, A35R, and B6R as a combination vaccine, and the protective effect against the 2022 mpox mutant strain was also evaluated in BALB/c mice. After mixed 15 μg QS-21 adjuvant, all four virus structural proteins were administered subcutaneously to mice. Antibody titers in mouse sera rose sharply after the initial boost, along with an increased capacity of immune cells to produce IFN-γ alongside an elevated level of cellular immunity mediated by Th1 cells. The vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies significantly inhibited the replication of MPXV in mice and reduced the pathological damage of organs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a multiple recombinant vaccine for MPXV variant strains.",

      "title": "Recall of B cell memory depends on relative locations of prime and boost immunization.",
      "abstract": "Immunization or microbial infection can establish long-term B cell memory not only systemically but also locally. Evidence has suggested that local B cell memory contributes to early local plasmacytic responses after secondary challenge. However, it is unclear whether locality of immunization plays any role in memory B cell participation in recall germinal centers (GCs), which is essential for updating their B cell antigen receptors (BCRs). Using single B cell culture and fate mapping, we have characterized BCR repertoires in recall GCs after boost immunizations at sites local or distal to the priming. Local boosts with homologous antigen recruit the progeny of primary GC B cells to recall GCs more efficiently than do distal boosts. Recall GCs elicited by local boosts contain significantly more B cells with elevated levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) mutation and higher avidity BCRs. This local preference is unaffected by blocking CD40:CD154 interaction to terminate active, GC responses. Local boosts with heterologous antigens elicit secondary GCs with B cell populations enriched for cross-reactivity to the prime and boost antigens; in contrast, cross-reactive GC B cells are rare after distal boosts. Our results suggest that local B cell memory is retained in the form of memory B cells, GC B cells, and GC phenotype B cells that are independent of organized GC structures and that these persistent \"primed B cells\" contribute to recall GC responses at local sites. Our findings indicate the importance of locality in humoral immunity and inform serial vaccination strategies for evolving viruses.",

      "abstract": "RNA vaccines are efficient preventive measures to combat the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. High levels of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are an important component of vaccine-induced immunity. Shortly after the initial two mRNA vaccine doses, the immunoglobulin G (IgG) response mainly consists of the proinflammatory subclasses IgG1 and IgG3. Here, we report that several months after the second vaccination, SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were increasingly composed of noninflammatory IgG4, which were further boosted by a third mRNA vaccination and/or SARS-CoV-2 variant breakthrough infections. IgG4 antibodies among all spike-specific IgG antibodies rose, on average, from 0.04% shortly after the second vaccination to 19.27% late after the third vaccination. This induction of IgG4 antibodies was not observed after homologous or heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with adenoviral vectors. Single-cell sequencing and flow cytometry revealed substantial frequencies of IgG4-switched B cells within the spike-binding memory B cell population [median of 14.4%; interquartile range (IQR) of 6.7 to 18.1%] compared with the overall memory B cell repertoire (median of 1.3%; IQR of 0.9 to 2.2%) after three immunizations. This class switch was associated with a reduced capacity of the spike-specific antibodies to mediate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and complement deposition. Because Fc-mediated effector functions are critical for antiviral immunity, these findings may have consequences for the choice and timing of vaccination regimens using mRNA vaccines, including future booster immunizations against SARS-CoV-2.",

Despite its potential threat to public health, no prophylactic vaccine is yet available. This study developed a heterologous prime-boost strategy comprising priming with recombinant replication-deficient human adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) expressing the surface glycoprotein, Gn, and boosting with Gn protein. This vaccination regimen induced balanced Th1/Th2 immune responses and resulted in potent humoral and T cell-mediated responses in mice. It elicited high neutralizing antibody titers in both mice and non-human primates. Transcriptome analysis revealed that rAd5 and Gn proteins induced adaptive and innate immune pathways, respectively. This study provides immunological and mechanistic insight into this heterologous regimen and paves the way for future strategies against emerging infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to longitudinally evaluate the undetermined impact of methotrexate (MTX) on the cumulative immunogenicity elicited by three doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We prospectively evaluated vaccine-induced immune responses following the first dose, 1 and 6 months after the second dose, and 1 month after the third dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 in 144 SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants (70 patients with RA, 29 disease controls without immunosuppressive conditions, and 45 healthy controls). Humoral immune responses were assessed by quantifying anti-spike IgG antibody titers and the capacity of circulating antibodies to neutralize the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. Vaccine-induced T-cell responses were measured using an interferon-gamma release assay. At 1 and 6 months after the second dose, anti-spike titers were highest in healthy controls, followed by disease controls and patients with RA. Multivariate analyses revealed that MTX treatment was significantly associated with a decrease in anti-spike titers, neutralizing activity, and SARS-CoV-2-specific interferon-gamma levels. Furthermore, MTX dose per body weight was negatively correlated with these two indices of humoral immune response. The third vaccine dose boosted anti-spike titers, especially in patients receiving MTX, while sera from these patients neutralized the Omicron variant far less robustly than those from healthy controls. In conclusion, MTX attenuated immunogenicity following two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in patients with RA, particularly resulting in dose-dependent suppression of the humoral immune response. Furthermore, MTX deteriorated the neutralizing activity against the Omicron variant, even after the third immunization.",

      "abstract": "In July 2022, the ongoing monkeypox (MPX) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern. Modified vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic (MVA-BN, also known as Imvamune, JYNNEOS or Imvanex) is a third-generation smallpox vaccine that is authorized and in use as a vaccine against MPX. To date, there are no data showing MPX virus (MPXV)-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals nor vaccine efficacy against MPX. Here we show that MPXV-neutralizing antibodies can be detected after MPXV infection and after historic smallpox vaccination. However, a two-shot MVA-BN immunization series in non-primed individuals yields relatively low levels of MPXV-neutralizing antibodies. Dose-sparing of an MVA-based influenza vaccine leads to lower MPXV-neutralizing antibody levels, whereas a third vaccination with the same MVA-based vaccine significantly boosts the antibody response. As the role of MPXV-neutralizing antibodies as a correlate of protection against disease and transmissibility is currently unclear, we conclude that cohort studies following vaccinated individuals are necessary to assess vaccine efficacy in at-risk populations.",

      "abstract": "The majority of vaccines have been delivered into the muscular tissue. Skin contains large amounts of antigen-presenting cells and has been recognized as a more immunogenic site for vaccine delivery. Intradermal delivery has been approved to improve influenza vaccine efficacy and spare influenza vaccine doses. In response to the recent monkeypox outbreak, intradermal delivery has been also approved to stretch the limited monkeypox vaccine doses to immunize more people at risk. Incorporation of vaccine adjuvants is promising to further increase intradermal vaccine efficacy and spare more vaccine doses. Yet, intradermal vaccination is associated with more significant local reactions than intramuscular vaccination. Thus, adjuvants suitable to boost intradermal vaccination need to have a good local safety without inducing overt local reactions. This review introduces currently approved adjuvants in licensed human vaccines and their relative reactogenicity for intradermal delivery and then introduces emerging chemical and physical adjuvants with a good local safety to boost intradermal vaccination. The rational to develop physical adjuvants, the types of physical adjuvants, and the unique advantages of physical adjuvants to boost intradermal vaccination are also introduced in this review.",

      "abstract": "Memory T cells play a key role in immune protection against cancer. Vaccine-induced tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells in the lung have been shown to protect against lung metastasis. Identifying the source of lung TRM cells can help to improve strategies, preventing tumor metastasis. Here, we found that a prime-boost vaccination approach using intramuscular DNA vaccine priming, followed by intranasal live-attenuated influenza-vectored vaccine (LAIV) boosting induced higher frequencies of lung CD8+ TRM cells compared with other vaccination regimens. Vaccine-induced lung CD8+ TRM cells, but not circulating memory T cells, conferred significant protection against metastatic melanoma and mesothelioma. Central memory T (TCM) cells induced by the DNA vaccination were major precursors of lung TRM cells established after the intranasal LAIV boost. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis indicated that transcriptional reprogramming of TCM cells for differentiation into TRM cells in the lungs started as early as day 2 post the LAIV boost. Intranasal LAIV altered the mucosal microenvironment to recruit TCM cells via CXCR3-dependent chemotaxis and induced CD8+ TRM-associated transcriptional programs. These results identified TCM cells as the source of vaccine-induced CD8+ TRM cells that protect against lung metastasis. Significance: Prime-boost vaccination shapes the mucosal microenvironment and reprograms central memory T cells to generate lung resident memory T cells that protect against lung metastasis, providing insights for the optimization of vaccine strategies.",

In developing mucosal vaccines, the biggest challenge comes from finding safe and effective adjuvants and drug delivery systems. Great progress has been made in the generation of mucosal adjuvants using detoxified bacterial toxin derivatives, pathogen-related molecules, cytokines, and various vaccine delivery systems. However, many problems, relating to the safety and efficacy of mucosal vaccine adjuvants, remain. Certain natural substances can boost the immune response and thus could be used as adjuvants in vaccination. These natural-product-based immune adjuvants have certain advantages over conventional adjuvants, such as low toxicity, high stability, and low cost of production.

      "abstract": "Trained immunity is a long-lasting change in the responsiveness of innate immune cells, leading to a stronger response upon an unrelated secondary challenge. Epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic reprogramming contribute to the development of trained immunity. By investigating the impact of gene variants on trained immunity responses after Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, we identified a strong association between polymorphisms in the RORA gene and BCG-induced trained immunity in PBMCs isolated from healthy human donors. RORα, encoded by the RORA gene in humans, is a nuclear receptor and a transcription factor, regulating genes involved in circadian rhythm, inflammation, cholesterol, and lipid metabolism. We found that natural RORα agonists in the circulation negatively correlate with the strength of trained immunity responses after BCG vaccination. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of RORα in human PBMCs led to higher cytokine production capacity and boosted trained immunity induction by BCG. Blocking RORα activity also resulted in morphological changes and increased ROS and lactate production of BCG-trained cells. Blocking lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and glycolysis with sodium oxamate reduced the cytokine production capacity of cells trained with a combination of BCG and the RORα agonist. In conclusion, this study highlights the potential role of RORα in trained immunity, and its impact on human vaccination and diseases should be further investigated.",

      "abstract": "This Viewpoint presents a case study that explored the effects of using a performance-based Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in public health donor programs to enhance health metrics, program efficiency, and accountability. The MoU between Kebbi State Government in Nigeria and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) focused on strengthening primary healthcare. It covered Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) indicators, overseen by an Operations Committee (OC) and a high-level Steering Committee (SC). Quarterly and biannual reviews tracked indicators through a dashboard developed by the Integrated Health Program (IHP). Results suggest that the MoU led to better monitoring of primary healthcare (PHC) revitalization, health sector work plan harmonization, and data quality. Dashboard tracking showed improved health facility financing, immunization, antenatal care, and skilled attendants at births. The use of the MoU demonstrated potential for boosting program efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and political commitment for resource mobilization in public health initiatives. Results support recommending MoUs as valuable tools for effective outcome-driven public health funding.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines have been one of the most powerful weapons to defend against infectious diseases for a long time now. Subunit vaccines are of increasing importance because of their safety and effectiveness. In this work, a Bacillus amyloliquefaciens spore@zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) vaccine platform is constructed. The ovalbumin (OVA) is encapsulated in the ZIF-8 shells as a model antigen to form a spore@OVA@ZIF-8 (SOZ) composite. The assembly of ZIF-8 improves the loading content of OVA on the spores and provides OVA with long-term protection. The SOZ composite enhances the immunization efficacy in multiple ways, such as facilitation of antigen uptake and lysosome escape, stimulation of dendritic cells to mature and secrete cytokines, boosting of antibody production and formation of an antigen depot. This platform shows several advantages including easy preparation, cost-effectiveness, long life, convenience of transportation and storage, and no need for the cold chain. These findings may have promising implications for the rational design of safe and effective spore-based composite vaccine platforms.",

      "abstract": "Mass vaccination with a safe and effective vaccine may be the best way to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination with the CoronaVac and AZD1222 vaccines may increase the immunogenicity elicited by either vaccine alone. This study sought to compare the immunogenicity of a heterologous CoronaVac and AZD1222 prime-boost with a homologous CoronaVac prime-boost. From July 13 to September 2, 2021, 88 participants were enrolled in the study. Half (n = 44) of the participants were assigned to the AZD1222/CoronaVac cohort and half were assigned to the CoronaVac/AZD1222 cohort. Both cohorts had a prime-boost interval of 4 weeks. A control group of 136 health care personnel who received the homologous CoronaVac/CoronaVac prime-boost was matched by age and sex to the experimental cohorts. The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of the anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody concentration 4 weeks after the booster dose was administered. The CoronaVac/CoronaVac cohort served as the reference group. Baseline age and sex were similar, and the median age was 42.5 years. The GMR was 2.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-3.71) and 8.69 (95% CI 6.05-12.47) in the AZD1222/CoronaVac and CoronaVac/AZD1222 cohorts, respectively. Reactogenicity was similar following prime and booster doses with the same vaccine. Findings indicated that the heterologous CoronaVac and AZD1222 prime-boost combination elicited a more robust immune response than the homologous CoronaVac prime-boost. While both heterologous prime-boost combinations showed similar reactogenicity, the immunogenicity of the CoronaVac/AZD1222 cohort was higher, indicating that the order of prime-boost vaccine administration was important.",

      "abstract": "Enhancing influenza vaccine cross-protection is imperative to alleviate the significant public health burden of influenza. Heterologous sequential immunization may synergize diverse vaccine formulations and routes to improve vaccine potency and breadth. Here we investigate the effects of immunization strategies on the generation of cross-protective immune responses in female Balb/c mice, utilizing mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) and protein-based PHC nanoparticle vaccines targeting influenza hemagglutinin. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of priming vaccination in shaping Th bias and immunodominance hierarchies. mRNA LNP prime favors Th1-leaning responses, while PHC prime elicits Th2-skewing responses. We demonstrate that cellular and mucosal immune responses are pivotal correlates of cross-protection against influenza. Notably, intranasal PHC immunization outperforms its intramuscular counterpart in inducing mucosal immunity and conferring cross-protection. Sequential mRNA LNP prime and intranasal PHC boost demonstrate optimal cross-protection against antigenically drifted and shifted influenza strains. Our study offers valuable insights into tailoring immunization strategies to optimize influenza vaccine effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Maternal anti-respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibodies protect neonates from RSV disease throughout first weeks of life. Previous studies of maternal immunization in cotton rats showed that a single immunization during pregnancy of RSV-primed dams with virus-like particles (VLPs) assembled with pre-fusion F protein and the wild type G protein boosted their RSV serum antibody concentration and protected pups early in life against RSV challenge. We extended these findings by evaluating responses to RSV infection in litters from two consecutive pregnancies of immunized dams. Using an RSV-primed population of VLP-vaccinated and unvaccinated dams, we defined correlations between dams' and litters' RSV neutralizing antibodies (NA); between litters' NA and protection; and between litter's NA and their lung expression of selected cytokines, of a first or of a second pregnancy. Lung pathology was also evaluated. We found positive correlation between the NA titers in the dams at delivery and the NA in their first and second litters and negative correlations between the litters' NA and protection from RSV challenge. Vaccination of dams modulated the mRNA expression for IFNγ and IL-6 and lung pathology in the first and in the second litter at different times after birth, even in the absence of detectable NA. Maternal RSV vaccination enhanced the levels of antibodies transferred to offspring and their protection from challenge. Importantly, maternal vaccination also impacted the immunological and inflammatory response of the offspring's lungs well into maturity, and after the antiviral effect of maternally transferred NA waned or was no longer detectable.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has profound adverse effects on the population on dialysis. Patients requiring dialysis are at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality, and many have experienced psychological distress as well as delayed or suboptimal care. COVID-19 survivors have prolonged viral shedding, but generally develop a robust and long-lasting humoral immune response that correlates with initial disease severity. However, protection against reinfection is incomplete. A growing body of evidence reveals delayed and blunted immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Administration of a third dose within 1 to 2 months of prime-boost vaccination significantly increases antibody levels, in particular in patients with poor initial responses. Patients on dialysis have inferior immune responses to adenoviral vector vaccines than to mRNA vaccines. The immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is markedly better than that of the BNT162b2 vaccine, most likely by virtue of its higher mRNA content. Despite suboptimal immune responses in patients on dialysis, preliminary data suggest that vaccination partially protects against infection and severe disease requiring hospitalization. However, progressive waning of immunity and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with a high potential of immune escape call for a booster dose in all patients on dialysis 4 to 6 months after prime-boost vaccination. Patients with persistent poor vaccine responses may be candidates for primary prophylaxis strategies. In the absence of specific data in patients on dialysis, therapeutic strategies in the event of established COVID-19 must be extrapolated from evidence obtained in the population not on dialysis. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies may be an attractive option after a high-risk exposure or during the early course of infection.",

To fight against the pandemic, robust immune responses induced by vaccination are indispensable. Previously, we developed a subunit vaccine adjuvanted by aluminum hydroxide, ZF2001, based on the dimeric tandem-repeat RBD immunogen, which has been approved for clinical use. This dimeric RBD design was also explored as an mRNA vaccine. Both showed potent immunogenicity. In this study, a DNA vaccine candidate encoding RBD-dimer was designed. The humoral and cellular immune responses induced by homologous and heterologous prime-boost approaches with DNA-RBD-dimer and ZF2001 were assessed in mice. Protection efficacy was studied by the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We found that the DNA-RBD-dimer vaccine was robustly immunogenic. Priming with DNA-RBD-dimer followed by ZF2001 boosting induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than homologous vaccination with either DNA-RBD-dimer or ZF2001, elicited polyfunctional cellular immunity with a T",

      "title": "COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy: ambiguity in decision-making.",
      "abstract": "Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women/people were identified as an at-risk group of severe COVID-19 disease. Consequently, vaccine uptake among this group became a public health priority. However, the relationship between pregnancy and vaccination decision-making is complex, and the heightened uncertainty and anxiety produced through the pandemic further exacerbated this immunization decision. This study explores COVID-19 vaccination decision-making during pregnancy in Aotearoa New Zealand by using an online story completion survey tool. Ninety-five responses were received and analysed using thematic analysis where ambiguity was a core facet within and across stories. Three ambiguities were identified, including who makes the decision (agential), what the risks are (risk) and how immunity to this threat can be best achieved (immunity). We discuss the implications of this ambiguity and how the strong desire to protect the baby persisted across accounts. The recognition of the rather persistent ambiguity in vaccination decision-making helps conceptualize influencing factors taken into account in a more nuanced manner for further research, public health campaigns and health professionals. Future public health campaigns can consider redistributing responsibility for vaccination decision-making in pregnancy, traverse an either/or perspective of 'natural' and 'artificial' immunity-boosting and consider how risk is perceived through anecdotes and viral immediacy.",

      "abstract": "The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the development of multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines expedited vaccine 'mix and match' trials in humans and demonstrated the benefits of mixing vaccines that vary in formulation, strength, and immunogenicity. Heterologous sequential vaccination may be an effective approach for protecting against dengue, as this strategy would mimic the natural route to broad dengue protection and may overcome the imbalances in efficacy of the individual leading live attenuated dengue vaccines. Here we review 'mix and match' vaccination trials against SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and dengue virus and discuss the possible advantages and concerns of future heterologous immunization with the leading dengue vaccines. COVID-19 trials suggest that priming with a vaccine that induces strong cellular responses, such as an adenoviral vectored product, followed by heterologous boost may optimize T cell immunity. Moreover, heterologous vaccination may induce superior humoral immunity compared to homologous vaccination when the priming vaccine induces a narrower response than the boost. The HIV trials reported that heterologous vaccination was associated with broadened antigen responses and that the sequence of the vaccines significantly impacts the regimen's immunogenicity and efficacy. In heterologous dengue immunization trials, where at least one dose was with a live attenuated vaccine, all reported equivalent or increased immunogenicity compared to homologous boost, although one study reported increased reactogenicity. The three leading dengue vaccines have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in thousands of study participants but not in combination in heterologous dengue vaccine trials. Various heterologous regimens including different combinations and sequences should be trialed to optimize cellular and humoral immunity and the breadth of the response while limiting reactogenicity. A blossoming field dedicated to more accurate correlates of protection and enhancement will help confirm the safety and efficacy of these strategies.",

      "abstract": "In France, the goal of the pertussis vaccination program is to protect newborns. All infants are vaccinated under the program and then given booster shots up to the age of 25 years. Pregnant women are likewise vaccinated, with the cocooning strategy reserved for infants born to unvaccinated mothers. Real-world data shows (i) inadequate coverage among adolescents and adults under 25; (ii) improper use of the tetanus, diphtheria, and polio (Td/IPV) vaccine in children under six years, adolescents, and young adults; and (iii) underdiagnosis of pertussis in adults. Older patients or those with specific chronic medical conditions are at risk of developing severe disease. Improving the diagnosis and surveillance of pertussis in adults and seniors would be one of the first steps in the right direction. Aligning pertussis vaccination in adults with the Td/IPV program (boosters at 45, 65 years of age, and then every 10 years) would make the vaccination schedule simpler, easier to understand, and easier to implement. Large-scale awareness campaigns targeting this population would increase coverage, thereby boosting the effectiveness of the other measures.",

      "abstract": "mRNA vaccines have become a versatile technology for the prevention of infectious diseases and the treatment of cancers. In the vaccination process, mRNA formulation and delivery strategies facilitate effective expression and presentation of antigens, and immune stimulation. mRNA vaccines have been delivered in various formats: encapsulation by delivery carriers, such as lipid nanoparticles, polymers, peptides, free mRNA in solution, and ex vivo through dendritic cells. Appropriate delivery materials and formulation methods often boost the vaccine efficacy which is also influenced by the selection of a proper administration route. Co-delivery of multiple mRNAs enables synergistic effects and further enhances immunity in some cases. In this chapter, we overview the recent progress and existing challenges in the formulation and delivery technologies of mRNA vaccines with perspectives for future development.",

      "title": "Off the beaten path: Novel mRNA-nanoformulations for therapeutic vaccination against HIV.",
      "abstract": "Over the last few years, immunotherapy for HIV in general and therapeutic vaccination in particular, has received a tremendous boost, both in preclinical research and in clinical applications. This interest is based on the evidence that the immune system plays a crucial role in controlling HIV infection, as shown for long-term non-progressors and elite controllers, and that immune responses can be manipulated towards targeting conserved epitopes. So far, the most successful approach has been vaccination with autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded ex vivo with antigens and activation signals. Although this approach offers much promise, it also comes with significant drawbacks such as the requirement of a specialized infrastructure and expertise, as well as major challenges for logistics and storage, making it extremely time consuming and costly. Therefore, methods are being developed to avoid the use of ex vivo generated, autologous DCs. One of these methods is based on mRNA for therapeutic vaccination. mRNA has proven to be a very promising vaccine platform, as the coding information for any desired protein, including antigens and activation signals, can be generated in a very short period of time, showing promise both as an off-the-shelf therapy and as a personalized approach. However, an important drawback of this approach is the short half-life of native mRNA, due to the presence of ambient RNases. In addition, proper immunization requires that the antigens are expressed, processed and presented at the right immunological site (e.g. the lymphoid tissues). An ambivalent aspect of mRNA as a vaccine is its capacity to induce type I interferons, which can have beneficial adjuvant effects, but also deleterious effects on mRNA stability and translation. Thus, proper formulation of the mRNA is crucially important. Many approaches for RNA formulation have already been tested, with mixed success. In this review we discuss the state-of-the-art and future trends for mRNA-nanoparticle formulations for HIV vaccination, both in the prophylactic and in the therapeutic setting.",

      "abstract": "To gain insight into how immunity develops against SARS-CoV-2 from 2020 to 2022, we analyzed the immune response of a small group of university staff and students who were either infected or vaccinated. We investigated the levels of receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific and nucleocapsid (N)-specific IgG and IgA antibodies in serum and saliva samples taken early (around 10 days after infection or vaccination) and later (around 1 month later), as well as N-specific T-cell responses. One patient who had been infected in 2020 developed serum RBD and N-specific IgG antibodies, but declined eight months later, then mRNA vaccination in 2021 produced a higher level of anti-RBD IgG than natural infection. In the vaccination of naïve individuals, vaccines induced anti-RBD IgG, but it declined after six months. A third vaccination boosted the IgG level again, albeit to a lower level than after the second. In 2022, when the Omicron variant became dominant, familial transmission occurred among vaccinated people. In infected individuals, the levels of serum anti-RBD IgG antibodies increased later, while anti-N IgG peaked earlier. The N-specific activated T cells expressing IFN γ or CD107a were detected only early. Although SARS-CoV-2-specific salivary IgA was undetectable, two individuals showed a temporary peak in RBD- and N-specific IgA antibodies in their saliva on the second day after infection. Our study, despite having a small sample size, revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers the expected immune responses against acute viral infections. Moreover, our findings suggest that the temporary mucosal immune responses induced early during infection may provide better protection than the currently available intramuscular vaccines.",

      "abstract": "The lungs are constantly exposed to inhaled debris, allergens, pollutants, commensal or pathogenic microorganisms, and respiratory viruses. As a result, innate and adaptive immune responses in the respiratory tract are tightly regulated and are in continual flux between states of enhanced pathogen clearance, immune-modulation, and tissue repair. New single-cell-sequencing techniques are expanding our knowledge of airway cellular complexity and the nuanced connections between structural and immune cell compartments. Understanding these varied interactions is critical in treatment of human pulmonary disease and infections and in next-generation vaccine design. Here, we review the innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung and airways following infection and vaccination, with particular focus on influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put pulmonary research firmly into the global spotlight, challenging previously held notions of respiratory immunity and helping identify new populations at high risk for respiratory distress.",

Here we demonstrate that pre-vaccination with bacteria-derived outer-membrane vesicles, which contain large amounts of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, can be used to potentiate, and enhance, tumour vaccination by trained immunity. Intraperitoneal administration of these outer-membrane vesicles to mice activates inflammasome signalling pathways and induces interleukin-1β secretion. The elevated interleukin-1β increases the generation of antigen-presenting cell progenitors. This results in increased immune response when tumour antigens are delivered, and increases tumour-antigen-specific T-cell activation. This trained immunity increased protection from tumour challenge in two distinct cancer models.",

      "abstract": "Vaccines are the most successful and cost-effective medical interventions available to fight infectious diseases. They consist of biological preparations that are capable of stimulating the immune system to confer protective immunity against a particular harmful pathogen/agent. Vaccine design and development have evolved through the years. Early vaccines were obtained with little implementation of technology and in the absence of fundamental knowledge, representing a pure feat of human ingenuity. In contrast, modern vaccine development takes advantage of advances in technology and in our enhanced understanding of the immune system and host-pathogen interactions. Moreover, vaccine design has found novel applications beyond the prophylactic arena and there is an increasing interest in designing vaccines to treat human ailments like cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases. In this chapter, we focus on prophylactic vaccines against infectious diseases, providing an overview on immunology principles underlying immunization and on how vaccines work and are designed.",

      "title": "Vaccinology: time to change the paradigm?",
      "abstract": "The existing vaccine paradigm assumes that vaccines only protect against the target infection, that effective vaccines reduce mortality corresponding to the target infection's share of total mortality, and that the effects of vaccines are similar for males and females. However, epidemiological vaccine research has generated observations that contradict these assumptions and suggest that vaccines have important non-specific effects on overall health in populations. These include the observations that several live vaccines reduce the incidence of all-cause mortality in vaccinated compared with unvaccinated populations far more than can be explained by protection against the target infections, and that several non-live vaccines are associated with increased all-cause mortality in females. In this Personal View we describe current observations and contradictions and define six emerging principles that might explain them. First, that live vaccines enhance resistance towards unrelated infections. Second, non-live vaccines enhance the susceptibility of girls to unrelated infections. Third, the most recently administered vaccination has the strongest non-specific effects. Fourth, combinations of live and non-live vaccines given together have variable non-specific health effects. Fifth, vaccinating children with live vaccines in the presence of maternal immunity enhances beneficial non-specific effects and reduces mortality. Finally, vaccines might interact with other co-administered health interventions, for example vitamin A supplementation. The potential implications for child health are substantial. For example, if BCG vaccination was given to children at birth, if higher measles vaccination coverage could be obtained, if diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis-containing vaccines were not given with or after measles vaccine, or if the BCG strain with the best non-specific effects could be used consistently, then child mortality could be considerably lower. Pursuing these emerging principles could improve our understanding and use of vaccines globally.",

      "abstract": "Immune responses are tightly regulated yet highly variable between individuals. To investigate human population variation of trained immunity, we immunized healthy individuals with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). This live-attenuated vaccine induces not only an adaptive immune response against tuberculosis but also triggers innate immune activation and memory that are indicative of trained immunity. We established personal immune profiles and chromatin accessibility maps over a 90-day time course of BCG vaccination in 323 individuals. Our analysis uncovered genetic and epigenetic predictors of baseline immunity and immune response. BCG vaccination enhanced the innate immune response specifically in individuals with a dormant immune state at baseline, rather than providing a general boost of innate immunity. This study advances our understanding of BCG's heterologous immune-stimulatory effects and trained immunity in humans. Furthermore, it highlights the value of epigenetic cell states for connecting immune function with genotype and the environment.",

      "abstract": "Adjuvants play pivotal roles in vaccine development, enhancing immunization efficacy through prolonged retention and sustained release of antigen, lymph node targeting, and regulation of dendritic cell activation. Adjuvant-induced activation of innate immunity is achieved via diverse mechanisms: for example, adjuvants can serve as direct ligands for pathogen recognition receptors or as inducers of cell stress and death, leading to the release of immunostimulatory-damage-associated molecular patterns. Adjuvant systems increasingly stimulate multiple innate pathways to induce greater potency. Increased understanding of the principles dictating adjuvant-induced innate immunity will subsequently lead to programming specific types of adaptive immune responses. This tailored optimization is fundamental to next-generation vaccines capable of inducing robust and sustained adaptive immune memory across different cohorts.",

      "abstract": "mRNA vaccines have recently proved to be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2. Key to their success is the lipid-based nanoparticle (LNP), which enables efficient mRNA expression and endows the vaccine with adjuvant properties that drive potent antibody responses. Effective cancer vaccines require long-lived, qualitative CD8 T cell responses instead of antibody responses. Systemic vaccination appears to be the most effective route, but necessitates adaptation of LNP composition to deliver mRNA to antigen-presenting cells. Using a design-of-experiments methodology, we tailored mRNA-LNP compositions to achieve high-magnitude tumor-specific CD8 T cell responses within a single round of optimization. Optimized LNP compositions resulted in enhanced mRNA uptake by multiple splenic immune cell populations. Type I interferon and phagocytes were found to be essential for the T cell response. Surprisingly, we also discovered a yet unidentified role of B cells in stimulating the vaccine-elicited CD8 T cell response. Optimized LNPs displayed a similar, spleen-centered biodistribution profile in non-human primates and did not trigger histopathological changes in liver and spleen, warranting their further assessment in clinical studies. Taken together, our study clarifies the relationship between nanoparticle composition and their T cell stimulatory capacity and provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of effective mRNA-LNP-based antitumor immunotherapy.",

We systematically investigated whether MMR can induce long-term functional changes in innate immune cells, a process termed trained immunity, that could at least partially mediate this heterologous protection. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 39 healthy adults received either the MMR vaccine or a placebo. Using single-cell RNA-Seq, we found that MMR caused transcriptomic changes in CD14+ monocytes and NK cells, but most profoundly in γδ T cells. Monocyte function was not altered by MMR vaccination. In contrast, the function of γδ T cells was markedly enhanced by MMR vaccination, with higher production of TNF and IFN-γ, as well as upregulation of cellular metabolic pathways. In conclusion, we describe a trained immunity program characterized by modulation of γδ T cell function induced by MMR vaccination.",

      "abstract": "Vaccination with small antigens, such as proteins, peptides, or nucleic acids, is used to activate the immune system and trigger the protective immune responses against a pathogen. Currently, nanovaccines are undergoing development instead of conventional vaccines. The size of nanovaccines is in the range of 10-500 nm, which enables them to be readily taken up by cells and exhibit improved safety profiles. However, low-level immune responses, as the removal of redundant pathogens, trigger counter-effective activation of the immune system invalidly and present a challenging obstacle to antigen recognition and its uptake via antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In addition, toxicity can be substantial. To overcome these problems, a variety of cell-penetrating peptide (CPP)-mediated vaccine delivery systems based on nanotechnology have been proposed, most of which are designed to improve the stability of antigens in vivo and their delivery into immune cells. CPPs are particularly attractive components of antigen delivery. Thus, the unique translocation property of CPPs ensures that they remain an attractive carrier with the capacity to deliver cargo in an efficient manner for the application of drugs, gene transfer, protein, and DNA/RNA vaccination delivery. CPP-mediated nanovaccines can enhance antigen uptake, processing, and presentation by APCs, which are the fundamental steps in initiating an immune response.

      "abstract": "Recent estimates suggest that one in two sexually active individuals will acquire a sexually transmitted infection by age 25, an alarming statistic that amounts to over 1 million new infections per day worldwide. Vaccination against STIs is highly desirable for alleviating this global burden of disease. Vaginal immunization is a promising strategy to combat transmission via the vaginal mucosa. The vagina is typically considered a poor inductive site for common correlates of adaptive immunity. However, emerging evidence suggests that immune tolerance may be overcome by precisely engineered vaccination schemes that orchestrate cell-mediated immunity and establish tissue resident memory immune cells. In this review, we will discuss the unique immunological milieu of the vaginal mucosa and our current understanding of correlates of pathogenesis and protection for several common STIs. We then present a summary of recent vaginal vaccine studies and explore the role that mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems play in enhancing protection according to requisite features of immunity. Finally, we offer perspectives on the challenges and future directions of vaginal vaccine delivery, discussing remaining physiological barriers and innovative vaccine formulations that may overcome them.",

      "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapies including cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint blockade or chimeric antigen receptor T cells have been exploited as the attractive treatment modalities in recent years. Among these approaches, cancer vaccines that designed to deliver tumor antigens and adjuvants to activate the antigen presenting cells (APCs) and induce antitumor immune responses, have shown significant efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth, preventing tumor relapse and metastasis. Despite the potential of cancer vaccination strategies, the therapeutic outcomes in preclinical trials are failed to promote their clinical translation, which is in part due to their inefficient vaccination cascade of five critical steps: antigen identification, antigen encapsulation, antigen delivery, antigen release and antigen presentation to T cells. In recent years, it has been demonstrated that various nanobiomaterials hold great potential to enhance cancer vaccination cascade and improve their antitumor performance and reduce the off-target effect. We summarize the cutting-edge advances of nanobiomaterials-based vaccination immunotherapy of cancer in this review. The various cancer nanovaccines including antigen peptide/adjuvant-based nanovaccines, nucleic acid-based nanovaccines as well as biomimetic nanobiomaterials-based nanovaccines are discussed in detail. We also provide some challenges and perspectives associated with the clinical translation of cancer nanovaccines.",

      "abstract": "The adaptive immune response is under circadian control, yet, why adaptive immune reactions continue to exhibit circadian changes over long periods of time is unknown. Using a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling approaches, we show here that dendritic cells migrate from the skin to the draining lymph node in a time-of-day-dependent manner, which provides an enhanced likelihood for functional interactions with T cells. Rhythmic expression of TNF in the draining lymph node enhances BMAL1-controlled ICAM-1 expression in high endothelial venules, resulting in lymphocyte infiltration and lymph node expansion. Lymph node cellularity continues to be different for weeks after the initial time-of-day-dependent challenge, which governs the immune response to vaccinations directed against Hepatitis A virus as well as SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we present a mechanistic understanding of the time-of-day dependent development and maintenance of an adaptive immune response, providing a strategy for using time-of-day to optimize vaccination regimes.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal immunisation includes vaccination in the first 4 weeks of life (Neonatal period) as well as in high-risk preterm infants in the first few months (until 44 weeks corrected gestational age). Neonates have an immature immune system, which renders them highly susceptible to life-threatening infections. This highlights the importance of vaccination in this vulnerable population; however, at the same time also making it challenging because of their inability to generate a protective immune response. Other challenges include interference from maternal antibodies and excessive skewing towards T Helper Cell Type 2 (Th2) immunity. Despite these challenges, several vaccines have been developed and proven safe and effective at birth. Presently, there are 3 vaccines - Hepatitis B vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guerine (BCG) and Oral Polio vaccine (OPV) widely used in neonates, which provides evidence that certain antigen-adjuvant combinations can elicit protective neonatal responses. This review focusses on current vaccinations in neonates, including preterm infants and highlights some novel approaches to enhance neonatal vaccination.",

      "title": "Changes in vaccination administration in Japan.",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews the administration related to vaccination in Japan after the enactment of the Immunization Act in 1948, under which vaccination was implemented mandatory for the public. To enhance the effectiveness of vaccination activities, the government implemented group vaccination, which is convenient for vaccinating recipients all at once. In 1976, Japan established the relief system for health damage after vaccination. While some projects, such as the mass administration of live oral polio vaccine in 1961, achieved excellent results, incidents leading to health damage occurred, such as the diphtheria toxoid immunization incident (1948) and frequent occurrence of aseptic meningitis owing to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (1989). In December 1992, the Tokyo High Court sentenced that the onset of health damage after vaccination could be attributed to the negligence of the national government. In the revision of the Immunization Act in 1994, the \"mandatory vaccination\" enforced until then was changed to \"recommended vaccination.\" The Act was also changed to recommend \"individual vaccination\" in principle, which is performed after primary care physicians investigate the physical condition of individual recipients and carefully conduct preliminary examination. For approximately 20 years from the 1990s, a vaccine gap existed between Japan and other countries. From around 2010, efforts have been made to bridge this gap and establish the global standard in vaccination.",

Vaccine design and development remains critical and involves many aspects, including the choice of platform, antigen, adjuvant, and route of administration. Topical vaccination, defined herein as the introduction of a vaccine to any of the three layers of the human skin, has attracted interest in recent years as an alternative vaccination approach to the conventional intramuscular administration because of its potential to be needle-free and induce a superior immune response against pathogens. In this review, we describe recent progress in developing topical vaccines, highlight progress in the development of delivery technologies for topical vaccines, discuss potential factors that might impact the topical vaccine efficacy, and provide an overview of the current clinical landscape of topical vaccines.",

The mechanical and cellular changes enabling the early-stage expansion of lymph nodes have been characterized, yet the durability of such responses and their implications for adaptive immunity and vaccine efficacy are unknown. Here, by leveraging high-frequency ultrasound imaging of the lymph nodes of mice, we report more potent and persistent lymph-node expansion for animals immunized with a mesoporous silica vaccine incorporating a model antigen than for animals given bolus immunization or standard vaccine formulations such as alum, and that durable and robust lymph-node expansion was associated with vaccine efficacy and adaptive immunity for 100 days post-vaccination in a mouse model of melanoma. Immunization altered the mechanical and extracellular-matrix properties of the lymph nodes, drove antigen-dependent proliferation of immune and stromal cells, and altered the transcriptional features of dendritic cells and inflammatory monocytes. Strategies that robustly maintain lymph-node expansion may result in enhanced vaccination outcomes.",

      "title": "Adjuvants for swine vaccines: Mechanisms of actions and adjuvant effects.",
      "abstract": "This review deals with mechanisms of actions (MOA) and adjuvant effects of various types of adjuvants for swine vaccines. A number of different types of adjuvants have been tested with swine vaccines, including oil emulsion, particulate antigen (Ag) carrier, cytokines, pathogen-associated molecular patterns and immune ligands, saponins, and bacterial cells and toxins. In addition, there are a number of chemicals and natural products that possess adjuvant activities when tested with swine vaccines, and are grouped as miscellaneous in this review. The MOA of adjuvants can be generally divided into two categories: delivery vehicles and immunostimulants. Adjuvants serving as delivery vehicle can act as a depot, help deliver Ag to the draining lymph nodes, promote Ag uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and protect Ag from harsh conditions. Adjuvants possessing immunostimulatory activities may help recruit and activate APCs and T cells, enhance APC functions, and direct T cell differentiation and immunoglobulin isotype switching. Success of adjuvant use on improving immunogenicity and protective efficacy of swine vaccines depends on several factors, including type and stability of vaccine Ag, dose and schedule of vaccination, MOA of adjuvant, route, dose and schedule of adjuvant administration, type of immune response required, and safety from adverse reactions. In addition to the above mentioned factors, cost effectiveness is of concern. Further studies of swine vaccine adjuvants may need to focus on characterization of their MOA and search for more potential adjuvant candidates that can induce mucosal immune response.",

      "abstract": "Intranasal vaccines are anticipated to be powerful tools for combating many infectious diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, because they induce not only systemic immunity but also mucosal immunity at the site of initial infection. However, they are generally inefficient in inducing an antigen-specific immune response without adjuvants. Here, we developed an adjuvant-free intranasal vaccine platform that utilizes the preexisting immunity induced by previous infection or vaccination to enhance vaccine effectiveness. We made RBD-HA, a fusion of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike derived from SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine target with HA derived from influenza A virus (IAV) as a carrier protein. Intranasal immunization of previously IAV-infected mice with RBD-HA without an adjuvant elicited robust production of RBD-specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA by utilizing both HA-specific preexisting IgG and CD4+ T cells. Consequently, the mice were efficiently protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we demonstrated the high versatility of this intranasal vaccine platform by assessing various vaccine antigens and preexisting immunity associated with a variety of infectious diseases. The results of this study suggest the promising potential of this intranasal vaccine platform to address problems associated with intranasal vaccines.",

      "title": "Vaccine literacy: A concept analysis.",
      "abstract": "The 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is dubbed as one of the deadliest and worst global pandemics. Many pandemic policies and programs were implemented in different countries across the globe, including the creation of vaccines that would enhance human immunity against the symptoms caused by the virus. Since then, debates on vaccines have emerged, citing vaccine hesitancy often associated with certain factors like socioeconomic status, beliefs, and vaccine awareness. This birthed to an intensive call for vaccine literacy as an effective means of encouraging people to get vaccinated against viruses. This paper uses the Walker and Avant's (2019, Strategies for theory construction in nursing, 6th edn. New York, NY: Pearson) approach of concept analysis with the help of its eight systematic stages. Results showed that vaccine literacy was adopted after the concept of health literacy. It is defined as a process of providing vaccine information, building communication, and increasing people's engagement about vaccines. The identified defining attributes of vaccine literacy include 'health literacy', 'disease prevention', 'education', and 'immunization'. Vaccine literacy is considered relevant in the nursing practice as knowledge on vaccine literacy easily advances nurses' practice roles through vaccination education, creating developmental policies about vaccines, and prescribing immunization to patients.",

      "abstract": "Many pathogens enter the host through mucosal sites. Thus, interfering with pathogen entry through local neutralization at mucosal sites therefore is an effective strategy for preventing disease. Mucosally administered vaccines have the potential to induce protective immune responses at mucosal sites. This manuscript delves into some of the latest developments in mucosal vaccination, particularly focusing on advancements in adjuvant technologies and the role of these adjuvants in enhancing vaccine efficacy against respiratory pathogens. It highlights the anatomical and immunological complexities of the respiratory mucosal immune system, emphasizing the significance of mucosal secretory IgA and tissue-resident memory T cells in local immune responses. We further discuss the differences between immune responses induced through traditional parenteral vaccination approaches vs. mucosal administration strategies, and explore the protective advantages offered by immunization through mucosal routes.",

It covered Health Systems Strengthening (HSS) indicators, overseen by an Operations Committee (OC) and a high-level Steering Committee (SC). Quarterly and biannual reviews tracked indicators through a dashboard developed by the Integrated Health Program (IHP). Results suggest that the MoU led to better monitoring of primary healthcare (PHC) revitalization, health sector work plan harmonization, and data quality. Dashboard tracking showed improved health facility financing, immunization, antenatal care, and skilled attendants at births. The use of the MoU demonstrated potential for boosting program efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and political commitment for resource mobilization in public health initiatives.

      "title": "Mucosal immunity and vaccination strategies: current insights and future perspectives.",
      "abstract": "The mucosal immune system represents a critical defense mechanism, safeguarding the body from an array of external pathogens. As the body's first line of immune protection, it plays an essential role in initiating both innate and adaptive immune responses. Through intricate networks of immune cells and complex molecular pathways, mucosal immunity orchestrates a robust defense not only at the local level but also activates systemic immune responses to ensure comprehensive protection. Consequently, the mucosal immune system has garnered immense interest in the field of vaccine development, given its potential to foster durable and effective immunization. Despite the profound promise of mucosal immunity, the development of mucosal vaccines faces significant challenges, particularly with existing technological platforms that primarily rely on live attenuated or inactivated vaccines. However, emerging innovative platforms, including subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and the groundbreaking application of mRNA vaccines, are offering new perspectives, vastly improving the scope and efficacy of mucosal immunization. As mucosal immunity research continues to evolve, rapid advancements in biotechnology and immunology provide promising strategies to enhance immune responses and overcome inherent limitations. This review delves into the latest progress in oral, nasal, and other forms of mucosal vaccines, analyzing the intricate relationship between mucosal immune characteristics and vaccine design. Emphasis is placed on the pivotal role of advanced adjuvants and delivery systems in maximizing vaccine efficacy. This review addresses current challenges, highlights future research opportunities, and aims to provide a comprehensive framework for advancing the field of mucosal immunity and vaccine development.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to better understand barriers and enabling conditions for HPV vaccination in school-based vaccination programs in Canada. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone or in person with parents, nurses, and school staff (n = 50) in three Canadian provinces. Interviews explored views on HPV and HPV vaccination, strengths and weaknesses of the school-based HPV vaccination programs and proposed interventions to increase uptake. Interview transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically using the socio-ecological model. Participants had positive views towards HPV vaccination and school-based offer. They identified barriers and enabling conditions at the individual and interpersonal level (e.g., knowledge, attitudes, behaviours of - and relationships between - parents, nurses, and school personnel), at the organizational level (e.g., allocated resources, information provision, process to ensure informed consent, vaccination setting and environment) and at the community and policy level (e.g., social group values and norms, media coverage around the HPV vaccine). Participants also suggested strategies to reduce identified barriers (e.g., communication interventions, simpler inform consent process). Different layers of barriers and enabling conditions of HPV vaccination in school settings were identified. Tailored interventions remain key to enhance vaccine acceptance and uptake.",

      "abstract": "In the last century, we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of older persons globally, a trend known as the grey (or silver) tsunami. People live markedly longer than their predecessors worldwide, due to remarkable changes in their lifestyle and in progresses made by modern medicine. However, the older we become, the more susceptible we are to a series of age-related pathologies, including infections, cancers, autoimmune diseases, and multi-morbidities. Therefore, a key challenge for our modern societies is how to cope with this fragile portion of the population, so that everybody could have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life. From a holistic point of view, aging results from the progressive decline of various systems. Among them, the distinctive age-dependent changes in the immune system contribute to the enhanced frailty of the elderly. One of these affects a population of lymphocytes, known as regulatory T cells (Tregs), as accumulating evidence suggest that there is a significant increase in the frequency of these cells in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs) of aged animals. Although there are still discrepancies in the literature about modifications to their functional properties during aging, mounting evidence suggests a detrimental role for Tregs in the elderly in the context of bacterial and viral infections by suppressing immune responses against non-self-antigens. Interestingly, Tregs seem to also contribute to the reduced effectiveness of immunizations against many pathogens by limiting the production of vaccine-induced protective antibodies. In this review, we will analyze the current state of understandings about the role of Tregs in acute and chronic infections as well as in vaccination response in both humans and mice. Lastly, we provide an overview of current strategies for Treg modulation with potential future applications to improve the effectiveness of vaccines in older individuals.",

Most vaccines are administered through the parenteral route and can elicit a robust systemic humoral response, but they induce a weak T-cell-mediated immunity and are poor inducers of mucosal protection. Considering that most pathogens enter the body through mucosal surfaces, a vaccine that elicits protection in the first site of contact between the host and the pathogen is promising. However, despite the advantages of mucosal vaccines as good options to confer protection on the mucosal surface, only a few mucosal vaccines are currently approved. In this review, we discuss the impact of vaccine administration in different mucosal surfaces; how appropriate adjuvants enhance the induction of protective mucosal immunity and other factors that can influence the mucosal immune response to vaccines.",

      "abstract": "Vaccination programmes provide a safe, effective and cost-efficient strategy for maintaining population health. In veterinary medicine, vaccination not only reduces disease within animal populations but also serves to enhance public health by targeting zoonoses. Nevertheless, for many pathogens, an effective vaccine remains elusive. Recently, nanovaccines have proved to be successful for various infectious and non-infectious diseases of animals. These novel technologies, such as virus-like particles, self-assembling proteins, polymeric nanoparticles, liposomes and virosomes, offer great potential for solving many of the vaccine production challenges. Their benefits include low immunotoxicity, antigen stability, enhanced immunogenicity, flexibility sustained release and the ability to evoke both humoral and cellular immune responses. Nanovaccines are more efficient than traditional vaccines due to ease of control and plasticity in their physio-chemical properties. They use a highly targeted immunological approach which can provide strong and long-lasting immunity. This article reviews the currently available nanovaccine technology and considers its utility for both infectious diseases and non-infectious diseases such as auto-immunity and cancer. Future research opportunities and application challenges from bench to clinical usage are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Mucosal antibodies play a key role in protection against breakthrough COVID-19 infections and emerging viral variants. Intramuscular adenovirus-based vaccination (Vaxzevria) only weakly induces nasal IgG and IgA responses, unless vaccinees have been previously infected. However, little is known about how Vaxzevria vaccination impacts the ability of mucosal antibodies to induce Fc responses, particularly against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoCs). Here, we profiled paired mucosal (saliva, tears) and plasma antibodies from COVID-19 vaccinated only vaccinees (uninfected, vaccinated) and COVID-19 recovered vaccinees (COVID-19 recovered, vaccinated) who both received Vaxzevria vaccines. SARS-CoV-2 ancestral-specific IgG antibodies capable of engaging FcγR3a were significantly higher in the mucosal samples of COVID-19 recovered Vaxzevria vaccinees in comparison with vaccinated only vaccinees. However, when IgG and FcγR3a engaging antibodies were tested against a panel of SARS-CoV-2 VoCs, the responses were ancestral-centric with weaker recognition of Omicron strains observed. In contrast, salivary IgA, but not plasma IgA, from Vaxzevria vaccinees displayed broad cross-reactivity across all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs tested. Our data highlight that while intramuscular Vaxzevria vaccination can enhance mucosal antibodies responses in COVID-19 recovered vaccinees, restrictions by ancestral-centric bias may have implications for COVID-19 protection. However, highly cross-reactive mucosal IgA could be key in addressing these gaps in mucosal immunity and may be an important focus of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development.",

      "abstract": "Despite vaccines being instrumental in reducing vaccine-preventable disease, adult vaccination rates in the United States (US) are below optimal levels. To better understand factors affecting vaccination rates, we analyzed trends in adult vaccination coverage using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and conducted a targeted literature review (TLR) on interventions to improve adult vaccination rates in the US. Both the BRFSS analysis and the TLR focused on influenza; pneumococcal disease; tetanus and diphtheria or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis; herpes zoster; and human papillomavirus vaccination for US adults aged 18-64 years. The TLR additionally included hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination. Vaccination coverage rates (VCRs) and changes in VCRs were calculated using the 2011-2019 BRFSS survey data. For the TLR, the MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process databases were searched for articles on vaccination interventions published between January 2015 and June 2021. The BRFSS analysis showed that changes in VCRs were generally modest and positive for most states over the study period. The TLR included 32 articles that met the eligibility criteria; intervention strategies that improved adult vaccination outcomes incorporated an educational component, vaccination reminders or reinforcement at the point of care, or authorized non-clinician members of the healthcare team to vaccinate. Furthermore, interventions combining more than one approach appeared to enhance effectiveness. The strategies identified in this TLR will be valuable for policymakers and stakeholders to inform the development and implementation of evidence-based policies and practices to improve adult vaccination coverage.",

Quzhou City has gradually transitioned from DTwP to DTaP vaccines, achieving a remarkable vaccination coverage rate of 99%. However, since 2024, there has been a significant surge in pertussis cases in Quzhou City. We collected data on pertussis cases, described the epidemiological characteristics of pertussis outbreaks in Quzhou City, examined pertussis vaccination history, and conducted a COX survival analysis. Pertussis cases reported in Quzhou City from January to April 2024 were far higher than those reported in previous years during the same period. Geographically, cases were concentrated in the central region and predominantly affected children under 9 years old, with a focus on the 5-9 age group. Survival analysis revealed that the risk of pertussis incidence increased by 2.84 times (HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 2.27 ~ 3.63) when comparing self-paid vaccines to free vaccines. The pertussis situation in Quzhou City remains critical, emphasizing the need for enhanced immunization strategies and further optimization of pertussis immunization protocols.",

Recently, infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged in China, and were then transmitted all over the world, causing the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is transmitted at a higher rate than other diseases caused by coronaviruses. At the time of writing this review, COVID-19 is not contained in most countries in spite of quarantine, physical distancing, and enhanced hygiene measures. In this review, I address different methods for passive and active immunization against this virus, which is known to cause fatal respiratory disease, including natural passive immunization by breast milk, natural active immunization by herd immunization, artificial passive immunization by convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies, and artificial active immunization by vaccination. I hope this review will help design a prophylactic approach against outbreaks and pandemics of related coronaviruses in the future.",

      "abstract": "Antibodies and humoral memory are key components of the adaptive immune system. We consider and computationally model mechanisms by which humoral memory present at baseline might increase rather than decrease infection load; we refer to this effect as EI-HM (enhancement of infection by humoral memory). We first consider antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in which antibody enhances the growth of the pathogen, typically a virus, and typically at intermediate 'Goldilocks' levels of antibody. Our ADE model reproduces ADE in vitro and enhancement of infection in vivo from passive antibody transfer. But notably the simplest implementation of our ADE model never results in EI-HM. Adding complexity, by making the cross-reactive antibody much less neutralizing than the de novo generated antibody or by including a sufficiently strong non-antibody immune response, allows for ADE-mediated EI-HM. We next consider the possibility that cross-reactive memory causes EI-HM by crowding out a possibly superior de novo immune response. We show that, even without ADE, EI-HM can occur when the cross-reactive response is both less potent and 'directly' (i.e. independently of infection load) suppressive with regard to the de novo response. In this case adding a non-antibody immune response to our computational model greatly reduces or completely eliminates EI-HM, which suggests that 'crowding out' is unlikely to cause substantial EI-HM. Hence, our results provide examples in which simple models give qualitatively opposite results compared to models with plausible complexity. Our results may be helpful in interpreting and reconciling disparate experimental findings, especially from dengue, and for vaccination.",

Animal models, commonly used to study immunomodulatory agents, are limited by species-specific differences, low throughput, and ethical concerns. In contrast, in vitro modeling of human immune responses can enable species- and population-specific mechanistic studies and translational development within the same study participant. Translational accuracy of in vitro models is enhanced by accounting for genetic, epigenetic, and demographic features such as age, sex, and comorbidity. This review explores various human in vitro immune models, considers evidence that they may resemble human in vivo responses, and assesses their potential to accelerate and de-risk vaccine discovery and development.",

      "abstract": "Despite intense elimination efforts, tuberculosis (TB) still poses a threat to world health, disproportionately affecting less developed and poorer countries. The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, the only anti-TB authorized vaccine can partially stop TB infection and transmission, however, its effectiveness ranges from 0 to 80%. As a result, there is an urgent need for a more potent TB vaccination given the widespread incidence of the disease. Enhancing BCG's effectiveness is also important due to the lack of other licensed vaccinations. Recently, fascinating research into BCG revaccination techniques by modulating its mode of action i.e., intravenous (IV) BCG delivery has yielded good clinical outcomes showing it still has a place in current vaccination regimens. We must thus go over the recent evidence that suggests trained immunity, and BCG vaccination techniques and describe how the vaccination confers protection against bacteria that cause both TB and non-tuberculosis. This review of the literature offers an updated summary and viewpoints on BCG-based TB immunization regimens (how it affects granulocytes at the epigenetic and hematopoietic stem cell levels which may be related to its efficacy), and also examines how the existing vaccine is being modified to be more effective, which may serve as an inspiration for future studies on the development of TB vaccines.",

      "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy relies on unleashing the patient´s immune system against tumor cells. Cancer vaccines aim to stimulate both the innate and adaptive arms of immunity to achieve durable clinical responses. Some roadblocks for a successful cancer vaccine in the clinic include the tumor antigen of choice, the adjuvants employed to strengthen antitumor-specific immune responses, and the risks associated with enhancing immune-related adverse effects in patients. Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) belongs to the family of poxviruses and is a versatile vaccine platform that combines several attributes crucial for cancer therapy. First, MVA is an excellent inducer of innate immune responses leading to type I interferon secretion and induction of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) immune responses. Second, it elicits robust and durable humoral and cellular immunity against vector-encoded heterologous antigens. Third, MVA has enormous genomic flexibility, which allows for the expression of multiple antigenic and costimulatory entities. And fourth, its replication deficit in human cells ensures a excellent safety profile. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how MVA induces innate and adaptive immune responses. Furthermore, we will give an overview of the tumor-associated antigens and immunomodulatory molecules that have been used to armor MVA and describe their clinical use. Finally, the route of MVA immunization and its impact on therapeutic efficacy depending on the immunomodulatory molecules expressed will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Infection is the predominant cause of mortality in early life, and immunization is the most promising biomedical intervention to reduce this burden. However, very young infants fail to respond optimally to most vaccines currently in use, especially neonates. In 2005, Stanley Plotkin proposed that new delivery systems would spur a new revolution in pediatric vaccinology, just as attenuation, inactivation, cell culture of viruses, genetic engineering, and adjuvantation had done in preceding decades. Recent advances in the field of immunoengineering, which is evolving alongside vaccinology, have begun to increasingly influence vaccine formulation design. Historically, the particulate nature of materials used in many vaccine formulations was empiric, often because of the need to stabilize antigens or reduce endotoxin levels. However, present vaccine delivery systems are rationally engineered to mimic the size, shape, and surface chemistry of pathogens, and are therefore often referred to as \"pathogen-like particles\". More than a decade from his original assessment, we re-assess Plotkin's prediction. In addition, we highlight how immunoengineering and advanced delivery systems may be uniquely capable of enhancing vaccine responses in vulnerable populations, such as infants. IMPACT: Immunoengineering and advanced delivery systems are leading to new developments in pediatric vaccinology. Summarizes delivery systems currently in use and development, and prospects for the future.

      "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The implementation of primary prevention aims to reduce the burden of HPV infection and HPV-related disease. However, HPV-related diseases are still a concern, even in high-income countries. Approximately 570 000 new cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in Italy every year. Prophylactic HPV vaccines have been developed to minimize the spread of HPV. Growing evidence supports the administration of HPV vaccines (even just one dose) in reducing the prevalence of HPV infection and HPV-related disease including cancers. HPV vaccines are characterized by a high level of efficacy (>95%) in women who are naïve to HPV; however, they do not increase clearance in patients with ongoing HPV infection. With more than 200 million doses administered to date, HPV vaccines are considered to be safe and effective at preventing HPV-related infections and cancers. In this review we aim to review the current evidence regarding HPV vaccination and to describe trends in HPV vaccination coverage in Italy. In Italy, vaccination against HPV has been included in the National Immunization Plan (NIP) since 2007-2008. Using data abstracted from the Italian Ministry of Health, we analyzed changes in HPV vaccination coverage. We observed that HPV vaccines are underutilized and coverage rates are decreasing. Looking at the target population (females and males aged 11-12 years) in Italy, a decrease in coverage rates was observed. A call for action, improved HPV awareness, and education are the key elements to enhance the widespread adoption of HPV vaccination.",

      "title": "The immunological impact of revaccination in a hybrid-immune world.",
      "abstract": "The global immune landscape of SARS-CoV-2 has progressively shifted from a naïve population several years ago to a population that possesses immunity to the virus through infection, vaccination, or a combination of both, known as hybrid immunity. Hybrid immunity offers a prolonged period of transmission-blocking activity, likely related to enhanced tissue-resident immunity, but also has been shown to be linked to broader humoral and cellular immune responses. Compared with vaccination or infection alone, the collective data have demonstrated that hybrid immunity offers enhanced protection against disease. Yet, despite the benefits of hybrid immunity, perpetual evolution of variants and the natural waning of immunity in vulnerable populations provides a strong rationale for revaccination. This article reviews the benefits of revaccination, including updating variant-specific immunity, bolstering humoral and cellular immune frequencies in those with hybrid immunity, and overcoming immune imprinting and enhancing effector mechanisms to raise surveillance and defense against the virus. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, updated booster vaccinations remain essential to enhance and sustain protection from disease by ensuring that the immune system is equipped to respond to contemporary strains, thereby reducing the impact of future outbreaks and mitigating the burden of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations.",

      "title": "Intranasal vaccine: Factors to consider in research and development.",
      "abstract": "Most existing vaccines for human use are administered by needle-based injection. Administering vaccines needle-free intranasally has numerous advantages over by needle-based injection, but there are only a few intranasal vaccines that are currently approved for human use, and all of them are live attenuated influenza virus vaccines. Clearly, there are immunological as well as non-immunological challenges that prevent vaccine developers from choosing the intranasal route of administration. We reviewed current approved intranasal vaccines and pipelines and described the target of intranasal vaccines, i.e. nose and lymphoid tissues in the nasal cavity. We then analyzed factors unique to intranasal vaccines that need to be considered when researching and developing new intranasal vaccines. We concluded that while the choice of vaccine formulations, mucoadhesives, mucosal and epithelial permeation enhancers, and ligands that target M-cells are important, safe and effective intranasal mucosal vaccine adjuvants are needed to successfully develop an intranasal vaccine that is not based on live-attenuated viruses or bacteria. Moreover, more effective intranasal vaccine application devices that can efficiently target a vaccine to lymphoid tissues in the nasal cavity as well as preclinical animal models that can better predict intranasal vaccine performance in clinical trials are needed to increase the success rate of intranasal vaccines in clinical trials.",

Innate immunity occurs immediately while adaptive immunity develops upon pathogen exposure, and is long-lasting, highly specific, and sustained by memory T cells. Respiratory virus infection typically induces effective immunity but over-exuberant responses are associated with pathophysiology. Cytokines expressed in response to viral infection can enhance biological responses, activate, and trigger signaling pathways leading to adaptive immunity Vaccines induce immunity, specifically B and T cell responses. Vaccination is generally efficacious, but for many viruses, our understanding of vaccination strategies and immunity is incomplete or in its infancy.

This review highlights sleep's instrumental biological functions, various sleep problems, and sleep hygiene and lifestyle interventions that can help improve sleep quality. Quality sleep allows for improved cardiovascular health, mental health, cognition, memory consolidation, immunity, reproductive health, and hormone regulation. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep apnea, and circadian-rhythm-disorders, or disrupted sleep from lifestyle choices, environmental conditions, or other medical issues can lead to significant morbidity and can contribute to or exacerbate medical and psychiatric conditions. The best treatment for long-term sleep improvement is proper sleep hygiene through behavior and sleep habit modification. Recommendations to improve sleep include achieving 7 to 9 h of sleep, maintaining a consistent sleep/wake schedule, a regular bedtime routine, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting a contemplative practice. In addition, avoiding many substances late in the day can help improve sleep. Caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and light exposure later in the day are associated with fragmented poor-quality sleep. These sleep hygiene practices can promote better quality and duration of sleep, with corresponding health benefits.",

While historically viewed as a passive site for energy storage, we now appreciate that adipose tissue regulates many aspects of whole-body physiology, including food intake, maintenance of energy levels, insulin sensitivity, body temperature, and immune responses. A crucial property of adipose tissue is its high degree of plasticity. Physiologic stimuli induce dramatic alterations in adipose-tissue metabolism, structure, and phenotype to meet the needs of the organism. Limitations to this plasticity cause diminished or aberrant responses to physiologic cues and drive the progression of cardiometabolic disease along with other pathological consequences of obesity.",

      "abstract": "University students experience high prevalence of mental health problems and exacerbation of mental health difficulties, including sleep disturbances and stress during their studies. Stress and poor sleep quality and/or insomnia are interlinked outcomes for this population. The aim was to conduct a systematic review, and meta-analyses, of the relationships between sleep quality and/or insomnia with stress in students. Full-text articles of studies exploring the associations of stress with poor sleep quality and/or insomnia in undergraduate students using validated tools and published in peer-reviewed journals were eligible for inclusion. Thirty-four studies, resulting in 37 effect sizes, included and all were suitable for meta-analysis. The weighted pooled effect size between sleep quality and stress was for 0.39 (25 studies, n = 10,065), whereas a slightly higher pooled association of 0.41 was demonstrated for insomnia and stress (12 studies, n = 5564.5). Pooled associations show moderate effects for associations between sleep quality, insomnia and stress in undergraduate students. High heterogeneity in meta-analyses was found, suggesting the findings should be considered cautiously. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies exploring sleep difficulties across the academic year, whilst university services should consider psychoeducation for stress and sleep in university students, especially during transition to university.",

      "abstract": "While sleep serves important regulatory functions for mental health, sleep disturbances, in particular insomnia, may favour a state of allostatic overload impairing brain neuroplasticity and stress immune pathways, hence contributing to mental disorders. In this framework, the aim of this work was to link current understanding about insomnia mechanisms with current knowledge about mental health dysregulatory mechanisms. The focus of the present work was on mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, which represent important challenges in clinical practice. Literature searches were conducted on clinical, neurobiological, and therapeutic implications for insomnia comorbid with these mental disorders. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the existing literature, we ended up with a narrative review. Insomnia may play an important role as a risk factor, a comorbid condition and transdiagnostic symptom for many mental disorders including mood/anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. Insomnia may also play a role as a marker of disrupted neuroplasticity contributing to dysregulation of different neurobiological mechanisms involved in these different mental conditions. In this framework, insomnia treatment may not only foster normal sleep processes but also the stress system, neuroinflammation and brain plasticity. Insomnia treatment may play an important preventive and neuroprotective role with cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia being the treatment with important new evidence of efficacy for insomnia, psychopathology, and indices of disrupted neuroplasticity. On the other hand, pharmacological pathways for insomnia treatment in these mental conditions are still not well defined. Therapeutic options acting on melatonergic systems and new therapeutic options acting on orexinergic systems may represents interesting pathways of interventions that may open new windows on insomnia treatment in mental disorders.",

Disruption of any of these interlocked features is broadly pathogenic, causing an acute or progressive derailment of the system coupled to the loss of numerous stigmata of health.",

Food and nutrition, essential in maintenance of brain performance, also aid in prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Both the overall composition of the human diet and specific dietary components have been shown to have an impact on brain function in various experimental models and epidemiological studies. This narrative review provides an overview of the role of diet in 5 key areas of brain function related to mental health and performance, including: (1) brain development, (2) signaling networks and neurotransmitters in the brain, (3) cognition and memory, (4) the balance between protein formation and degradation, and (5) deteriorative effects due to chronic inflammatory processes. Finally, the role of diet in epigenetic regulation of brain physiology is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Reproductive issues are becoming an increasing global problem. There is increasing interest in the relationship between microbiota and reproductive health. Stable microbiota communities exist in the gut, reproductive tract, uterus, testes, and semen. Various effects (e.g., epigenetic modifications, nervous system, metabolism) of dysbiosis in the microbiota can impair gamete quality; interfere with zygote formation, embryo implantation, and embryo development; and increase disease susceptibility, thus adversely impacting reproductive capacity and pregnancy. The maintenance of a healthy microbiota can protect the host from pathogens, increase reproductive potential, and reduce the rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. In conclusion, this review discusses microbiota in the male and female reproductive systems of multiple animal species. It explores the effects and mechanisms of microbiota on reproduction, factors that influence microbiota composition, and applications of microbiota in reproductive disorder treatment and detection. The findings support novel approaches for managing reproductive diseases through microbiota improvement and monitoring. In addition, it will stimulate further systematic explorations of microbiota-mediated effects on reproduction.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been previously proven to have various health-related benefits; however, its effect on women's reproductive health over a lifespan is yet to be summarized. This study aimed to summarize the evidence-based knowledge regarding the association between the MD and selected reproductive health outcomes. By searching PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, as well as reference lists, 21 studies were included in this narrative review. The available evidence was very limited; however, there is some suggestion that higher adherence to the MD may be positively associated with a lower risk of early age menarche (1 study) and shorter menstrual cycles (1 study), but is unrelated to dysmenorrhea (1 study). Moreover, no study to date has examined the relationship between the MD and the onset age of natural menopause. Considering reproductive health diseases, there was limited evidence that a higher adherence to the MD was associated with a lower risk of premenstrual syndrome (1 study), an improvement in sexual health and a lower prevalence of sexual dysfunction (3 studies), and an improvement in the general condition of with endometriosis and the pain they can experience (1 study). The largest number of studies were found for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS; 7 studies) and infertility (6 studies). Results showed that a higher adherence to the MD was associated with a lower risk of infertility, while results for PCOS were unclear, but mostly indicated a beneficial trend. Further investigations are necessary to establish the role of adherence to the MD in reproductive health maintenance and its possible role in the prevention and treatment of reproductive health diseases in women.",

Women have a higher prevalence of insomnia disorder and restless legs syndrome (RLS) versus men, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is more likely as women age. Hormonal transitions are important to consider in women's sleep. For women, insomnia, OSA, and RLS are predictive of depression, and insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing are predictive of Alzheimer disease. These findings underscore the importance of assessment, treatment, and future research examining sleep and mental health in women, given their unique and increased vulnerability.",

The purpose of this review is to bring our discussion to a wider audience. The meeting could not have been more timely. Six weeks later, the COVID-19 emergency emerged in China and within 12 months it had swept the world. This paper, the contents of which were presented at that meeting in December recommended that future healthcare would be guided more by public health perspectives and informed by an understanding of health economics, population health and the lessons learned by psychiatry in the 20th century.

      "title": "Recall and Oral Health Maintenance.",
      "abstract": "The aim of this chapter is to discuss current evidence and clinical protocols for recall and maintenance in patients who have undergone non-invasive and/or invasive treatment for erosive tooth wear. There is a paucity of research and evidence for some of the suggested protocols, and some sections are based on clinical experience. Recall for patients who have undergone non-invasive treatment is either for behavioural change and/or monitoring of progression of tooth wear. Behaviour change needs to be patient centred and holistic, with an individualised plan. Recall is essential to assess adherence to any behavioural change plans and advice, as well as any change in the patient's risk category. If the patient has active signs or symptoms associated with erosive tooth wear progression, such as dentine hypersensitivity, symptomatic reflux or an active eating disorder, it is prudent to review the patient after 3 months. If the recall visit is mainly cantered around assessing progression of the wear, periods between 1 and 3 years depending on the presumed aetiology of the patient are appropriate with the current methods of assessing progression, including intraoral scans and various indices. The main aims are to identify the risks, reduce the risks and ensure the progression of wear is stabilised. In cases where invasive treatment has been carried out, the non-invasive recall and maintenance still apply. In addition, the recall visits entail repair or replacement of restorations. In general, the most minimally invasive approach that is accepted by the patients should be attempted, such as monitoring stained margins, repair of restorations to prolong the lifespan of the restoration or in some cases progression to more invasive restorations, all depending on the patient's wishes and the goal of improving quality of life.",

      "title": "Reproductive one health in primates.",
      "abstract": "One Health is a collaborative trans-disciplinary approach to health; integrating human, animal, and environmental health. The focus is often on infection disease transmission and disease risk mitigation. However, One Health also includes the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to disease investigation and health of humans, animals, and the environment. One key aspect of environmental/ecosystem health is conservation, the maintenance of healthy, actively reproducing wildlife populations. Reproduction and reproductive health are an integral part of the One Health approach: the comparative aspects of reproduction can inform conservation policies or breeding strategies (in situ and ex situ) in addition to physiology and disease. Differences in reproductive strategies affect the impact poaching and habitat disruption might have on a given population, as well as ex situ breeding programs and the management of zoo and sanctuary populations. Much is known about chimpanzees, macaques, and marmosets as these are common animal models, but there is much that remains unknown regarding reproduction in many other primates. Examining the similarities and differences between and within taxonomic groups allows reasonable extrapolation for decision-making when there are knowledge gaps. For example: (1) knowing that a species has very low reproductive rates adds urgency to conservation policy for that region or species; (2) identifying species with short or absent lactation anestrus allows ex situ institutions to better plan contraception options for specific individuals or prepare for the immediate next pregnancy; (3) recognizing that progestin contraceptives are effective contraceptives, but may be associated with endometrial hyperplasia in some species (in Lemuridae but not great apes) better guides empirical contraceptive choice; (4) recognizing the variable endometriosis prevalence across taxa improves preventive medicine programs. A summary of anatomical variation, endocrinology, contraception, pathology, and diagnostics is provided to illustrate these features and aid in routine physical and postmortem examinations as well as primate management.",

Using linked employer-employee administrative panel data from Hungary, we analyze the dynamics of healthcare use before and after moving to a new firm. We show that moving to a higher-paying firm leads to higher consumption of drugs for cardiovascular conditions and more diagnostic and primary care visits, without evidence of deteriorating physical health, and, among men and older workers, to lower consumption of medications for mental health conditions. The results are robust to using alternative firm quality indicators based on productivity and worker flows, and to controlling for firm size, individual wage, and possible peer effects. The results suggest that higher-paying firms provide beneficial health-related amenities via the detection of previously undiagnosed chronic physical illnesses and improved mental health. Plausible mechanisms include higher-quality occupational health check-ups and less stressful working conditions.",

      "abstract": "The National Institutes of Health have recently gathered internal and external input towards a shared understanding of resilience in the wide context of human health and the biomedical sciences that would help accelerate advances in human health and its maintenance. We suggest the current view that resilience refers in general to a system's capacity to recover, grow, adapt, or resist perturbation from a challenge or stressor. To help harmonize the design and reporting of resilience research studies across multiple domains we have developed and are proposing a Resilience Research Design (ResD) Tool. Researchers can use the Resilience ResD Tool to proceed through a flowchart of six questions that will guide identification of key features in a resilience research study. Through this special supplement, we have shown the application of the Resilience ResD Tool and suggest opportunities and gaps with respect to next steps towards operationalizing resilience research.",

      "abstract": "Historians have clearly articulated the ways in which sleeplessness has long been part of the human condition. As an object of medical expertise and public health intervention, however, insomnia is a much more recent invention, having gained its status as a pathology during the 1870s. But while insomnia has attracted considerable and concerted attention from public health authorities allied with sleep medicine specialists, this phenomenon is not well explained by classical medicalization theory, in part because it is the sleepless sufferers, not the medical experts, who typically have the authority to diagnose insomnia. The dynamics of insomnia's history are better described as those of a boundary object, around which concepts and practices of biomedicine and psychology coalesce to frame contemporary notions of self-medicalization and self-experiment.",

      "abstract": "The current review aimed to explore the association between urban greenspaces and health indicators. In particular, our aims were to analyze the association between publicly accessible urban greenspaces exposure and two selected health outcomes (objectively measured physical activity (PA) and mental health outcomes (MH)). Two electronic databases-PubMed/Medline and Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE)-were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2020. Only articles in English were considered. Out of 356 retrieved articles, a total of 34 papers were included in our review. Of those, 15 assessed the association between urban greenspace and PA and 19 dealt with MH. Almost all the included studies found a positive association between urban greenspace and both PA and MH, while a few demonstrated a non-effect or a negative effect on MH outcomes. However, only guaranteeing access is not enough. Indeed, important elements are maintenance, renovation, closeness to residential areas, planning of interactive activities, and perceived security aspects. Overall, despite some methodological limitations of the included studies, the results have shown almost univocally that urban greenspaces harbour potentially beneficial effects on physical and mental health and well-being.",

A systematic literature review of occupational RF EMF exposure measurements could help to clarify where more attention to occupational safety may be needed. This review identifies specific sources of occupational RF EMF exposure and compares the published maximum exposures to occupational exposure limits. A systematic search for peer-reviewed publications was conducted via PubMed and Scopus. Relevant grey literature was collected via web searches. For each publication, the highest measured electric field strength, magnetic flux density or power density was extracted. Maximum exposures exceeding the limits were reported for dielectric heating, scanners for security and radiofrequency identification, plasma devices and broadcasting and telecommunication transmitters. Occupational exposure exceeding the limits was rare for microwave heating and radar applications. Some publications concerned cases studies of occupational accidents followed by a medical investigation of thermal health effects. These were found for broadcasting antennas, radar installations and a microwave oven and often involved maintenance personnel. New sources of occupational exposure such as those in fifth generation telecommunication systems or energy transition will require further assessment.",

      "abstract": "The widely documented beneficial effects of children's experiences with nature make it plausible to assume that an environment close to nature also has a positive effect on health in childhood, that is, that it can also contribute to health maintenance and prevention. The findings on health-promoting effects of nature are remarkable and are accentuated and theoretically substantiated here with a focus on mental health.The basis is a so-called three-dimensional personality model, according to which mental development is not only a function of the subject's relationship to other people, but also to the world of things, including nature. In addition, three explanatory approaches for the health effects of nature experiences are outlined: (1) the anthropologically based \"Stress Recovery Theory,\" (2) the \"Attention Restoration Theory,\" and (3) the assumption that nature as a symbolic storehouse for self- and world interpretations can accompany the meaning constitution of the subjects (\"Therapeutic Landscapes\").The health effects of accessible open spaces close to nature are discussed, whereby the state of research for adults is much richer than for children. With regard to mental health or its influencing variables, the following dimensions are elaborated with empirical results: stress reduction, antidepressant and mood enhancing effects, prosocial behavior, attention and ADHD, cognitive development, self-esteem and self-regulation, nature experience, and exercise. From a salutogenetic perspective, nature does not have a deterministic effect on health, but rather, in a sense, an incidental effect when open spaces close to nature are accessible and used. This casualness of the effect of nature experiences has to be considered in possible therapeutic or educational interventions.",

      "abstract": "A \"Pandemic/Disaster Law\" is needed to condense and organize the current dispersed and multiple legislation. The State must exercise a single power and command appropriate to each situation, with national validity. The production of plans for the use of land and real estate as potential centers for health care, shelter or refuge is recommended. There should be specific disaster plans at least for Primary Health Care, Hospitals and Socio-sanitary Centers. The guarantee of the maintenance of communication and supply routes is essential, as well as the guarantee of the autochthonous production of basic goods. The pandemic has highlighted the need to redefine the training plans for physicians who, in their different specialties, have to undertake reforms that allow a more versatile and transversal training. National research must have plans to be able to respond quickly to questions posed by the various crises, using all the nation's resources and in particular, all the data and capabilities of the health sector. Contingency plans must consider ethical aspects, and meet the needs of patients and families with a humanized approach. In circumstances of catastrophe, conflicts increase and require a bioethical response that allows the best decisions to be made, with the utmost respect for people's values. Rapid, efficient and truthful communication systems must be contained in a special project for this sector in critic circumstances. Finally, we believe that the creation of National Coordination Centers for major disasters and Public Health can contribute to better face the crises of the future.",

      "abstract": "The advent of electric micro-mobility (EMM) has transformed the urban mobility landscape, with projections indicating a 5-10% increase in its modal share in European cities by 2030. In this scoping review, we aimed to comprehensively examine the key determinants of EMM adoption and usage from a public health perspective. Sixty-seven articles were included in the analysis, primarily covering e-bikes and e-scooters. The determinants were categorised into two broad categories: (1) contextual determinants that encompass enabling and hindering factors related to legal frameworks, transportation systems and infrastructure, and technology, and (2) individual-level determinants that pertain to intrinsic motivations and deterrents of individuals. Our findings reveal that EMM vehicles are widely perceived as a cost-effective, flexible, ad hoc, and fast mode of transportation within urban areas, augmenting accessibility and connectivity. Additionally, the lightweight, foldable, and transportable nature of these vehicles is highly appreciated by users. However, several barriers have also been identified, including inadequate infrastructure and end-of-trip facilities, limited capability to traverse diverse terrains and trip scenarios, acquisition and maintenance costs, limited carrying capacities, technical failures, and accident risks. Our results suggest that the interplay of contextual enablers and barriers and personal motivations and deterrents drive the emergence, adoption, and usage of EMM. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of both contextual and individual-level determinants is crucial for ensuring a sustainable and healthy uptake of EMM.",

      "abstract": "The Covid-19 epidemic is an opportunity to underline how prison health on the African continent remains a weak link of the prison system. Beyond the difficulties in caring for Covid-19 in detention, prison infirmaries, where they exist, are rarely integrated into the health system in practice. Administrations provide little for the vital needs of prisoners. Dietary deficiencies are frequent, skin diseases recurrent and prisoners are most often dependent on the financial means of their families or NGOs when it comes to access to health care. The social illegitimacy of the prison population and the reluctance of States to offer convicted prisoners what they do not guarantee to the general population are two arguments put forward to justify what amounts to necropolitics. At the same time, international actors working in prisons essentially target pathologies with epidemic potential, constrained by funding sources (UNAIDS, Global Fund) supporting population-wide health strategies. Here we would like to return to these two logics and develop an argument for a decompartmentalized approach to prison health. Beyond the recognition of individual health experience and epidemiological concerns, addressing prison health globally contributes to the restoration of prisoners' dignity and rights by the State, a necessary condition for the maintenance of citizenship beyond confinement.",

      "abstract": "People diagnosed with mental illness (hereon referred to as consumers) experience a disproportionately lower life expectancy of up 30 years compared to the general population. Systemic issues such as diagnostic overshadowing and stigma from healthcare professionals have inhibited the development of positive therapeutic partnerships that enable consumers to seek and engage support for their physical health concerns. Consumers have called for healthcare professionals to skillfully develop and prioritize therapeutic partnerships whilst coordinating and providing physical healthcare. The aim of this qualitative descriptive research was to explore consumer views and experiences of their interactions with a specialist mental health nursing role, the Physical Health Nurse Consultant. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 consumers from a large public Community Mental Health Service in the Australian Capital Territory. Interviews were transcribed and thematically analysed. Therapeutic partnerships were an overarching theme identified from the data and included three sub-themes: personal attributes of the Physical Health Nurse Consultant; behaviour change engagement strategies; and impact of the therapeutic partnership. Consumers described the personal and professional attributes of the Physical Health Nurse Consultant that enabled the establishment and maintenance of their highly valued therapeutic partnership. This therapeutic partnership was perceived to positively impact their personal and clinical outcomes. With increasing support from consumers, clinical practice settings should move towards embedding a Physical Health Nurse Consultant role in routine practice. Further research exploring the co-development of health behaviour change goals and, barriers and facilitators experienced by the consumers regarding the Physical Health Nurse Consultant is required to further role development.",

      "abstract": "This paper argues that diverse disciplines within the human sciences have converged in identifying the conditions that human beings need to thrive and the programs, policies, and practices that are needed to foster well-being. In the interest of promoting this view, we suggest that this convergence might usefully be labeled \"The Nurture Consilience.\" We review evidence from evolutionary biology, developmental, clinical, and social psychology, as well as public health and prevention science indicating that, for evolutionary reasons, coercive environments promote a \"fast\" life strategy that favors limited self-regulation, immediate gratification, and early childbearing. However, this trajectory can be prevented through programs, practices, and policies that (a) minimize toxic social and biological conditions, (b) limit opportunities and influences for problem behavior, (c) richly reinforce prosocial behavior, and (d) promote psychological flexibility. The recognition of these facts has prompted research on the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of evidence-based interventions. To fully realize the fruits of this consilience, it is necessary to reform every sector of society. We review evidence that free-market advocacy has promoted the view that if individuals simply pursue their own economic well-being it will benefit everyone, and trace how that view led business, health care, education, criminal justice, and government to adopt practices that have benefited a small segment of the population but harmed the majority. We argue that the first step in reforming each sector of society would be to promote the value of ensuring everyone's well-being. The second step will be to create contingencies that select beneficial practices and minimizes harmful ones.",

This qualitative systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence related to facilitators and challenges that affect the ability of global Indigenous communities to maintain oral health. Two independent reviewers searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Embase. Qualitative studies including illustrations from Indigenous Peoples regarding facilitators and challenges to oral health maintenance were considered. Included articles were critically appraised. The search identified 4,247 articles eligible for inclusion; 22 articles were included. Challenges and facilitators were synthesised across child, carer, community, and service levels during the meta-aggregation. The prioritisation of integrated oral health services, programs, and research that encompass multiple factors at various levels of influence are needed to strengthen the oral health of Indigenous communities.",

      "abstract": "The majority of Americans make their sexual debut during their adolescent years. Preventing pregnancy and STI during this period is vital to ensuring health and safety. As survival has improved after pediatric SOT, chronically immunosuppressed adolescents seek guidance in their medical home on matters of sexual health. Transplant practitioners often do not feel equipped to fully address these needs. This review serves as an introductory sexual preventive care resource for adolescent and young adult (AYA) SOT recipients. First, we review data on safety, efficacy, and use of contraceptive options currently available for transplant recipients with child-bearing potential. Then, we suggest a personalized sexual health discussion focusing on the diagnosis and prevention of STIs in adolescent and young adult transplant recipients. Finally, we present recommendations for STI screening of asymptomatic patients, use of index of suspicion and diagnostic testing in symptomatic patients, and opportunities to optimize STI prevention strategies. Data compiled from studies of adult SOT recipients, general population studies, and published guidelines are often extrapolated for use, as limited data exist in AYA SOT recipients. This informational dearth underscores the need for future research to better characterize the unique needs of AYA SOT recipients.",

      "title": "Understanding the physical examination of the shoulder: a narrative review.",
      "abstract": "The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint which provides an extensive range of motion. Shoulder pain and weakness are common complaints among patients, which can lead to disability and affect a person's ability to perform daily activities. Shoulder pain and weakness may be associated with shoulder conditions such as rotator cuff disorders adhesive capsulitis, superior labrum anterior to posterior lesions, lesions in the biceps, acromioclavicular joint disease, or instability. Often, a thorough understanding of the network of bony, ligamentous, muscular, and neurovascular anatomy is required to properly identify and diagnose shoulder pathology. Identifying a specific shoulder pathology may be challenging, considering the numerous structures involved in shoulder function. Appropriate physical examination of the shoulder is important for making an accurate diagnosis and distinguishing certain pathologies of the shoulder. Evaluation of shoulder problem may be reliant upon physical examination, which involves inspection, palpation, assessment of range of motion, strength, and neurovascular integrity. In addition, specific tests are used to reproduce symptoms and signs that would help physicians identify the pathology of the shoulder problem. The aim of this study was to review the shoulder anatomy and describe the specific tests used to evaluate common shoulder conditions to facilitate accurate diagnosis and guide proper treatment of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining physical performance: the minimal dose of exercise needed to preserve endurance and strength over time, Spiering, BA, Mujika, I, Sharp, MA, and Foulis, SA. J Strength Cond Res 35(5): 1449-1458, 2021-Nearly every physically active person encounters periods in which the time available for exercise is limited (e.g., personal, family, or business conflicts). During such periods, the goal of physical training may be to simply maintain (rather than improve) physical performance. Similarly, certain special populations may desire to maintain performance for prolonged periods, namely athletes (during the competitive season and off-season) and military personnel (during deployment). The primary purpose of this brief, narrative review is to identify the minimal dose of exercise (i.e., frequency, volume, and intensity) needed to maintain physical performance over time. In general populations, endurance performance can be maintained for up to 15 weeks when training frequency is reduced to as little as 2 sessions per week or when exercise volume is reduced by 33-66% (as low as 13-26 minutes per session), as long as exercise intensity (exercising heart rate) is maintained. Strength and muscle size (at least in younger populations) can be maintained for up to 32 weeks with as little as 1 session of strength training per week and 1 set per exercise, as long as exercise intensity (relative load) is maintained; whereas, in older populations, maintaining muscle size may require up to 2 sessions per week and 2-3 sets per exercise, while maintaining exercise intensity. Insufficient data exists to make specific recommendations for athletes or military personnel. Our primary conclusion is that exercise intensity seems to be the key variable for maintaining physical performance over time, despite relatively large reductions in exercise frequency and volume.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets have emerged as athletic performance enhancers for various types of exercise. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effectiveness of plant-based diets on aerobic and strength/power performances, as well as on BMI of physically active individuals. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. A systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus, was performed. On the basis of the search and inclusion criteria, four and six studies evaluating the effects of plant-based diets on aerobic and strength/power performances in humans were, respectively, included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Plant-based diets had a moderate but positive effect on aerobic performance (0·55; 95 % CI 0·29, 0·81) and no effect on strength/power performance (-0·30; 95 % CI -0·67, 0·07). The altogether analyses of both aerobic and strength/power exercises revealed that athletic performance was unchanged (0·01; 95 % CI -0·21, 0·22) in athletes who adopted plant-based diets. However, a small negative effect on BMI (-0·27; 95 % CI -0·40, -0·15) was induced by these diets. The results indicate that plant-based diets have the potential to exclusively assist aerobic performance. On the other hand, these diets do not jeopardise strength/power performance. Overall, the predicted effects of plant-based diets on physical performance are impactless, even though the BMI of their adherents is reduced.",

Periodization and block periodization in sports: emphasis on strength-power training-a provocative and challenging narrative. J Strength Cond Res 35(8): 2351-2371, 2021-Periodization can be defined as a logical sequential, phasic method of manipulating fitness and recovery phases to increase the potential for achieving specific performance goals while minimizing the potential for nonfunctional over-reaching, overtraining, and injury. Periodization deals with the micromanagement of timelines and fitness phases and is cyclic in nature. On the other hand, programming deals with the micromanagement of the training process and deals with exercise selection, volume, intensity, etc. Evidence indicates that a periodized training process coupled with appropriate programming can produce superior athletic enhancement compared with nonperiodized process. There are 2 models of periodization, traditional and block. Traditional can take different forms (i.e., reverse). Block periodization has 2 subtypes, single goal or factor (individual sports) and multiple goals or factors (team sports). Both models have strengths and weaknesses but can be \"tailored\" through creative programming to produce excellent results for specific sports.",

      "abstract": "Periscapular pain and dysfunction are relatively common complaints in the practice of upper extremity surgeons. However, evaluation of the dysfunctional scapula is intimidating for most. Physical examination of the periscapular muscles is very rich, and a systematic approach provides the opportunity to establish a diagnosis for most patients. Conditions underlying scapular dysfunction include trapezius palsy, serratus palsy, brachial plexus injuries, muscular dystrophy, snapping scapula, pectoralis minor syndrome, congenital undescended scapula, and functional scapular dyskinesis, among others. Patients should be examined with their torso uncovered and assessed from the front and back. Inspection, evaluation of motion, and strength testing may be followed by certain examination maneuvers specific for each condition. The scapular assistance test may help predict the outcome of treatment for certain conditions. Plain radiographs oftentimes need to be complemented with magnetic resonance of the chest to capture periscapular muscles as well as an electromyogram with nerve conduction studies. Computed tomography is particularly helpful for skeletal abnormalities. Ultrasound is used to assess certain peripheral nerve injuries and to guide diagnostic and therapeutic injections. A focused evaluation of the scapula followed by a more specific and directed approach for each condition suspected will allow upper extremity surgeons to approach the evaluation of the dysfunctional scapula with much more confidence.",

Participants were 3441 men and women aged 18-85 years who filled in a questionnaire and participated in a clinical health examination in the Danish Health Examination Survey 2007-2008. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated by an indirect maximal exercise test. Muscle strength was measured by (a) sit-to-stand test, (b) handgrip strength, and (c) bent arm strength. Body mass index and fat percentage were used as measures for body composition. Associations were derived from regression analyses, correlations were calculated using Spearman's correlation test, and agreement was tested by kappa statistics. Within categories of self-rated physical fitness moving from lowest to highest, objectively measured cardiorespiratory fitness increased. Self-rated physical fitness was strongly correlated to cardiorespiratory fitness (r",

      "abstract": "Physically demanding essential military tasks include load carriage, manual material handling and casualty evacuation. This narrative review characterizes the main physical attributes related to performance of these occupational tasks and reviews physical training intervention studies in military settings to improve performance in these military tasks. Load carriage performance requires both aerobic and neuromuscular fitness with greater emphasis on maximal strength and absolute maximal oxygen uptake, especially when carrying heavier loads. In manual material handling, maximal strength and power are strongly associated with discrete lifting, while muscular strength, muscular endurance and aerobic fitness are also associated with repetitive lifting performance. Maximal strength including grip strength, muscular endurance, absolute maximal oxygen uptake and anaerobic capacity are associated with casualty evacuation performance. The results of the present review particularly emphasize the role of muscular fitness in successful performance of the reviewed military occupational tasks. Training intervention studies indicate that load carriage performance can be effectively improved by combining strength, aerobic and specific load carriage training. Improvement in maximal lifting capacity can be achieved by strength training or combined strength and aerobic training, while strength and aerobic training alone, or their combination are effective in improving repetitive lifting, and carry tasks. Only a few studies are available for casualty evacuation and the results are inconclusive but may indicate benefits of strength or combined training. Moreover, emphasis on lower volume but higher intensity in combined training may be a feasible and effective mode to improve military occupational performance in recruits and active-duty soldiers.",

      "abstract": "Periostin, involved in extracellular matrix development and support, has been shown to be elevated in senescent tissues and fibrotic states, transversal signatures of aging. We aimed to explore associations between plasma periostin and physical and cognitive capacity evolution among older adults. Our hypothesis was that higher levels of plasma periostin will be associated with worse physical and mental capacities along time. Analyses included 1 096 participants (mean age = 75.3 years ± 4.4; 63.9% women) from the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial. Periostin levels (pg/mL) were measured in plasma collected at year 1. Periostin was used in continuous variable, and as a dichotomous variable highest quartile (POSTN+) versus lowest 3 quartiles (POSTN-) were used. Outcomes were measured annually over 4 years and included: gait speed (GS), short physical performance battery (SPPB) score, 5-times sit-to-stand test (5-STS), and handgrip strength (HS) as physical and cognitive composite z-score (CCS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as cognitive endpoints. Plasma periostin as a continuous variable was associated with the worsening of physical and cognitive capacities over 4 years of follow-up, specifically the SPPB score, the 5-STS, and CCS in full-adjusted models. POSTN+ was associated with worse evolution in the physical (GS: [β = -0.057, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.101, -0.013], SPPB score [β = -0.736, 95% CI = -1.091, -0.381], 5-STS [β = 1.681, 95% CI = 0.801, 2.561]) as well as cognitive (CCS [β = -0.215, 95% CI = -0.335, -0.094]) domains compared to POSTN- group. No association was found with HS or the MMSE score. Our study showed for the first time that increased plasma periostin levels were associated with declines in both physical and cognitive capacities in older adults over a 4-year follow-up. Further research is needed to evaluate whether periostin might be used as a predictive biomarker of functional decline at an older age.",

J Strength Cond Res 36(12): 3562-3570, 2022-This systematic review examines the effect of dietary nitrate supplementation (SUP) on muscle strength and hypertrophy when combined with physical exercise. The databases PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE were searched for full-text articles published between January 2000 and June 2020. For inclusion, studies had to report on the effects of SUP administered as acute or chronic doses together with a standardized exercise protocol on muscle strength and hypertrophy compared with placebo in healthy adults who were sedentary, physically active, or professional athletes. Twelve studies (1,571 subjects) were finally selected. In 5 studies, the SUP regime was acute, and in 7, it was chronic. SUP was nitrate-rich beetroot juice in 9 studies, a potassium nitrate capsule in 1, and increased dietary nitrate in 2. Ingested nitrate was 64-1,200 mg. Of the 12 studies, 6 observed an ergogenic effect of SUP compared with placebo. These findings indicate that muscle strength gains are possible provided the dose, format, frequency, period, and exercise test are appropriate. Best results were observed with a minimum acute dose of 400 mg of nitrate provided as beetroot juice/shot taken 2-2.5 hours before exercise involving low- and high-intensity muscle contractions. This SUP regime seems to improve muscle efficiency in terms of reduced phosphocreatine and energy costs (P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy) and improved time to exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this umbrella review was to provide a detailed summary of how flywheel training enhances strength and physical capacities in healthy and athletic populations. The eleven reviews included were analyzed for methodological quality according to the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Review 2 (AMSTAR 2) and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. Two were systematic reviews, six were systematic reviews with meta-analyses and three were narrative reviews. Although the included reviews support use of flywheel training with athletic and healthy populations, the umbrella review highlights disparity in methodological quality and over-reporting of studies (38 studies were included overall). Flywheel post-activation performance enhancement protocols can effectively enhance strength and physical capacities acutely with athletes and healthy populations. All relevant reviews support flywheel training as a valid alternative to traditional resistance training for enhancing muscular strength, power, and jump performance with untrained and trained populations alike. Similarly, reviews included report flywheel training enhances change of direction performance-although conclusions are based on a limited number of investigations. However, the reviews investigating the effect of flywheel training on sprint performance highlight some inconsistency in attained improvements with elite athletes (e.g., soccer players). To optimize training outcomes, it is recommended practitioners individualize (i.e., create inertia-power or inertia-velocity profiles) and periodize flywheel training using the latest guidelines. This umbrella review provides an analysis of the literature's strengths and limitations, creating a clear scope for future investigations.",

      "abstract": "Wing, C, Hart, NH, Ma'ayah, F, and Nosaka, K. Factors affecting physical and technical performance in Australian football. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1844-1851, 2023-This study assessed player (i.e., lower-body strength and power and aerobic fitness) and environmental (e.g., venue) factors and their effects on the physical (e.g., distance) and technical (e.g., kicks) demands of Australian football (AF). Relative distance, high-speed running (HSR), and acceleration efforts for 19 matches by 33 players in a West AF League team were analyzed from global positioning system data split into periods of successful offense and defense and maximum ball in play (BiP) periods, as well as technical actions. Lower-body strength and power, and aerobic fitness were evaluated using a one-repetition trap-bar deadlift, countermovement jump, 2-km time trial, and Yo-Yo intermittent fitness test, respectively. In matches played at home, distance (p < 0.001, ES = 0.39) and HSR (p < 0.001, ES = 0.34) were significantly reduced during successful defense. In addition, tackle rate was significantly increased (p = 0.003, ES = 0.16) during successful defense when playing at home. Trap-bar deadlift relative to mass significantly increased relative distance (p = 0.004, ES = 0.51) and HSR (p = 0.029, ES = 0.40) in successful offense. In successful defense, superior time trial performance significantly increased relative distance (p < 0.001, ES = 0.58), HSR (p < 0.001, ES = 0.59), and acceleration efforts (p = 0.017, ES = 0.44), while relative distance (p < 0.001, ES = 0.62) and HSR (p = 0.004, ES = 0.52) were also increased during maximum BiP periods. The results demonstrate that player factors have the largest effect on the physical and technical performance of AF players.",

J Strength Cond Res 37(5): 1157-1161, 2023-The 75th Ranger Regiment (75RR) is an elite airborne infantry unit that is prepared to deploy on short notice and is resourced to maintain exceptional proficiency and readiness through prolonged deployments. Soldiers must be airborne qualified and pass a number of physical and psychological tests during training to become a member of 75RR. Rangers must maintain a level of physical performance comparable to high-level athletes while also handling operational stressors that include a negative-energy balance, high-energy expenditure, sleep restriction, and completing missions in extreme environments, all of which increase their chance of illness or infection. There are also situations of heighted injury risk, such as parachuting and repelling, which are routinely required in combat operations. Thus far, only one screening tool to assess injury risk has been developed. There are also physical training programs to enhance performance for Rangers in 75RR. This narrative review aims to evaluate the body of literature surrounding performance and health-related research in US Army Rangers to understand how Rangers are impacted during training or operations, to inform future training recommendations, and to identify areas of future research that are warranted and could potentially optimize the health and performance of Rangers during future training or operation events.",

It affects approximately 13% of the world's population aged over 60 years. Sarcopenia is primarily managed and prevented through a combination of exercise prescription combined with appropriate nutritional strategies. This review outlines diagnostic and case finding/screening tools for age-related (primary) sarcopenia used in research and clinical practice. Diagnostic tools critically reviewed include those of the: European Workgroup for Sarcopenia (EWGSOP) versions 1 and 2; Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) versions 1 and 2; Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH); and the Sarcopenia Definition and Outcomes Consortium (SDOC). Criteria used by diagnostic tools (muscle mass, muscle strength and physical functioning/performance) are also detailed. Case-finding tools include the SARC-F questionnaire, Ishii's formula and Goodman's screening grid. Additionally, this review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each diagnostic and case-finding tool, and examines their ability to reliably predict adverse clinical outcomes and patient responses to potential therapies.",

Virtual visits rely on history-taking and patient self-reported descriptions of pain elicited from self-palpation or specific movements while on the telephone with the clinician. Video examinations provide a unique way of evaluating the lower back compared to telephone because of the ability to visualize the actions of the patient.",

J Strength Cond Res 35(11): 3270-3279, 2021-This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to summarize evidence on performance differences between Greco-Roman (GR) and freestyle (Fr) wrestlers. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (91 individual data and a total of 752 wrestlers). The analysis of handgrip strength comprised 9 outcomes from 5 studies with no significant difference between GR and Fr wrestlers. The analysis of isometric (back or leg) strength comprised 15 outcomes from 6 studies with a significant effect favoring GR wrestlers. The analysis of muscle power comprised 15 outcomes from 5 studies with a significant effect favoring GR wrestlers. The analysis of strength endurance comprised 4 outcomes from 3 studies with no significant difference between GR and Fr wrestlers. The analysis of anaerobic capacity and power comprised 6 outcomes from 3 studies with no significant difference between GR and Fr wrestlers. The analysis of speed comprised 19 outcomes from 7 studies with a significant effect favoring GR wrestlers. The analysis of flexibility comprised 20 outcomes from 6 studies with a significant effect favoring Fr wrestlers. This study indicated that GR wrestlers had greater isometric strength, muscle power, and speed performance, but Fr wrestlers had greater flexibility. Given the significant effect sizes favoring GR wrestlers, it is possible that they focused on training strategies to improve physical strength-power performance. However, considering the significant effect size favoring Fr wrestlers, it is possible that they focused on training strategies to improve flexibility because Fr wrestling techniques require a larger range of motion during both attack and defense.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease, generating pain, disability, and socioeconomic costs worldwide. Currently there are no approved disease-modifying drugs for OA, and safety concerns have been identified with the chronic use of symptomatic drugs. In this context, nutritional supplements and nutraceuticals have emerged as potential alternatives. Among them, collagen is being a focus of particular interest, but under the same term different types of collagens coexist with different structures, compositions, and origins, leading to different properties and potential effects. The aim of this narrative review is to generally describe the main types of collagens currently available in marketplace, focusing on those related to joint health, describing their mechanism of action, preclinical, and clinical evidence. Native and hydrolyzed collagen are the most studied collagen types for joint health. Native collagen has a specific immune-mediated mechanism that requires the recognition of its epitopes to inhibit inflammation and tissue catabolism at articular level. Hydrolyzed collagen may contain biologically active peptides that are able to reach joint tissues and exert chondroprotective effects. Although there are preclinical and clinical studies showing the safety and efficacy of food ingredients containing both types of collagens, available research suggests a clear link between collagen chemical structure and mechanism of action.",

      "title": "Female Fertility and the Nutritional Approach: The Most Essential Aspects.",
      "abstract": "Infertility is an increasing problem that affects couples attempting pregnancy. A growing body of evidence points to a link between diet and female fertility. In fact, data show that a diet high in trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and added sugars can negatively affect fertility. Conversely, a diet based on the Mediterranean dietary patterns, i.e., rich in dietary fiber, omega-3 (ɷ-3) fatty acids, plant-based protein, and vitamins and minerals, has a positive impact on female fertility. An unhealthy diet can disrupt microbiota composition, and it is worth investigating whether the composition of the gut microbiota correlates with the frequency of infertility. There is a lack of evidence to exclude gluten from the diet of every woman trying to become pregnant in the absence of celiac disease. Furthermore, there are no data concerning adverse effects of alcohol on female fertility, and caffeine consumption in the recommended amounts also does not seem to affect fertility. On the other hand, phytoestrogens presumably have a positive influence on female fertility. Nevertheless, there are many unanswered questions with regard to supplementation in order to enhance fertility. It has been established that women of childbearing age should supplement folic acid. Moreover, most people experience vitamin D and iodine deficiency; thus, it is vital to control their blood concentrations and consider supplementation if necessary. Therefore, since diet and lifestyle seem to be significant factors influencing fertility, it is valid to expand knowledge in this area.",

There are numerous products on the market, many with thousands of reviews (both positive and negative). Nutritional supplements are regulated by the FDA as foods instead of drugs, meaning they do not have to prove their efficacy and safety before becoming available to consumers. While some oral supplements have strong evidence supporting their use for hair growth, many ingredients have not been tested in clinical trials, have only in vitro evidence for hair growth, or have only been tested in animals. Given these industry characteristics, it is important for dermatologists to be aware of the safety and utility of these ingredients to provide appropriate counseling to their patients. The goal of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of popular hair growth oral supplement ingredients and formulations. This review does not address the topical formulations of these ingredients and their effects on hair growth.",

      "abstract": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "Objective: to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effects of high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplementation on physical, mental, and energy outcomes in healthy and 'at-risk' (suboptimal nutritional status/subclinical symptoms at baseline) adult populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for relevant randomized controlled trials until January 2020. Results: overall, 136 publications were identified. In the seven randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies considered eligible for inclusion, supplementation in healthy populations predominantly showed improvements in perceived stress, physical stamina, concentration, and general mental health, and significant reductions in anxiety and improvements in self-reported vigour. However, not all of these outcomes were significant, and statistical correction for multiple outcomes was not commonly employed. Studies investigating brain mapping following supplementation indicated increased functional activity in brain regions related to processing of attention, executive control, and working memory during cognitive tasks. Conclusions: while there is certainly a need for further studies on the neurocognitive and physical benefits of micronutrient supplementation, this review provides generally supportive evidence for the benefits of a high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplement in healthy and at-risk populations in terms of physical, mental, and energy outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Lenzi, JL, Teixeira, EL, de Jesus, G, Schoenfeld, BJ, and de Salles Painelli, V. Dietary strategies of modern bodybuilders during different phases of the competitive cycle. J Strength Cond Res 35(9): 2546-2551, 2021-Bodybuilders have used a wide array of nutritional strategies over the years. However, most information on the topic is anecdotal, with limited research about the nutritional habits of modern bodybuilders, especially those from new categories. Accordingly, we sought to compare the dietary routines of bodybuilders from the Men's Physique category during \"bulking\" and \"cutting\" phases, while attempting to identify the rationale underpinning these practices. Sixteen experienced male bodybuilding competitors were interviewed during bulking (10-12 weeks before competition) and cutting (1 week before competition) phases, wherein we quantified energy and nutrient intake and determined their rationale and sources of education. Dietary analysis revealed a low carbohydrate intake during bulking, with a further decrease (at p < 0.05) during cutting. A similar decrease (at p < 0.05) from bulking to cutting was shown in the intake of most macronutrients and micronutrients, although intake of protein and almost all the micronutrients was well above the recommendation throughout the competitive cycle. Most of the consumed supplements can be deemed unnecessary or without scientific support. Most athletes reported self-managing their diet and supplement program, without the assistance of nutrition professionals. As such, some of their professed nutritional habits obtained during interviewers were not consistent with the food diary information. Although some dietary strategies used by bodybuilders in the Men's Physique category are consistent with evidence-based practice, most can be considered extreme and lack scientific support. The source of education may help to explain their decision-making.",

      "title": "Analytical Review on Nutritional Deficiencies in Vegan Diets: Risks, Prevention, and Optimal Strategies.",
      "abstract": "Factors like health concerns, environmental issues, and ethics have driven the rapid rise in veganism's popularity over the last decade. While studies confirm that veganism reduces the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, significant challenges persist in meeting nutritional needs. This review identifies critical dietary deficiencies common in vegan diets, including inadequacies in vitamin B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, Iodine, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, and explores strategies to mitigate these risks. These deficiencies result in chronic diseases like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. Hence, this review observes the clinical literature to establish causes and will discuss a supplement strategy to enhance these deficiencies. Economic accessibility to fortified foods and supplements poses additional challenges, particularly for low-income individuals or regions with limited access to vegan-friendly products. Addressing these barriers is essential to make vegan diets viable for all. Many of these nutrients, predominantly found in animal products, are difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts through plant-based diets alone, leading to potential health risks like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. This study evaluates clinical literature to pinpoint the causes of these deficiencies and examines effective supplementation strategies to address them. Beyond highlighting the challenges, it discusses the environmental benefits of veganism, showing how plant-based diets significantly reduce water usage, land pressure, and greenhouse gas emissions. The study concludes that while a poorly planned vegan diet can lead to nutritional inadequacies, with proper dietary planning and personalized supplementation, vegan diets can support long-term health and promote environmental sustainability. Recommendations from experts are also included for tailoring vegan diets to meet individual health needs effectively.",

      "abstract": "The human body, particularly the brain, requires energy, stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Energy metabolism during cellular respiration is dependent on the presence of multiple micronutrients, which act as essential components, coenzymes, or precursors at every stage. An adequate supply of multiple micronutrients is vital for efficient energy production. However, micronutrient intakes below the recommended dietary allowance are common, even in industrialized countries. Intakes of vitamins A, D, E, folate, iron, zinc, and selenium are suboptimal across all age groups. Suboptimal micronutrient levels have been shown to contribute to low energy levels, physical and mental fatigue, and impaired cognitive performance and wellbeing - symptoms frequently present in the general population. When supplemented in combination in well-conducted trials, multiple micronutrients ± coenzyme Q10 reduced oxidative stress in chronic fatigue syndrome; in healthy people they increased cerebral blood-flow hemodynamic response, energy expenditure, and fat oxidation; reduced mental and physical fatigue; improved the speed and accuracy of cognitive function during demanding tasks; and reduced stress. The results from these clinical trials suggest that even in industrialized countries, where adults might be assumed to have a healthy, balanced diet, there is a rationale to supplement with multiple micronutrients, including coenzyme Q10, to improve nutritional status, support energy metabolism, and improve subjective wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Dietary supplements are products containing nutrients sold in various medicinal forms, and their widespread use may stem from the conviction that a preparation that looks like a drug must have therapeutic properties. The aim of this scoping review is to present what is known about the effects of using selected dietary supplements in the context of chronic diseases, as well as the risks associated with their use. The literature shows that the taking of vitamin and mineral supplements by healthy people neither lowers their risk of cardiovascular diseases nor prevents the development of malignancies. Many scientific societies recognize that omega-3 fatty acids lower blood triglycerides, but whether taking them prevents heart disease is less clear-cut. Taking weight loss supplements is not an effective method of fighting obesity. Often, some supplements are increasingly sold illegally, which is then also associated with the higher risk that they may be adulterated with banned substances, thus making them even more dangerous and potentially life-threatening. Supplements are necessary in cases of nutrient deficiency; however, even though prescription is not required, their use should be recommended and monitored by a physician.",

      "abstract": "Lymphedema is a chronic inflammatory disorder resulting from ineffective fluid uptake by the lymphatic system, and the effects are principally felt in the lower limbs. The condition is said to be primary when caused by genetic mutations and secondary when caused by injuries, infections, or surgery. Lymphedema, a worldwide pathology, does not have an effective therapy so far. Leukotriene B4 has recently been identified as a key molecule in lymphedema pathogenesis. Surgical, nonsurgical, and pharmacological treatments have been proposed; however, they do not cure the disease and only ameliorate the symptoms. Nutrition and nutritional status are extremely important in lymphedema physiopathology. Obesity is a comorbidity that exacerbates the risk for secondary lymphedema and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Indeed, anti-inflammatory foods and their effects on the inflammatory state and on oxidative stress are now being investigated for their possible therapeutic role in lymphedema. Although no special diet has so far been proven to be very effective, specific dietary tips could help in alleviating the edematous state of patients with lymphedema. A few supplements have been tested for lymphedema treatment. Among them, GARLIVE",

      "abstract": "Probiotic microorganisms that are potentially beneficial to the health of the host are commercially available in a great variety of products. Not all microorganism strains present in products have proven beneficial to the health properties. These products include not only foodstuffs but also dietary supplements, food for special medical purposes, medicinal products, as well as cosmetics and medical devices. These products contain from one to a dozen bacterial strains of the same or different species and sometimes also fungal strains. Since the pro-health effects of probiotics depend on a specific strain, the number of its cells in a dose, and the lack of pathogenic microorganisms, it is extremely important to control the quality of probiotics. Depending on the classification of a given product, its form, and its content of microorganisms, the correct determination of the number of microorganisms and their identification is crucial. This article describes the culture-dependent and culture-independent methods for testing the contents of probiotic microorganisms, in addition to biochemical and genetic methods of identification. The microbiological purity requirements for various product categories are also presented. Due to numerous reports on the low quality of probiotic products available on the market, it is important to standardise research methods for this group of products and to increase the frequency of inspections of these products.",

      "abstract": "Achieving adequate micronutrient status, while avoiding deficiencies, represents a challenge for people globally. Consequently, many individuals resort to oral nutrient supplementation (ONS) in order to correct suboptimal dietary intakes. Advances in the fields of nutrigenetics and nutritional genomics have identified differences in response to micronutrient supplementation according to genetic makeup, adding dietary supplement use to the clinician's toolkit in the precision nutrition era. This review focuses on published evidence linking genetic variants to the responses associated with some of the most popular dietary supplements. With an increasing number of health professionals becoming involved in the prescription of ONS, identifying and matching individuals to the appropriate dietary supplement according to their genotype is important for achieving optimal health benefits and micronutrient equilibrium, while reducing the adverse events and financial costs often associated with excessive ONS.",

The main aim of this study was to assess beliefs and knowledge related to nutritional supplements among pharmacy students. A cross-sectional study was conducted in order to assess beliefs and knowledge related to nutritional supplements among pharmacy students. A literature review on nutritional supplements was conducted in order to develop a 24-item questionnaire, and expert indications established its face and content validity. &#932;he sample was comprised of 142 pharmacy students in Cyprus, whose results are presented. The majority of the participants was receiving nutritional supplements (66.9%) and believed that nutritional supplements may interact and may have toxic effects. Those in the higher years of study scored higher in knowledge than those in the lower ones. The mean scores (mean ± SD) on the knowledge about nutritional supplements by the years of study were 9.14 ± 2.67, 8.71 ± 2.92, 9.91 ± 2.08, 11.16 ± 3.00, and 15.76 ± 2.67 and compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction. The level of statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.

      "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects 42 to 56 million individuals worldwide annually. Even more individuals are affected by sub-concussive repetitive head impacts (SRHIs). Such injuries may result in significant acute and chronic symptoms. A study of how individuals may adjust or augment their nutritional and dietary habits to prevent cumulative neurotrauma and promote post-injury recovery is necessary. The objective of the current study is to systematically review nutritional and dietary interventions for neurotrauma prevention and mTBI recovery to direct clinical decision-making and identify future areas of research. This systematic review, without a specified time-period, was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Web of Science followed by a manual search of references. Search strings were generated by a research librarian. Studies were included if they: 1) investigate human subjects with mTBI or SRHI; 2) investigate a supplement/ingredient of dietary supplement sold in the U.S. or dietary intervention without classification as a drug or prohibitive statement against use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); 3) assess a quantifiable outcome; and 4) are published in English in a peer-reviewed journal with an accessible full-length article. Studies were excluded if: 1) the study included non-mTBI or SRHI subjects (e.g., moderate/severe TBI, stroke); 2) mTBI is not assessed separately from moderate/severe mTBI; or 3) the studies that required intracranial hemorrhage. Fifteen studies from 12 unique subject populations met inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 1139 mTBI or SRHI subjects were enrolled across intervention arms in the study populations.

      "abstract": "The market of probiotic foods and supplements is growing rapidly but frequently the commercialized products are not compliant with their labels in terms of claimed probiotic strain(s) and labeled number of viable probiotic cells, thus mining the authenticity of these probiotic products.In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of: (i) the current regulatory aspects, (ii) the consistency of probiotic foods and supplements with their labels, (iii) the implications of mislabeling on the quality, safety and functionality of these products and (iv) the available and most promising methods to assess the authenticity of these products, taking into account the need to discriminate among the different physiological states probiotics might be in the carrier matrices. It arises that authenticity of probiotic foods and supplements is an urgent issue, of industrial and legislation relevance, that need to be addressed. A plethora of methods are available to reach this goal, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Protocols that combine the use of propidium monoazide (PMA) with metagenomics or polyphasic approaches including the PMA real time PCR or flow cytometry (for the viability assessment) and the whole genome sequence analysis (for the identification and typing of the probiotic strain) are the most promising that should be standardized and used by producers and regulators.",

The study protocol was developed following PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021156887). A sensitive search up to January 2022 considered MEDLINE via PubMed and Web of Science, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection via Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane CENTRAL, WHO (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and grey literature. Randomized controlled (SRP with/without placebo) clinical trials (RCTs) on all types of CoQ10 administration were included. The primary outcome was probing pocket depth (PPD). Secondary outcomes were bleeding on probing, clinical attachment loss, and gingival and plaque indices. Twelve RCTs with local and five with systemic CoQ10 administration were included. The study protocols were heterogeneous. Local CoQ10 administration was performed once or several times in a period up to 15 days. Systemic CoQ10 was applied twice or three times daily for six weeks up to four months. The reporting quality was low, including missing information about CoQ10 doses. Risk of bias was high or unclear. About half of the studies reported significant group differences for PPD. Until now, no statement on the effectiveness of CoQ10 in non-surgical periodontitis therapy is possible. Further high-quality RCTs are necessary and should consider the protocol recommendations of this review.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy and Nutritional Supplements for Neovascular Eye Diseases.",
      "abstract": "In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the recent findings about the treatment of neovascular retinal diseases. The use of conventional drugs and nutraceuticals endowed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may support conventional therapies will be considered, with the final aim of achieving risk reduction (prevention) and outcome improvement (cooperation between treatments) of such sight-threatening proliferative retinopathies. For this purpose, we consider a medicinal product one that contains well-defined compound(s) with proven pharmacological and therapeutic effects, usually given for the treatment of full-blown diseases. Rarely are prescription drugs given for preventive purposes. A dietary supplement refers to a compound (often an extract or a mixture) used in the prevention or co-adjuvant treatment of a given pathology. However, it must be kept in mind that drug-supplement interactions may exist and might affect the efficacy of certain drug treatments. Moreover, the distinction between medicinal products and dietary supplements is not always straightforward. For instance, melatonin is formulated as a medicinal product for the treatment of sleep and behavioral problems; at low doses (usually below 1 mg), it is considered a nutraceutical, while at higher doses, it is sold as a psychotropic drug. Despite their lower status with respect to drugs, increasing evidence supports the notion of the beneficial effects of dietary supplements on proliferative retinopathies, a major cause of vision loss in the elderly. Therefore, we believe that, on a patient-by-patient basis, the administration of nutraceuticals, either alone or in association, could benefit many patients, delaying the progression of their disease and likely improving the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs.",

      "title": "Recommending ultra-processed oral nutrition supplements for unintentional weight loss: Are there risks?",
      "abstract": "Oral nutrition supplements (ONS) are widely recommended for the management of unintentional weight loss in patient populations, long-term care residents, and community-dwelling older adults. Most marketed ONS are ultra-processed, with precision nutrition and aseptic composition, as well as convenience and availability, driving their selection. However, therapeutic effectiveness is mixed and the potential health risks of consuming ultra-processed ONS long-term in lieu of less-processed foods have received little attention. A diverse and balanced microbiota supporting immunity and wellness is maintained by a diet rich in plant-sourced foods. The implications of ultra-processed ONS displacing plant-sourced foods, and specifically the potential for undesirable impacts on the gut microbiota, require consideration. Most ONS are either devoid of fiber or are supplemented with isolated or purified fibers that may contribute to adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and appetite suppression. In contrast, the diversity of microbial-available, nondigestible carbohydrates, together with the array of phytochemicals found in plant-sourced foods, support microbial diversity and its resiliency. This review outlines the clinical dilemma of recommending commercial ultra-processed ONS vs nutritionally adequate (eg, high-energy/high-protein) foods and beverages that contribute to diet quality, maintenance of a diverse and stable gut microbiota composition, and support nutrition status and health. Ultra-processed ONS may fall short of expected health benefits, and overreliance may potentially contribute to the risk for patient and older adult populations because of the displacement of a variety of healthful foods.",

      "abstract": "Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) play a key role in the therapy of cancer-cachexia, but adherence to ONS-intake remains challenging. To improve adherence, a wide variety of ONS is crucial. We compared the acceptance and adherence of a commercial liquid ONS (LS) with a newly developed, energy- and protein-rich, semisolid, fruit-gum based product (FG) in oncological patients. Forty cancer patients with indication for artificial nutritional therapy were randomly assigned to LS and FG in crossover design for 4 weeks with a 1-week washout phase in-between. Adherence to ONS was recorded with MARS-D questionnaire. Sensory properties were evaluated and safety monitoring was performed. Energy and nutrient intake, nutrition and performance status and quality of life remained stable in both groups throughout the study (all p-values for the comparison between baseline and after 9 weeks were >0.05). Taste (p=0.004), smell (p=0.025) and enjoyment (p=0.027) of the LS were rated significantly better compared to FG and a higher adherence (p=0.005) for the LS was found. Nevertheless, patients were very interested about the new alternative of ONS, so that 16 of the study participants would buy it or strive for a medical prescription. The balanced, protein-rich ONS based on fruit gum is an innovative formulation that stabilizes nutritional status and might therefore extend the options for nutritional support in cancer patients in the future. However, the sensory properties must first be further improved to increase acceptance and adherence.",

      "abstract": "The Incremental Model of Doping Behaviour suggests doping grows out of the habitual use of performance-enhancing methods (e.g., sport supplements) and belief that they are necessary for performance. Importantly, in this model, doping is viewed as functional rather than moral choice. In two studies, we examined whether sport supplement use was indirectly related to doping use via sport supplement beliefs, and whether personal morality moderated this relationship. Competitive athletes (Study 1, N = 366; Study 2, N = 200) completed measures of supplement use, beliefs, and doping use. They also completed measures of moral values (Study 1) and moral identity (Study 2). In both studies, supplement use was indirectly related to doping use via beliefs. Moreover, this indirect relationship was moderated by moral values (Study 1) and moral identity (Study 2). That is, the relationship between supplement use and doping use via beliefs was negated when moral values and moral identity were high but not when they were low or moderate. Taken together, our findings suggest that sport supplement users, who believe they are necessary, are more likely to dope if they have low moral values and believe that being a moral person is unimportant to their self-image.",

This cross-sectional study used data from a web-based survey conducted in February-March 2022. Participants were Division I (DI) and Division III (DIII) student-athletes of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Chi-square tests were conducted to identify the differences in the prevalence of demographic and athletic characteristics between the divisions. Multivariable odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders to determine the predictors of supplement usage. A total of 247 NCAA student-athletes (72.5% Division I, 27.5% Division III) completed the survey, yielding a 24.5% response rate. There were no significant differences between nutritional supplementation and NCAA divisions. Instead, ",

Addressing accelerated aging involves adaptation of lifestyle and the use of geroprotective drugs and supplements, including nutritional supplements and bioactive compounds. The Food and Drug Administration, under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, categorizes bioactive compounds and medicinal products as dietary supplements. While numerous companies sell ingredients that can be deemed geroprotectors, there's limited oversight in their quality control. Governmental safety authorities only verify the presence of prohibited compounds, not the accuracy of ingredients listed on labels.Here, Nicotinamide mononucleotide and Urolithin A supplements, easily accessible online or in pharmacies, were tested for their active ingredient content. Results showed a significant deviation from the labeled amounts, ranging from + 28.6% to -100%. This indicates a considerable disparity in the quality of geroprotective supplements.To address this variability, collaboration between and within societies representing healthcare professionals, industry and regulatory bodies is imperative to ensure the quality of geroprotective supplements.",

      "abstract": "Aggression in correctional and psychiatric settings is relatively common and has a negative effect on physical and mental health both among inmates/clients and staff, as well as organizational-level functioning. The aim of the present study was to critically review the evidence on the effectiveness of nutritional supplements in reducing aggression and violence to contribute to a better understanding of options available for managing aggressive behaviors in adults. The EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and PubMed databases were searched for effectiveness studies published in English anytime up until March 2020. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Altogether, 14 studies met inclusion criteria; 2 investigated micronutrients, 10 examined macronutrients, while further 2 examined a combination of micro and macronutrients. Out of the 14 studies, 5 reported a beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins/minerals, S-adenosyl-l-methionine, or tryptophan). Five studies did not report a significant beneficial effect of nutritional supplementation (omega-3 fatty acids, folic acid, tryptophan, broad range supplement containing vitamins and fatty acids, and fatty acids in augmentation with valproic acid), while four studies reported mixed effects (on l-tryptophan, broad-range micronutrient formula, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids). The results overall indicated that research in this area is in its infancy: very few studies examined the same composition of nutritional supplementation and when they did so the results were contradictory. The methodological shortcoming of existing studies and directions for future research are discussed to facilitate high-quality research in this evolving area of nutritional psychiatry.",

Without strong action, it is estimated that by 2035 cancer cases will increase by almost 25 %, making this disease the main cause of death. Therefore, the aim of this study is to know the diet and lifestyle guidelines associated to cancer prevention. A literature review has been carried out on the diet and lifestyle guidelines related to a reduction in cancer risk. Strategies to reduce cancer risk include maintaining a healthy weight, being physically active, consuming a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, non-starchy vegetables, and legumes, limit processed and fast food, limit consumption of red meat and eat little, if any, processed meats, drink mostly water and limit the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks, finally reduce, or do not consume alcohol. Prevention is an effective tool to reduce cancer risk. Adequate diet and healthy lifestyle habits can reduce cancer risk as well as other non-communicable diseases and can even have environmental benefits.",

      "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has become an epidemic and has caused a tremendous healthy and economic burden in China, especially after the \"two-child policy\" put into effect on October 2015. The prevalence of GDM has continued to increase during the past few decades and is likely to see a further rise in the future. The public health impact of GDM is becoming more apparent in China and it might lead to the development of chronic non-communicable diseases in the long-term for both mothers and their children. Early identification of high-risk individuals could help to take preventive and intervention measures to reduce the risk of GDM and adverse perinatal outcomes. Therefore, a focus on prevention and intervention of GDM in China is of great importance. Lifestyle interventions, including dietary and physical exercise intervention, are effective and first-line preventive strategies for GDM prevention and intervention. The GDM One-day Care Clinic established in 2011, which educates GDM patients on the basic knowledge of GDM, dietary intervention, physical exercise, weight management, and blood glucose self-monitoring methods, sets a good model for group management of GDM and has been implemented throughout the hospitals as well as maternal and child health centers in China. The current review focus on the prevalence, risk factors, as well as prevention and lifestyle intervention of GDM in China for better understanding of the latest epidemiology of GDM in China and help to improve maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes and promote long-term health for women with GDM.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Advancements in the treatment of CVD have reduced mortality rates, yet the global burden of CVD remains high. Considering that CVD is still largely a preventable disease, prioritizing preventative measures through healthy lifestyle (HL) behaviors is necessary to lessen the burden of CVD. HL behaviors, such as regular exercise, healthy eating habits, adequate sleep, and smoking cessation, can influence a number of traditional CVD risk factors as well as a less commonly measured risk factor, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). It is important to note that cardiac rehabilitation programs, which traditionally have focused on secondary prevention, also emphasize the importance of making comprehensive HL behavior changes. This review discusses preventative measures to reduce the burden of CVD through an increased uptake and assessment of HL behaviors. An overview of the importance of CRF as a risk factor is discussed along with how to improve CRF and other risk factors through HL behavior interventions. The role of the clinician for promoting HL behaviors to prevent CVD is also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are of increasing concern for society and national governments, as well as globally due to their high mortality rate. The main risk factors of NCDs can be classified into the categories of self-management, genetic factors, environmental factors, factors of medical conditions, and socio-demographic factors. The main focus is on the elements of self-management and to reach a consensus about the influence of food on risk management and actions toward the prevention of NCDs at all stages of life. Nutrition interventions are essential in managing the risk of NCDs. As they are of the utmost importance, this review highlights NCDs and their risk factors and outlines several common prevention strategies. We foresee that the best prevention management strategy will include individual (lifestyle management), societal (awareness management), national (health policy decisions), and global (health strategy) elements, with target actions, such as multi-sectoral partnership, knowledge and information management, and innovations. The most effective preventative strategy is the one that leads to changes in lifestyle with respect to diet, physical activities, cessation of smoking, and the control of metabolic disorders.",

      "title": "Global Perspectives on Improving Chronic Disease Prevention and Management in Diverse Settings.",
      "abstract": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define chronic diseases as conditions that last 1 year or more and that require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living, or both (1). Chronic diseases may be influenced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle and social behaviors, health care system factors, community influences, and environmental determinants of health (2). These risk factors often coexist and interact with each other. Therefore, a better understanding of determinants of chronic diseases such as tobacco use, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity stands to benefit from effective strategies for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary disease prevention and management in diverse global settings (3). Strategies to prevent and manage chronic disease outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have global commonalities (4-7). The impact of chronic diseases is disproportionately evident in Black and Brown communities (8,9). Chronic disease prevention and management typically focus on behavioral interventions such as healthy eating, increased physical activity, and cessation of unhealthy practices such as tobacco and alcohol use (10-15). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic added to the fact that chronic diseases disproportionately affect low-resource communities, where many Black and Brown populations live (16,17). COVID-19 demonstrated that chronic disease disparities actually present as preexisting conditions in Black and Brown communities, who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 outcomes. Although most of the articles in this Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) collection were published before the pandemic, the insights they present, combined with the racial and ethnic data on the burden of COVID-19 thus far, support this reality. Many researchers and public health practitioners often consider the need to sufficiently address the relationships between chronic diseases and social, behavioral, and community factors (18). Global lessons in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, therefore, can help researchers and practitioners benefit from the shared lessons and experience derived from research and interventions conducted in different parts of the world. There are more than 7 billion people worldwide, who speak diverse languages and who have different nationalities, identities, and health systems. Yet, if we share challenges and opportunities for chronic disease prevention and management, many of the global adversities to improving health and well-being can be ameliorated, which is the purpose of this collection. The authors in this collection share lessons that represent experiences in diverse contexts across countries and regions of the world.",

      "title": "Comprehensive effects of lifestyle reform, adherence, and related factors on hypertension control: A review.",
      "abstract": "Despite the effectiveness of currently available antihypertensive medications, there is still a need for new treatment strategies that are more effective in certain groups of hypertensive and for additional resources to combat hypertension. However, medication non-adherence was previously recognized as a major problem in the treatment of hypertension. The mechanisms behind the positive impacts of lifestyle changes might occur in different ways. In comparison with other studies, the efficacy and effectiveness of lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive pharmaceutical treatment for the prevention and control of hypertension and concomitant cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated in randomized controlled trials. However, in this review, the attitudinal lifestyle modifications and barriers to blood pressure control were elaborated on. An effective method for reducing blood pressure (BP) and preventing cardiovascular events with antihypertensive medications has been outlined. Maintaining healthy lifestyle factors (body mass index, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, sodium excretion, and sedentary behavior) could lower systolic blood pressure BP by 3.5 mm Hg and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by about 30%, regardless of genetic susceptibility to hypertension. Conducting a lifestyle intervention using health education could improve lifestyle factors, such as reducing salt, sodium, and fat intake, changing eating habits to include more fruits and vegetables, not smoking, consuming less alcohol, exercising regularly, maintaining healthy body weight, and minimizing stressful conditions. Each behavior could affect BP by modulating visceral fat accumulation, insulin resistance, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vascular endothelial function, oxidative stress, inflammation, and autonomic function. Evidence of the joint effect of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle reforms suggests a pathway to reduce hypertension.",

      "title": "Healthy Lifestyle and Cancer Risk: Modifiable Risk Factors to Prevent Cancer.",
      "abstract": "Cancer has become a serious problem worldwide, as it represents the main cause of death, and its incidence has increased over the years. A potential strategy to counter the growing spread of various forms of cancer is the adoption of prevention strategies, in particular, the use of healthy lifestyles, such as maintaining a healthy weight, following a healthy diet; being physically active; avoiding smoking, alcohol consumption, and sun exposure; and vitamin D supplementation. These modifiable risk factors are associated with this disease, contributing to its development, progression, and severity. This review evaluates the relationship between potentially modifiable risk factors and overall cancer development, specifically breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer, and highlights updated recommendations on cancer prevention. The results of numerous clinical and epidemiological studies clearly show the influence of lifestyles on the development and prevention of cancer. An incorrect diet, composed mainly of saturated fats and processed products, resulting in increased body weight, combined with physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and smoking, has induced an increase in the incidence of all three types of cancer under study. Given the importance of adopting correct and healthy lifestyles to prevent cancer, global institutions should develop strategies and environments that encourage individuals to adopt healthy and regular behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The main recommendations from public health entities include healthy diets and physical activity as the main lifestyle factors impacting the development of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancer, and even neurological diseases. Randomized clinical trials have been designed to demonstrate those lifestyle modifications can change the pattern of chronic diseases development and progression. Among these, nutrition is one of the most impacting factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in different randomized clinical trials, and most of them showed a favorable impact of nutrition modification on the participant's health. Nevertheless, study designs were considerably different, and future studies are needed to support nutrition modifications further. The choice of a healthy considered diet, like the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases, cardiovascular risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense, processed foods contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. Besides these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be personalized according to the availability of foods, geographic localizations, and the healthy status of the patient.",

      "abstract": "A sedentary lifestyle, low levels of physical activity and fitness, poor dietary patterns, and psychosocial stress are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Conversely, engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining optimal fitness levels, adhering to a heart-healthy dietary pattern, effectively managing body weight, ensuring adequate sleep, implementing stress-reduction strategies, and addressing psychosocial risk factors are associated with a reduced risk of ASCVD. This comprehensive review synthesizes current evidence from large observational studies and randomized controlled trials on lifestyle factors as determinants of ASCVD health. It also briefly reviews mechanistic insights into how factors such as low shear stress, increased reactive oxygen species production, chronic inflammation, platelets and coagulation activation, endothelial dysfunction, and sympathetic hyperactivity contribute to the initiation and exacerbation of ASCVD risk factors. These include obesity, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, subsequently leading to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, ultimately resulting in chronic ASCVD or acute cardiovascular events. To bridge the translational gap between epidemiologic and trial-based evidence and clinical practice, practical recommendations are summarized to facilitate the translation of scientific knowledge into actionable interventions to promote ASCVD health. Acknowledged is the gap between the evidence-based knowledge and adoption within healthcare systems, which remains a crucial objective in advancing cardiovascular health at the population level.",

Therefore, combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs) are a potentially valuable prevention approach. This review aims to provide an overview of existing CLIs for the prevention and management of asthma or COPD. (2) Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. Studies were included if CLIs targeted at least two lifestyle factors. (3) Results: Among the 56 included studies, 9 addressed asthma and 47 addressed COPD management, with no studies focusing on prevention. For both conditions, the most prevalent combination of lifestyle targets was diet and physical activity (PA), often combined with smoking cessation in COPD. The studied CLIs led to improvements in quality of life, respiratory symptoms, body mass index/weight, and exercise capacity. Behavioural changes were only measured in a limited number of studies and mainly showed improvements in dietary intake and PA level. (4) Conclusions: CLIs are effective within asthma and COPD management. Next to optimising the content and implementation of CLIs, these positive results warrant paying more attention to CLIs for persons with an increased risk profile for these chronic respiratory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Dyslipidemia, characterized by abnormal blood lipid levels, is a major public health concern due to its association with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiometabolic disorders. In this context, appropriate nutrition patterns are pivotal as they represent the basic approach for providing a wide range of substantial advantages. The best evidence for dyslipidemia management is offered by the Mediterranean Diet, the Plant-Based Diet, the High-Fiber Diet and the Anti-inflammatory Diet, while the DASH Diet and the Ketogenic Diet have also been shown to target additional pathological features like hypertension and other comorbidities. The bioactive compounds that are enriched in these nutrition patterns and able to manage dyslipidemia include monounsaturated fatty acids such as ω-3, polyphenols such as oleuropein, resveratrol, flavonoids, and catechins, carotenoids, phytosterols and soluble and unsoluble fibers. Diets rich in these compounds can improve lipid profile by mitigating oxidative stress, reducing low-grade chronic inflammation, modulating macronutrient absorption and other mechanisms, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. Additionally, lifestyle interventions such as regular physical activity, weight loss, reduced alcohol consumption and smoking cessation further ameliorate lipid metabolism and manage circulated lipid profile. Furthermore, emerging insights from nutrigenomics underscore the potential for proper diet to address genetic factors and optimize treatment outcomes. The pivotal role of nutrition interventions in the context of dyslipidemia and its cardiometabolic implications is discussed in this review, emphasizing evidence-based and personalized approaches.",

      "title": "Exercise as a therapeutic modality for the prevention and treatment of depression.",
      "abstract": "While maintaining an active lifestyle and engaging in regular exercise are known to promote cardiovascular (CV) health, increasing evidence has emerged to indicate that these lifestyle behaviors also can promote psychological health and well-being. This has led to research to determine if exercise can serve as a potential therapeutic modality for major depressive disorder (MDD), which is a leading cause of mental-health impairment and overall disability worldwide. The strongest evidence to support this use comes from an increasing number of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have compared exercise to usual care, placebo controls, or established therapies in healthy adults and in various clinical populations. The relatively large number of RCTs has led to numerous reviews and meta-analyses, which generally have been concordant in indicating that exercise ameliorates depressive symptoms, improves self-esteem, and enhances various aspects of quality of life. Together, these data indicate that exercise should be considered as a therapeutic modality for improving CV health and psychological well-being. The emerging evidence also has led to a new proposed subspecialty of \"lifestyle psychiatry\", which promotes the use of exercise as an adjunctive treatment for patients with MDD. Indeed, some medical organizations have now endorsed lifestyle-based approaches as foundational aspects of depression management, with adoption of exercise as a treatment option for MDD. This review summarizes research in the area and provides practical suggestions for the use of exercise in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Dietetic and lifestyle recommendations for stone formers.",
      "abstract": "Nutrition is tightly associated with the risk of stone events. A part from genetic predisposition, a correct and balanced diet might prevent incident kidney stones. Several studies analyzed each dietary component and different diets to better understand their impact on stone recurrence. Fluids: High fluids intake is the most important factor for preventing kidney stones disease and for every 200 mL of water, the risk of stones is reduced by 13%. Soft drinks seems to be associated to a greater risk of stone events, whereas caffeine and citrus fruits juice are not. Calcium: Normally calcium intake with diet does not exceed 1.2 g/day. A balanced consumption of dairy products is capable of reducing oxalate intestinal absorption and urinary excretion compared to low calcium diet, being protective for stone disease. Oxalate: The exact amount of oxalate contained in different foods is difficult to estimate for its variability, even in the same aliment. In addition, the amount of oxalate consumed was shown to be only a minor risk factor for stone disease, whereas its intestinal absorption is strongly influenced by external factors, such as calcium intake. Dietary oxalate restriction is advisable only in patients with known elevated consumption. Sodium: High sodium intake is both associated with hypertension, heart disease and stone risk. Increased sodium consumption is directly associated to hypercalciuria in both calcium stone formers and healthy subjects. Although dietary sodium restriction to recommended values is always desirable in stone formers, it is difficult to achieve for its broad use in food preparation. Proteins: Animal proteins are associated to increased risk for stone formation, whereas vegetable and dairy proteins are not. Increased meat intake was associated to acidic urine pH, negative calcium balance and reduced anti-lithogenic urinary solutes excretion.Fruits and vegetables: Alkalizing foods are one of the most important factors for stone protection. Their consumption increases anti-lithogenic solutes as citrate, potassium and magnesium. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables is strongly recommended for stone formers. Uric acid: Elevated meat consumption is either associated to increased purine metabolism and acid load, favoring uric acid nephrolithiasis by reducing urine pH and increasing urinary excretion of uric acid, especially in patients affected by metabolic syndrome and diabetes.In conclusion, the most effective diet for stone protection is rich in fruits and vegetables, low in animal proteins and salt, with balanced dairy product consumption and obviously, with elevated fluid intake. These characteristics make vegetarian and Mediterranean diets protective and useful for stone formers, whereas western diet is at risk for stone formation.",

      "title": "The Effect of Ketogenic Diet on Shared Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer.",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the first and second leading causes of death worldwide, respectively. Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that the incidence of cancer is elevated in patients with CVD and vice versa. However, these conditions are usually regarded as separate events despite the presence of shared risk factors between both conditions, such as metabolic abnormalities and lifestyle. Cohort studies suggested that controlling for CVD risk factors may have an impact on cancer incidence. Therefore, it could be concluded that interventions that improve CVD and cancer shared risk factors may potentially be effective in preventing and treating both diseases. The ketogenic diet (KD), a low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, has been widely prescribed in weight loss programs for metabolic abnormalities. Furthermore, recent research has investigated the effects of KD on the treatment of numerous diseases, including CVD and cancer, due to its role in promoting ketolysis, ketogenesis, and modifying many other metabolic pathways with potential favorable health effects. However, there is still great debate regarding prescribing KD in patients either with CVD or cancer. Considering the number of studies on this topic, there is a clear need to summarize potential mechanisms through which KD can improve cardiovascular health and control cell proliferation. In this review, we explained the history of KD, its types, and physiological effects and discussed how it could play a role in CVD and cancer treatment and prevention.",

We examined the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in children from minority ethnic populations in Western high-income countries (HICs). Our systematic review included 53 studies, involving 26,045 children from minority ethnic populations who followed lifestyle intervention programmes lasting between 8 weeks and 5 years with the aim of preventing and/or managing childhood obesity and associated comorbidities, including adiposity and cardiometabolic risks. The studies were heterogenous in terms of lifestyle intervention components (nutrition, PA, behavioural counselling) and settings (community vs. schools and after-school settings). Our meta-analysis included 31 eligible studies and showed no significant effects of lifestyle interventions when they focused on body mass index (BMI) outcomes (pooled BMI mean change = -0.09 (95% CI = -0.19, 0.01); ",

Childhood offers a unique opportunity for preventing, modifying, or eliminating risk factors and, in doing so, reversing or slowing the process of atherosclerosis. In general, management involves targeted lifestyle interventions such as strict dietary changes and increases in physical activity.

      "abstract": "The key aim of diabetes management is to prevent complications, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. At an individual level, people with diabetes are less likely than they were several decades ago to experience classical macrovascular and microvascular complications as a result of improvements in modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and preventive healthcare. However, a significant burden of diabetes complications persists at a population level because of the increasing incidence of diabetes, as well as longer lifetime exposure to diabetes because of younger diagnosis and increased life expectancy. Trials have shown that the most effective strategy for preventing complications of diabetes is a multifactorial approach focussing simultaneously on the management of diet, exercise, glucose levels, blood pressure and lipids. In addition to the cornerstone strategies of addressing diet, exercise and lifestyle measures, the introduction of newer glucose-lowering agents, including sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, have brought about a paradigm shift in preventing the onset and progression of complications of type 2 diabetes, particularly cardiovascular and renal disease. The improvement in rates of classical complications of diabetes over time has been accompanied by a growing awareness of non-traditional complications, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. These emerging complications may not respond to a glycaemic-centred approach alone and highlight the importance of foundational strategies centred on lifestyle measures and supported by pharmaceutical therapy to achieve weight loss and reduce metabolic risk in patients living with diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Poor lifestyle habits, such as physical inactivity and poor diets, are highly prevalent within society and even more so among patients with chronic disease. The need to stem poor lifestyle habits has led to the development of a new field of Lifestyle Medicine, whose mission is to prevent, treat, and even reverse chronic diseases through lifestyle interventions. Three fields within Cardiology relate to this mission: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Preventive Cardiology, and Behavioral Cardiology. Each of these three fields have contributed substantially to the reduction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The historic contributions of these three cardiac fields are reviewed as well as the challenges each of these fields has faced in optimizing the application of lifestyle medicine practices. A shared agenda between Cardiology and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine could further the utilization of behavioral interventions. This review suggests seven steps that could be shared by these organizations and other medical societies. First, there is a need to develop and promulgate the assessment of lifestyle factors as \"vital signs\" during patient visits. Second, developing a strong partnership between the fields of Cardiology and Physiatry could improve important aspects of cardiac care, including a potential redesign of cardiac stress testing. Third, behavioral evaluations should be optimized at patients' entrée points into medical care since these may be considered \"windows of opportunity\". Fourth, there is a need to broaden cardiac rehabilitation into inexpensive programs and make this program eligible for patients with risk factors but no known CVD. Fifth, lifestyle medicine education should be integrated into the core competencies for relevant specialties. Sixth, there is a need for inter-societal advocacy to promote lifestyle medicine practices. Seventh, the well-being effects of healthy lifestyle behaviors, such as their impact on one's sense of vitality, should be emphasized.",

Although these developments led to many positive changes in health outcomes and increased life expectancies, they all also caused inappropriate dietary patterns, physical inactivity and obesity. Evidence shows that a large proportion of the cardiovascular disease burden can be explained by behavioural factors such as low physical activity, unhealthy diet and smoking. Controlling these risk factors from early ages is important for maintaining cardiovascular health. Even in patients with genetic susceptibility to cardiovascular disease, risk factor modification is beneficial.Despite the tremendous advances in the medical treatment of cardiovascular risk factors to reduce overall cardiovascular risk, the modern lifestyle which has led to greater sedentary time, lower participation in active transport and time spent in leisure or purposeful physical activity, unhealthy diets and increased exposure to stress, noise and pollution have diminished the beneficial effects of contemporary medical cardiovascular prevention strategies. Therefore attenuating or eliminating these health risk behaviours and risk factors is imperative in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",

      "abstract": "Different investigations lead to the urgent need to generate validated clinical protocols as a tool for medical doctors to orientate patients under risk for a preventive approach to control Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, there is consensus that the combined effects of risk factors for the disease can be modified according to lifestyle, thus controlling at least 40% of cases. The other fraction of cases are derived from candidate genes and epigenetic components as a relevant factor in AD pathogenesis. At this point, it appears to be of critical relevance the search for molecular biomarkers that may provide information on probable pathological events and alert about early detectable risks to prevent symptomatic events of the disease. These precocious detection markers will then allow early interventions of non-symptomatic subjects at risk. Here, we summarize the status and potential avenues of prevention and highlight the usefulness of biological and reliable markers for AD.",

      "abstract": "Cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases are leading causes of death and morbidity in ageing populations. While numerous cohort studies show inverse associations of presumably healthy lifestyles and cardiovascular risk factors, the causal link to many modifiable behaviors is still insufficiently evidence-based. Because of bias of studies and heterogeneity of results, we performed a systematic review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and observational studies on lifestyle patterns including nutrition, physical activity, smoking, and weight versus incidence and mortality of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. A search string retrieved 624 references in PubMed covering the last five years. Two researchers screened titles and abstracts independently but with equivalent results. Nineteen references met the inclusion criteria. Results affirm that high adherence to plant-based diets, including components such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, low-fat dairy, olive oil, nuts, and low intake of sodium, sweetened beverages, alcohol, and red and processed meats, results in lower risk of vascular outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Physical activity quantified as walking pace or cardiorespiratory fitness yielded an inverse effect on stroke. Health measures such as smoking status, BMI and increase in body weight are associated with substantial risk of the incidence of and mortality from cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, while strong adherence to an overall prudent lifestyle lowered the risk of cardiovascular disease by 66 % and that stroke by 60 %. In summary, increasing numbers of and adherence to health behaviors may markedly lower the burden of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. However, future research should focus on randomized controlled trials to test for causal relationships.",

Much of this burden is mediated by the effects of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors on overweight and obesity, and disproportionally impacts certain population groups-including those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Combined lifestyle interventions (CLIs), which target multiple behaviors, have the potential to prevent CMD, but their implementation, reach and effectiveness in routine practice are often limited. Considering the increasing availability of effective but expensive pharmaceutical options for weight loss, we review the short-term and long-term benefits and cost-effectiveness of CLIs on overweight, obesity and associated CMDs, in controlled studies and in routine care. Against the backdrop of changing living environments, we discuss the effective components of CLIs and the many challenges associated with implementing them. Finally, we outline future directions for research and implications for policy and practice to improve lifestyle behaviors and cardiometabolic health at the population level.",

      "abstract": "Increased life expectancy combined with the aging baby boomer generation has resulted in an unprecedented global expansion of the elderly population. The growing population of older adults and increased rate of age-related chronic illness has caused a substantial socioeconomic burden. The gradual and progressive age-related decline in hormone production and action has a detrimental impact on human health by increasing risk for chronic disease and reducing life span. This article reviews the age-related decline in hormone production, as well as age-related biochemical and body composition changes that reduce the bioavailability and actions of some hormones. The impact of hormonal changes on various chronic conditions including frailty, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dementia are also discussed. Hormone replacement therapy has been attempted in many clinical trials to reverse and/or prevent the hormonal decline in aging to combat the progression of age-related diseases. Unfortunately, hormone replacement therapy is not a panacea, as it often results in various adverse events that outweigh its potential health benefits. Therefore, except in some specific individual cases, hormone replacement is not recommended. Rather, positive lifestyle modifications such as regular aerobic and resistance exercise programs and/or healthy calorically restricted diet can favorably affect endocrine and metabolic functions and act as countermeasures to various age-related diseases. We provide a critical review of the available data and offer recommendations that hopefully will form the groundwork for physicians/scientists to develop and optimize new endocrine-targeted therapies and lifestyle modifications that can better address age-related decline in heath.",

The conditions are together some of the most prevalent and severe multimorbidities and include conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease and stroke. People with these conditions are at a higher risk of all-cause death and have a reduction in life expectancy when compared to patients without cardio-metabolic disorders. As a result of the increasing prevalence and impact of cardio-metabolic multimorbidity on disability, no healthcare system can 'treat' its way out of this pandemic. 'Treating our way out' requires the use of multiple medications which can lead to improper prescribing, insufficient compliance, overdosing or underdosing, improper drug choice, insufficient monitoring, unfavourable drug effects, and drug interactions and inappropriate wastes and costs. Therefore, individuals living with these conditions should be empowered to adopt lifestyle changes that foster independent living with their conditions. Adopting these healthy lifestyles such as smoking cessation, improving dietary habits, sleep hygiene and physical activity is a suitable adjunctive measure if not an alternative to polypharmacy in cardio-metabolic multimorbidity.",

      "abstract": "The fact that up to one-third of the 800,000 yearly cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths in the United States may be preventable by diet and physical activity makes a compelling case for lifestyle interventions as a primary prevention strategy. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends offering or referring adults with CVD risk factors to behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. Although few US adults have ideal cardiovascular health, there exists a dose-response relationship whereby an increasing number of ideal cardiovascular health metrics is associated with lower CVD and all-cause mortality. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet and the Mediterranean diet have proven benefits in reducing CVD. Among individuals without CVD, high levels of physical activity are associated with an approximately 32% reduced risk of CVD death, and moderate levels are associated with approximately a 22% reduction. Resistance exercises confer additional benefits.",

Among these, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome have significant impacts on stroke. Hypertension is the greatest risk factor for stroke among lifestyle-related diseases. Among the medical treatments for lifestyle-related diseases, antihypertensive management is the most important. Recently, due to lifestyle changes such as westernization of diet and lack of exercise, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome has been increasing. They significantly affect atherothrombotic cerebral and lacunar infarctions. However, a few patients with lifestyle-related diseases remain untreated. Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases are extremely important to reduce the risk of stroke. Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption are risk factors for stroke. Guidelines for lifestyle factors are important for stroke prevention.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represent an escalating global health challenge, contributing significantly to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Evidence from large cohort studies and clinical trials underscores the impact of diabetes and obesity as major risk factors for CVD, causing systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and neurohormonal activation. Frequently, a sedentary lifestyle and unbalanced dietary habits are associated with these risk factors. Physical activity and exercise training interventions, a Mediterranean and plant-based diet, smoking cessation, and reduction of alcohol have shown promise in mitigating these risks. The implementation of lifestyle and pharmacotherapy have emerged as new pillars of preventive medicine. This review discusses the evidence of lifestyle interventions to reduce the burden of diabetes, obesity, and CVD. It is highlighted that only a multifaceted, sustained approach integrating lifestyle interventions and pharmacological strategies can reduce the burden of disease and improve long-term outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy-related endocrinopathies, affecting up to 25% of pregnancies globally. GDM increases the risk of perinatal and delivery complications, and the chance of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications, including cardiovascular diseases. This elevated risk is then passed on to the next generation, creating a cycle of metabolic dysfunction across generations. For many years, GDM preventive measures have had inconsistent results, but recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have identified promising new preventative routes. This review aims to summarize the evidence investigating the efficacy of lifestyle treatments for the prevention of GDM and to summarize the effects of two lifestyle interventions, including physical activity and dietary interventions. Based on the present research, future studies should be conducted to investigate whether initiating lifestyle interventions during the preconception period is more beneficial in preventing GDM. In addition, research targeting pregnancy should be designed with a personalized approach. Therefore, studies should customize intervention approaches depending on the presence of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors at the individual level.",

      "abstract": "A healthy diet and an active lifestyle are both effective ways to prevent, manage, and treat many diseases, including cancer. A healthy, well-balanced diet not only ensures that the body gets the right amount of nutrients to meet its needs, but it also lets the body get substances that protect against and/or prevent certain diseases. It is now clear that obesity is linked to long-term diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The main reasons for people being overweight or obese are having bad eating habits and not moving around enough. Maintaining weight in the normal range may be one of the best things to avoid cancer. It has been scientifically proven that those who perform regular physical activity are less likely to develop cancer than those who lead a sedentary lifestyle. Moving regularly not only helps to maintain a normal body weight, avoiding the effects that favor tumor growth in overweight subjects, but also makes the immune system more resistant by counteracting the growth of tumor cells. Physical activity also helps prevent cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In this review, it is highlighted that the association between the Mediterranean diet and physical activity triggers biological mechanisms capable of counteracting the low-grade chronic inflammation found in patients with cancer. This assumes that healthy lifestyles associated with cancer therapies can improve the expectations and quality of life of cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Current lifestyles bring about an increasing prevalence of unhealthy habits that can negatively affect male fertility. Cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, stress, inadequate physical activity, an unequilibrated diet leading to obesity, and use of mobile telephones and portable electronic devices can affect the male reproductive system through multiple mechanisms. Moreover, the modern man is often exposed to environmental factors independent of his will, such as air pollution, exposure to heat or toxicants in his workplace, or the presence of harmful chemicals in food, beverages, agricultural and industrial products, etc. The susceptibility to these factors depends on genetic and epigenetic predisposition, potentially present systemic disease and medication, and local affections of the genitourinary system. The multifaceted nature of both the causative factors and the susceptibility background makes the resulting fertility disturbance highly individual and variable among different men exposed to the same conditions. This paper critically reviews the current knowledge of different causative and susceptibility factors with a special attention to the molecular mechanisms of their action. Finally, strategies for the prevention of abnormalities due to lifestyle and environmental factors and available treatment modalities for already-present abnormalities are exposed.",

      "abstract": "The lack of effective treatments for cognitive decline in older adults has led to an interest in the possibility that lifestyle interventions can help to prevent changes in mental functioning and reduce the risk for dementia. Multiple lifestyle factors have been related to risk for decline, and multicomponent intervention studies suggest that changing older adults' behaviors can have a positive impact on their cognition. How to translate these findings into a practical model for clinical use with older adults, however, is not clear. In this Commentary, we propose a shared decision-making model to support clinicians' efforts to promote brain health in older persons. The model organizes risk and protective factors into three broad groups based on their mechanism of action and provides older persons with basic information to allow them to make evidence- and preference-based choices in choosing goals for effective brain health programs. A final component includes basic instruction in behavior change strategies such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and problem-solving. The implementation of the model will support older persons' efforts to develop a personally relevant and effective brainhealthy lifestyle that may help to reduce their risk for cognitive decline.",

Accurate measurement of metabolic responses to brown fat activation, including heat generation and increased energy expenditure is essential for characterizing thermogenic phenotypes in preclinical studies. Here, we describe two methods for assessing thermogenic phenotypes in mice under non-basal states. First, we describe a protocol for measuring body temperature in cold-treated mice using implantable temperature transponders, which allow for continuous monitoring of body temperature. Second, we describe a method for using indirect calorimetry to measure β3-adrenergic agonist-stimulated changes in oxygen consumption, a proxy for thermogenic fat activation.",

      "abstract": "Fever is a common symptom of influenza and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet its physiological role in host resistance to viral infection remains less clear. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of mice to the high ambient temperature of 36 °C increases host resistance to viral pathogens including influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). High heat-exposed mice increase basal body temperature over 38 °C to enable more bile acids production in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. The gut microbiota-derived deoxycholic acid (DCA) and its plasma membrane-bound receptor Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling increase host resistance to influenza virus infection by suppressing virus replication and neutrophil-dependent tissue damage. Furthermore, the DCA and its nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist protect Syrian hamsters from lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that certain bile acids are reduced in the plasma of COVID-19 patients who develop moderate I/II disease compared with the minor severity of illness group. These findings implicate a mechanism by which virus-induced high fever increases host resistance to influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 in a gut microbiota-dependent manner.",

The energy expenditure (EE) can be categorized into various obligatory and facultative processes. In sedentary adults, basal metabolic rate is the largest contributor to total daily EE, and interindividual variability can be significant. Additional EE is required for digesting and metabolizing food, thermoregulatory adaptation to cold, and to support exercise and nonexercise body movements. Interindividual variability also exists for these EE processes, even after controlling for known factors. The complex mechanisms of interindividual variability in EE can have genetic and environmental origins and require further investigation. Exploration of interindividual variability in EE and its underlying factors holds importance to metabolic health, as it may predict disease risk, and be useful in the personalization of preventative and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Social rank in a structured society has been linked to basal levels of glucocorticoids in various species, with dominant individuals generally presenting lower levels than subordinates. The biotic and abiotic factors influencing glucocorticoids levels across social ranks are still, however, unclear in fishes. We investigated the influences of group size, fish size, sex, age, and reproduction type, plus water salinity and temperature, on the basal levels of cortisol, the major stress hormone in fishes. A phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis was performed on data from 72 studies over 22 species of fishes. As expected, dominants generally exhibited lower levels of cortisol than subordinates. More importantly, the strength of the correlation between cortisol and rank was modulated by three main factors, group size, environmental temperature, and fish size. Differences in basal cortisol between dominants and subordinates were significantly greater in small groups (dyadic contexts) when compared to larger groups. Differences between dominants and subordinates were also greater in temperate regions when compared to the tropics, and in species with larger body size. These results provide valuable insights into the links among hierarchy, stress and metabolism in fishes.",

      "abstract": "Biomedical data often exhibit jumps or abrupt changes. For example, women's basal body temperature may jump at ovulation, menstruation, implantation, and miscarriage. These sudden changes make these data challenging to model: many methods will oversmooth the sharp changes or overfit in response to measurement error. We develop horseshoe process regression (HPR) to address this problem. We define a horseshoe process as a stochastic process in which each increment is horseshoe-distributed. We use the horseshoe process as a nonparametric Bayesian prior for modeling a potentially nonlinear association between an outcome and its continuous predictor, which we implement via Stan and in the R package HPR. We provide guidance and extensions to advance HPR's use in applied practice: we introduce a Bayesian imputation scheme to allow for interpolation at unobserved values of the predictor within the HPR; include additional covariates via a partial linear model framework; and allow for monotonicity constraints. We find that HPR performs well when fitting functions that have sharp changes. We apply HPR to model women's basal body temperatures over the course of the menstrual cycle.",

      "abstract": "All organisms use limited energy to grow, survive, and reproduce, necessitating energy allocation tradeoffs, but there is debate over how selection impacted metabolic budgets and tradeoffs in primates, including humans. Here, we develop a method to compare metabolic rates as quotients of observed relative to expected values for mammals corrected for size, body composition, environmental temperature, and phylogenetic relatedness. Contrary to previous analyses, these quotients reveal that nonhuman primates have total metabolic rates expected for similar-sized mammals in similar environments. In addition, data from several small-scale societies show that humans evolved exceptionally high resting, activity, and total metabolic rates apparently by overcoming tradeoffs between resting and active energy expenditures that constrain other primates. Enhanced metabolic rates help humans fuel expanded brains, faster reproductive rates, extended longevity, and high percentage of body fat.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of endothermy in vertebrates is a major research topic in recent decades that has been tackled by a myriad of research disciplines including paleontology, anatomy, physiology, evolutionary and developmental biology. The ability of most mammals to maintain a relatively constant and high body temperature is considered a key adaptation, enabling them to successfully colonize new habitats and harsh environments. It has been proposed that in mammals the anterior nasal cavity, which houses the maxilloturbinal, plays a pivotal role in body temperature maintenance, via a bony system supporting an epithelium involved in heat and moisture conservation. The presence and the relative size of the maxilloturbinal has been proposed to reflect the endothermic conditions and basal metabolic rate in extinct vertebrates. We show that there is no evidence to relate the origin of endothermy and the development of some turbinal bones by using a comprehensive dataset of µCT-derived maxilloturbinals spanning most mammalian orders. Indeed, we demonstrate that neither corrected basal metabolic rate nor body temperature significantly correlate with the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal. Instead, we identify important variations in the relative surface area, morpho-anatomy, and complexity of the maxilloturbinal across the mammalian phylogeny and species ecology.",

There were no furnishings in the room except for a 1500-W space heater and a stroller. The following morning, emergency personnel were summoned to the residence. A caretaker said the decedent was playing normally 5 min before making the 911 call. The decedent's initial rectal temperature was 42.2°C. Law enforcement asked how long the child had to be exposed to a high temperature in order to induce fatal hyperthermia in an empty bedroom. The scene was reconstructed using the child's residence and the same heater. Environmental data were gathered over a 16-h period. The thermal parameters of the room and environment were analyzed using a lumped-element thermal model. These parameters were then fed into an adapted Gagge's two-node model of human thermal regulation, which provided a time-window of exposure necessary to elicit hyperthermia, which in this case, depending on certain variables, ranged from 45 min to 4 h.",

      "abstract": "This review explores the effects of oestrogen and progesterone fluctuations across the menstrual cycle on fluid and electrolyte balance. The review aims to provide information on this topic for the exercising female but also for researchers working in this field. Beginning with a basic introduction to fluid and electrolyte balance, the review goes on to describe how oestrogen and progesterone have independent and integrated roles to play in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Despite evidence that oestrogen can influence the osmotic threshold for arginine vasopressin release, and that progesterone can influence aldosterone production, these actions do not appear to influence fluid retention, plasma volume changes at rest and during exercise, or electrolyte losses. However, the large inter-individual variations in hormonal fluctuations throughout the menstrual cycle may mean that specific individuals with high fluctuations could experience disturbances in their fluid and electrolyte balance. During phases of oestrogen dominance (e.g. late-follicular phase) heat dissipation is promoted, while progesterone dominance (e.g. mid-luteal phase) promotes heat conservation with overall higher basal body temperature. However, these responses do not consistently lead to any change in observed sweat rates, heat-stress, or dehydration during exercise. Finally, the literature does not support any difference in fluid retention during post-exercise rehydration periods conducted at different menstrual cycle phases. Although these mean responses largely reveal no effects on fluid and electrolyte balance, further research is required particularly in those individuals who experience high hormonal fluctuations, and greater exploration of oestrogen to progesterone interactions is warranted.",

      "abstract": "The basal body temperature (BBT) in women is biphasic, with high- and low-temperature phases during the menstrual cycle. Biphasic BBT predicts the date of ovulation for contraception and family planning. Although the BBT is measured with a basal thermometer at rest, upon waking up, it is often tedious to measure for women. Additionally, the single measured values are not sufficient to reflect biphasic BBT. To solve these problems, various wearable devices have been developed. In the present review, we introduce these devices, compare them to other available basal thermometers, and discuss possible future devices. Wearable devices used to measure skin temperature, ear canal temperature, and temperature in clothes during nighttime to predict BBT (the type of bracelet, ring, armband, ear, and waist), have been developed. These devices are convenient for users, because they measure and record temperature automatically during the nighttime instead of every morning. The scientific evidence was most documented for the type of bracelet, wherein the wrist skin temperature measured during the nighttime reflected the biphasic BBT and predicted the date of ovulation.

      "title": "Gut Microbial Community and Host Thermoregulation in Small Mammals.",
      "abstract": "The endotherms, particularly the small mammals living in the polar region and temperate zone, are faced with extreme challenges for maintaining stable core body temperatures in harsh cold winter. The non-hibernating small mammals increase metabolic rate including obligatory thermogenesis (basal/resting metabolic rate, BMR/RMR) and regulatory thermogenesis (mainly nonshivering thermogenesis, NST, in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) to maintain thermal homeostasis in cold conditions. A substantial amount of evidence indicates that the symbiotic gut microbiota are sensitive to air temperature, and play an important function in cold-induced thermoregulation, via bacterial metabolites and byproducts such as short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids. Cold signal is sensed by specific thermosensitive transient receptor potential channels (thermo-TRPs), and then norepinephrine (NE) is released from sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and thyroid hormones also increase to induce NST. Meanwhile, these neurotransmitters and hormones can regulate the diversity and compositions of the gut microbiota. Therefore, cold-induced NST is controlled by both Thermo-TRPs-SNS-gut microbiota axis and thyroid-gut microbiota axis. Besides physiological thermoregulation, small mammals also rely on behavioral regulation, such as huddling and coprophagy, to maintain energy and thermal homeostasis, and the gut microbial community is involved in these processes. The present review summarized the recent progress in the gut microbiota and host physiological and behavioral thermoregulation in small mammals for better understanding the evolution and adaption of holobionts (host and symbiotic microorganism). The coevolution of host-microorganism symbionts promotes individual survival, population maintenance, and species coexistence in the ecosystems with complicated, variable environments.",

      "abstract": "Calsequestrin 1 (CASQ1) and Ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) are two of the main players in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. CASQ1-knockout mice and mice carrying a mutation in RYR1 (Y522S) linked to human malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) both suffer lethal hypermetabolic episodes when exposed to halothane (MHS crises) and to environmental heat (heat stroke, HS). The phenotype of Y522S is more severe than that of CASQ1-null mice. As MHS and HS are hypermetabolic responses, we studied the metabolism of adult CASQ1-null and Y522S mice using wild-type (WT) mice as controls. We found that CASQ1-null and Y522S mice have increased food consumption and higher core temperature at rest. By indirect calorimetry, we then verified that CASQ1-null and Y522S mice show an increased oxygen consumption and a lower respiratory quotient (RQ). The accelerated metabolism of CASQ1-null and Y522S mice was also accompanied with a reduction in body fat. Moreover, both mouse models displayed increased oxygen consumption and a higher core temperature during heat stress. The results collected suggest that metabolic rate, oxygen consumption, and body temperature at rest, all more elevated in Y522S than in CASQ1-null mice, could possibly be used as predictors of the level of susceptibility to hyperthermic crises of mice (and possibly humans).",

      "abstract": "For small birds to survive during seasonal acclimatization in temperate zones, regulation of body mass and thermogenesis is crucial. To determine the role of temperature and photoperiod in seasonal changes in body mass and thermogenesis in Chinese hwameis (Garrulax canorus), we compared body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR), energy intake and cellular metabolic capacity of the tissue (muscle) and/or organs (liver, kidney, heart and small intestine) in seasonally acclimatized and laboratory-acclimated hwameis. A significant seasonal influence on body mass and BMR (which peaked in winter) was found, and these variations were mirrored by exposing the housed birds to cold temperatures or a short photoperiod. The level of dry matter intake, gross energy intake and digestible energy intake was higher during winter, and in housed animals that were exposed to cold temperatures. These results suggest that by increasing energy intake and thermogenesis, Chinese hwameis can overcome winter thermoregulatory challenges. When compared with warm-acclimated birds, cold-acclimated birds displayed higher mass-specific and whole-organ state 4 respiration in the muscle, liver and kidney, and higher mass-specific and whole-organ cytochrome c oxidase activity in the liver. These data demonstrate that cellular thermogenesis partly underpins basal thermoregulation in Chinese hwameis. Cold temperature and short photoperiod can be used as helpful environmental cues during seasonal acclimatization. However, the role of temperature is more significant compared with that of photoperiod in Chinese hwameis; the changes in energy metabolism and thermoregulation induced by temperature appear to be intensified by photoperiod.",

      "title": "Dietary L-citrulline influences body temperature and inflammatory responses during nitric oxide synthase inhibition and endotoxin challenge in chickens.",
      "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed the role of L-citrulline (L-CIT) in thermoregulation, but very little is known about the mechanisms involved. In this study, nitric oxide synthase inhibition and endotoxin-induced fever were used to investigate the effects of L-CIT on body temperature and inflammatory responses. In experiment 1, NW-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 150 mg/kg BW), was i. p. injected into chicks fed with basal (CON) or L-CIT diets for 14 days. In experiment 2, Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 2 mg/kg BW) was i. p. injected following 21d feeding with CON or L-CIT diets. In experiment 3, chickens were injected with either L-NAME, LPS, or L-NAME + LPS following 26 days feeding with CON or L-CIT diets. The rectal (RT), ear (ET), and core body temperature (CBT) of chickens were examined. Results showed that L-NAME effectively decreased the RT, ET, CBT, and plasma NO concentration. In contrast, LPS increased NO levels and initiated hyperthermia by increasing RT, ET, CBT, and PGE2 levels. L-CIT diet reduced the mean CBT in experiment 1 and diminished the NO level, PGE2 level, and mean RT in experiment 3. Co-administration of L-CIT + LPS upregulated IL-6 expression, whereas, LPS injection alone induced IL-10, IL-1β, and TLR4 gene expressions. Therefore, this study reveals that L-CIT-induced hypothermia was related to NO inhibition and a decrease in PGE2 concentration. Conversely, LPS induced hyperthermia was associated with an increase in both NO and PGE2 concentrations.",

      "title": "Adrenal insufficiency in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome.",
      "abstract": "The generalized dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the most likely cause of hypogonadism, inadequate growth hormone secretion, excessive appetite and associated obesity, impaired body temperature regulation, and hypothyroidism. The syndrome is also related to an increased risk of central adrenal insufficiency, although its prevalence remains unknown. The results of the studies in which different methods of pharmacological stimulation were used do not provide conclusive outcomes. As a result, there are no clear guidelines with regard to diagnosis, prevention, or long-term care when adrenal insufficiency is suspected in patients with PWS. Currently, most patients with PWS are treated with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). It has been confirmed that rhGH therapy has a positive effect on growth, body composition, body mass index (BMI), and potentially on psychomotor development in children with PWS. Additionally, rhGH may reduce the conversion of cortisone to cortisol through inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. However, its influence on basal adrenal function and adrenal stress response remains unexplained in children with PWS. This paper reviews the literature related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction in the PWS patient population with a focus on children.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge on heat stress of animals is key to developing management strategies to mitigate its effects on livestock production. Efficiency and profitability of production systems will certainly be challenged by the forecasted global temperature increase of 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2050. Goats are a resilient animal model, much less affected by climatic variations than average livestock. However, this statement is only true to a certain threshold, which, if exceeded, may affect energy metabolism of goats thus affecting respiratory frequency, heart pulse, evaporative thermolysis and rectal temperature, also altering on hormonal profile of animals, leading to behavioural changes such as altering feed and water intake and sheltering in the quest for homeothermic status. Dairy goat breeds, such as Saanen, are more sensitive to heat stress. Adaptations in nutritional and environmental management, as well as selecting better adapted breeds are strategic practices targeting the mitigation of effects of thermal stress of goats in farming systems. However, studies on effects of ambient temperature on energy and basal metabolisms of goats are scarce. This review aims to elucidate energetic and basal metabolism responses of goats under heat stress targeting the development of management strategies to mitigate heat stress in the farming systems and the conservation of genetic resources, adaptability, phenotypic plasticity, and basal heat production in different breeds.",

      "abstract": "Ovulation is critical for both conception and overall health, but many people who may ovulate are not tracking ovulation or any other part of their menstrual cycle. Failure to track ovulation, especially in those trying to conceive, can lead to fertility challenges due to absent ovulation, mistiming intercourse, or an undetected luteal phase defect. Ovulatory disorders and mistiming intercourse are both primary causes of infertility, and tracking ovulation is shown to decrease the average time to conception. While there are many tracking methods and apps available, the majority are predictive apps or ovulation predictor kits and do not test or track both successful ovulation and the health of the luteal phase, leading to missing information that could contribute to diagnosis or successful conception. Here, we review why ovulation tracking and a healthy luteal phase are important for those trying to conceive. We present currently available ovulation tracking methods that detect both ovulation and the luteal phase, including cervical mucus, urinary hormone testing, and basal body temperature, and discuss the use, advantages, and disadvantages of each. Finally, we consider the role of digital applications and tracking technologies in ovulation tracking.",

      "abstract": "Several methods are routinely used to measure avian body temperature, but different methods vary in invasiveness. This may cause stress-induced increases in temperature and/or metabolic rate and, hence, overestimation of both parameters. Choosing an adequate temperature measurement method is therefore key to accurately characterizing an animal's thermal and metabolic phenotype. Using great tits (Parus major) and four common methods with different levels of invasiveness (intraperitoneal, cloacal, subcutaneous, cutaneous), we evaluated the preciseness of body temperature measurements and effects on resting metabolic rate (RMR) over a 40°C range of ambient temperatures. None of the methods caused overestimation or underestimation of RMR compared with un-instrumented birds, and body or skin temperature estimates did not differ between methods in thermoneutrality. However, skin temperature was lower compared with all other methods below thermoneutrality. These results provide empirical guidance for future research that aims to measure body temperature and metabolic rate in small bird models.",

      "title": "Incubation temperature and physiological aging in the zebra finch.",
      "abstract": "In birds, incubation temperature has received increased attention as an important source of phenotypic variability in offspring. A lower than optimal incubation temperature may negatively affect aspects of nestling physiology, such as body growth and energy metabolism. However, the long-term effects of sub-optimal incubation temperature on morphology and physiology are not well understood. In a previous study, we showed that zebra finches from eggs incubated at a low temperature (35.9°C) for 2/3 of the total incubation time suffered a lower post-fledging survival compared to individuals that had been incubated at higher temperatures (37.0 and 37.9°C). In the present study, we investigated whether these variations in incubation temperature could cause permanent long-lasting differences in body mass, body size, or basal metabolic rate. Furthermore, we tested whether the observed differences in survival between treatment groups would be reflected in the rate of physiological deterioration, assessed through oxidative damage and decreased metabolic rate with age (i.e. 'metabolic aging'). Incubation temperature did not significantly affect embryonic or nestling body growth and did not influence final adult body mass or body size. Nor was there any long-term effect on basal metabolic rate. Birds from eggs incubated at the lowest temperature experienced an accumulation of oxidative damage with age, although this was not accompanied by an accelerated rate of metabolic aging. The present results suggest that the low survival in these birds was possibly mediated by increased oxidative stress, but independent of body growth and the basal metabolic rate.",

      "abstract": "Long-term acclimation temperature effects on biomarkers of oxidative stress, metabolic stress, expression of heat shock proteins (Hsps), and warm-temperature acclimation related 65-kDa protein (Wap65) were evaluated in the threatened chocolate mahseer (Neolissochilus hexagonolepis). Fifteen-day-old larvae were acclimated to different water temperatures (15, 19, 23-control group, 27, and 31 °C) for 60 days prior to the sampling for quantification of mRNA, enzyme, nitric oxide, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Acclimation to 31 °C increased the basal mRNA level of glutathione S-transferase alpha 1 (GSTa1), and activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), and GST enzymes and but downregulated the expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the whole-body homogenate. Other antioxidant genes, i.e., CAT and GPx1a, were unaffected at 31 °C, and nitric oxide (NO) concentration was significantly lower. In contrast, fish acclimated to 15 °C showed an upregulated transcript level of all the antioxidant genes and no significant difference in the CAT, GR, and GST enzymes. Activities of the metabolic enzymes, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), were significantly lower at 15 °C. The expression of Hsp47 was upregulated at both 15 and 31 °C groups, whereas Hsp70 was elevated at 27 and 31 °C groups. Wap65-1 transcription did not show significant variation in treatment groups compared to control. Fish in the high (31 °C) and low-temperature (15 °C) acclimation groups were capable of maintaining oxidative stress by modulating their antioxidant transcripts, enzymes, and Hsps.",

      "title": "Sulfide metabolism and the mechanism of torpor.",
      "abstract": "Hibernation is a powerful response of a number of mammalian species to reduce energy during the cold winter season, when food is scarce. Mammalian hibernators survive winter by spending most of the time in a state of torpor, where basal metabolic rate is strongly suppressed and body temperature comes closer to ambient temperature. These torpor bouts are regularly interrupted by short arousals, where metabolic rate and body temperature spontaneously return to normal levels. The mechanisms underlying these changes, and in particular the strong metabolic suppression of torpor, have long remained elusive. As summarized in this Commentary, increasing evidence points to a potential key role for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the suppression of mitochondrial respiration during torpor. The idea that H2S could be involved in hibernation originated in some early studies, where exogenous H2S gas was found to induce a torpor-like state in mice, and despite some controversy, the idea persisted. H2S is a widespread signaling molecule capable of inhibiting mitochondrial respiration in vitro and studies found significant in vivo changes in endogenous H2S metabolites associated with hibernation or torpor. Along with increased expression of H2S-synthesizing enzymes during torpor, H2S degradation catalyzed by the mitochondrial sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) appears to have a key role in controlling H2S availability for inhibiting respiration. Specifically, in thirteen-lined squirrels, SQR is highly expressed and inhibited in torpor, possibly by acetylation, thereby limiting H2S oxidation and causing inhibition of respiration. H2S may also control other aspects associated with hibernation, such as synthesis of antioxidant enzymes and of SQR itself.",

There is however no study reporting heart and respiratory rate, blood pressure and body temperature simultaneously recorded in the same animal in association to different forms of immobility in response to threat: freezing, restraint-sustained immobility and tonic immobility (TI). In a prey/ predator context freezing behavior is associated with bradycardia and no change in blood pressure but in other conditions (e.g., extreme stressful stimuli) may be associated with tachycardia and hypertension. Restraint-sustained immobility does not affect blood pressure but may reduce heart rate according to the type of stimulus and mechanical pressure. Blood pressure and heart rate oscillate during TI induction and adjust at basal levels during TI, sometimes gradually decreasing below basal levels. In conclusion, in all these passive defense responses, the immobility is not due to a blood pressure collapse.",

The majority of these utilize measurements of basal body temperature or combinations of various urinary hormones. This clinical opinion characterizes the scant available research validating the accuracy of these technologies. It further examines research oversight, discusses the utility of these wearables and devices to consumers, and considers these technologies through an equity lens. The discussion concludes with a call for innovation, describing promising new technologies that not only harness unique physiologic parameters to predict ovulation, but also focus on cost-effectiveness with the hope of increasing access to these currently costly devices and wearables.",

The results showed a strong negative correlation between the sleep midpoint and the quasi-peak value (an indicator of rhythm robustness), and a positive correlation between the length of the menstrual cycle (days) and social jetlag (hours). These results suggest that healthy women with late sleeping habits have a disturbed sleep-wake rhythm and that irregular habits prolong the menstrual cycle. The sleep midpoint and quasi-peak values showed variations during the menstrual cycle. The quasi-peak values in the follicular phase were significantly higher than those in the menstrual and luteal phases. In rodents, the phase of locomotor activity rhythm advances, and activity increases at night during proestrus. The increase in quasi-peak values during the follicular phase, when estrogen is relatively high, may be due to the increased activity caused by estrogen. These results suggest that ovarian steroid hormones influence sleep-wake rhythms in women. Verifying the results of this study under various conditions is necessary; however, accurately predicting the day of ovulation using only the acquisition of sleep-wake rhythms with wearable devices will be possible.",

      "abstract": "Ambient/room temperature settings in burn treatment areas vary greatly due to a lack of evidence-based guidelines to direct care. While it is generally understood that ambient/room temperature impacts patient body temperature and metabolism, the ideal settings for optimizing patient outcomes are unclear. The literature assessing this topic is scarce, with many of the articles having significant limitations. We aim to summarize the current evidence for ambient/room temperature control, to address gaps in current reviews addressing this topic, and to elucidate topics requiring further research. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were queried for studies which evaluated the effect of the ambient/room temperature on burn patient core body temperature, patient metabolism, and outcomes among those treated in trauma bays, burn ICUs, and operating rooms. Although existing literature lacks sufficient patient outcome data regarding specific ambient/room temperatures, we highlight physiological processes that are impacted by changes in room temperatures in an effort to describe strategies that can allow for improved patient core body temperature control and outcomes in burn care settings.",

      "title": "Gut microbiome and health: mechanistic insights.",
      "abstract": "The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected.In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5).Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.",

      "title": "What defines a healthy gut microbiome?",
      "abstract": "The understanding that changes in microbiome composition can influence chronic human diseases and the efficiency of therapies has driven efforts to develop microbiota-centred therapies such as first and next generation probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics, microbiota editing and faecal microbiota transplantation. Central to microbiome research is understanding how disease impacts microbiome composition and vice versa, yet there is a problematic issue with the term 'dysbiosis', which broadly links microbial imbalances to various chronic illnesses without precision or definition. Another significant issue in microbiome discussions is defining 'healthy individuals' to ascertain what characterises a healthy microbiome. This involves questioning who represents the healthiest segment of our population-whether it is those free from illnesses, athletes at peak performance, individuals living healthily through regular exercise and good nutrition or even elderly adults or centenarians who have been tested by time and achieved remarkable healthy longevity.This review advocates for delineating 'what defines a healthy microbiome?' by considering a broader range of factors related to human health and environmental influences on the microbiota. A healthy microbiome is undoubtedly linked to gut health. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to pinpoint a universally accepted definition of 'gut health' due to the complexities of measuring gut functionality besides the microbiota composition. We must take into account individual variabilities, the influence of diet, lifestyle, host and environmental factors. Moreover, the challenge in distinguishing causation from correlation between gut microbiome and overall health is presented.The review also highlights the resource-heavy nature of comprehensive gut health assessments, which hinders their practicality and broad application. Finally, we call for continued research and a nuanced approach to better understand the intricate and evolving concept of gut health, emphasising the need for more precise and inclusive definitions and methodologies in studying the microbiome.",

The gut microbiota is a crucial actor that can interact with the host by the production of a diverse reservoir of metabolites, from exogenous dietary substrates or endogenous host compounds. Metabolic disorders are associated with alterations in the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Specific classes of microbiota-derived metabolites, notably bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, trimethylamine N-oxide, tryptophan and indole derivatives, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders.

Recent studies have highlighted the bidirectional impacts between host genetics/epigenetics and the gut microbial community. Host genetics influence the composition of gut microbiome, while the gut microbiota and their derived metabolites can induce host epigenetic modifications to affect the development of MASLD. The exploration of the intricate relationship between the gut microbiome and the genetic/epigenetic makeup of the host is anticipated to yield promising avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting MASLD and its associated conditions. In this review, we summarise the effects of gut microbiome, host genetics and epigenetic alterations in MASLD and MASLD-HCC. We further discuss research findings demonstrating the bidirectional impacts between gut microbiome and host genetics/epigenetics, emphasising the significance of this interconnection in MASLD prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune liver diseases are chronic inflammatory hepatobiliary disorders that when classically defined encompass three distinctive clinical presentations; primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Meaningful changes in disease epidemiology are reported, with increasing incidence and prevalence of AIH and PSC in Europe, and rising prevalence of PBC across Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region. However, there appears to be very significant global variation with contemporary incidence rates of disease per 100 000 ranging from 0.84 to 2.75 for PBC, 0.1 to 4.39 for PSC and 0.4 to 2.39 for AIH. Prevalence corresponds, and per 100 000 estimates for PBC range from 1.91 to 40.2, for PSC between 0.78 and 31.7 and for AIH from 4.8 to 42.9. Population-based studies and multicentre observational cohort series provide improved understanding of the clinical course that patients experience, highlighting variations in presenting phenotypes geographically and temporally. Collectively, while autoimmune liver diseases are rare, the clinical burden is disproportionately high relative to population incidence and prevalence. Age, sex and race also impact clinical outcomes, and patient morbidity and mortality are reflected by high need for gastroenterology, hepatology and organ transplant services.",

Both population-wide and small-scale studies have identified transit time as a top covariate contributing to the large interindividual variation in the faecal microbiota composition. Despite this, transit time is still rarely being considered in the field of the human gut microbiome. Here, we review the latest research describing how and why whole gut and segmental transit times vary substantially between and within individuals, and how variations in gut transit time impact the gut microbiota composition, diversity and metabolism. Furthermore, we discuss the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota may causally affect gut motility. We argue that by taking into account the interindividual and intraindividual differences in gut transit time, we can advance our understanding of diet-microbiota interactions and disease-related microbiome signatures, since these may often be confounded by transient or persistent alterations in transit time. Altogether, a better understanding of the complex, bidirectional interactions between the gut microbiota and transit time is required to better understand gut microbiome variations in health and disease.",

The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the evidence that guides clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007. These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and comprise systematic reviews in the key areas, including the diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis are available, these have been updated with additional studies. In addition, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included. Where possible, judgement has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines and the specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practising clinicians, and it is expected that these guidelines will be revised in 3 years' time.",

This paper reports the conclusions of the RE.GA.IN. consensus process, which culminated in Venice in November 2022 after more than 8 months of intense global scientific deliberations. A forum of gastritis scholars from five continents participated in the multidisciplinary RE.GA.IN. consensus. After lively debates on the most controversial aspects of the gastritis spectrum, the RE.GA.IN.

      "abstract": "Despite the promising advances in novel cancer therapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), limitations including therapeutic resistance and toxicity remain. In recent years, the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has been extensively studied. Accumulating evidence reveals the role of microbiota in defining cancer therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Unlike host genetics, microbiota can be easily modified via multiple strategies, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics and antibiotics. Preclinical studies have identified the mechanisms on how microbes influence cancer treatment outcomes. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential of microbiota modulation in cancer treatments. Herein, we review the mechanistic insights of gut microbial interactions with chemotherapy and ICIs, particularly focusing on the interplay between gut bacteria and the pharmacokinetics (eg, metabolism, enzymatic degradation) or pharmacodynamics (eg, immunomodulation) of cancer treatment. The translational potential of basic findings in clinical settings is then explored, including using microbes as predictive biomarkers and microbial modulation by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulations and FMT. We further discuss the current limitations of gut microbiota modulation in patients with cancer and suggest essential directions for future study. In the era of personalised medicine, it is crucial to understand the microbiota and its interactions with cancer. Manipulating the gut microbiota to augment cancer therapeutic responses can provide new insights into cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiome is an important regulator of body weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, and inflammatory processes, and may thereby play a key role in the aetiology of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Interindividual responsiveness to specific dietary interventions may be partially determined by differences in baseline gut microbiota composition and functionality between individuals with distinct metabolic phenotypes. However, the relationship between an individual's diet, gut microbiome and host metabolic phenotype is multidirectional and complex, yielding a challenge for practical implementation of targeted dietary guidelines. In this review, we discuss the latest research describing interactions between dietary composition, the gut microbiome and host metabolism. Furthermore, we describe how this knowledge can be integrated to develop precision-based nutritional strategies to improve bodyweight control and metabolic health in humans. Specifically, we will address that (1) insight in the role of the baseline gut microbial and metabolic phenotype in dietary intervention response may provide leads for precision-based nutritional strategies; that (2) the balance between carbohydrate and protein fermentation by the gut microbiota, as well as the site of fermentation in the colon, seems important determinants of host metabolism; and that (3) 'big data', including multiple omics and advanced modelling, are of undeniable importance in predicting (non-)response to dietary interventions. Clearly, detailed metabolic and microbial phenotyping in humans is necessary to better understand the link between diet, the gut microbiome and host metabolism, which is required to develop targeted dietary strategies and guidelines for different subgroups of the population.",

      "abstract": "The diet and gut microbiota have been extensively interrogated as a fuel for gut inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in the last few years. Here, we review how specific nutrients, typically enriched in a Western diet, instigate or deteriorate experimental gut inflammation in a genetically susceptible host and we discuss microbiota-dependent and independent mechanisms. We depict the study landscape of nutritional trials in paediatric and adult IBD and delineate common grounds for dietary advice. Conclusively, the diet reflects a critical rheostat of microbial dysbiosis and gut inflammation in IBD. Dietary restriction by exclusive enteral nutrition, with or without a specific exclusion diet, is effectively treating paediatric Crohn's disease, while adult IBD trials are less conclusive. Insights into molecular mechanisms of nutritional therapy will change the perception of IBD and will allow us to enter the era of precision nutrition. To achieve this, we discuss the need for carefully designed nutritional trials with scientific rigour comparable to medical trials, which also requires action from stake holders. Establishing evidence-based dietary therapy for IBD does not only hold promise to avoid long-term immunosuppression, but to provide a widely accessible therapy at low cost. Identification of dietary culprits disturbing gut health also bears the potential to prevent IBD and allows informed decision making in food politics.",

      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders-recently renamed into disorders of gut-brain interaction-such as irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia are highly prevalent conditions with bothersome abdominal symptoms in the absence of structural abnormalities. While traditionally considered as motility disorders or even psychosomatic conditions, our understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved significantly over the last two decades. Initial observations of subtle mucosal infiltration with immune cells, especially mast cells and eosinophils, are since recently being backed up by mechanistic evidence demonstrating increased release of nociceptive mediators by immune cells and the intestinal epithelium. These mediators can activate sensitised neurons leading to visceral hypersensitivity with bothersome symptoms. The interaction between immune activation and an impaired barrier function of the gut is most likely a bidirectional one with alterations in the microbiota, psychological stress and food components as upstream players in the pathophysiology. Only few immune-targeting treatments are currently available, but an improved understanding through a multidisciplinary scientific approach will hopefully identify novel, more precise treatment targets with ultimately better outcomes.",

They have long been considered a difficult to treat entity due to limited therapy options, but the increasing use of anti-tumour necrosis factors has dramatically changed the therapeutic approach to EIM in recent years. Newly emerging therapies such as JAK inhibitors and anti-interleukin 12/23 will further shape the available armamentarium. Clinicians dealing with EIMs in everyday IBD practice may be puzzled by the numerous available biological agents and small molecules, their efficacy for EIMs and their potential off-label indications. Current guidelines on EIMs in IBD do not include treatment algorithms to help practitioners in the treatment decision-making process. Herein, we summarise knowledge on emerging biological treatment options and small molecules for EIMs, highlight current research gaps, provide therapeutic algorithms for EIM management and shed light on future strategies in the context of IBD-related EIMs.",

      "title": "Gut microbiome stability and resilience: elucidating the response to perturbations in order to modulate gut health.",
      "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, densely colonised by thousands of microbial species. It varies among individuals and depends on host genotype and environmental factors, such as diet and antibiotics. In this review, we focus on stability and resilience as essential ecological characteristics of the gut microbiome and its relevance for human health. Microbial diversity, metabolic flexibility, functional redundancy, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions seem to be critical for maintaining resilience. The equilibrium of the gut ecosystem can be disrupted by perturbations, such as antibiotic therapy, causing significant decreases in functional richness and microbial diversity as well as impacting metabolic health. As a consequence, unbalanced states or even unhealthy stable states can develop, potentially leading to or supporting diseases. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to manipulate the gut microbiome in order to prevent or revert unhealthy states caused by perturbations, including faecal microbiota transplantation, supplementation with probiotics or non-digestible carbohydrates, and more extensive dietary modifications. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies has evidenced interindividual variability in extent and direction of response to diet and perturbations, which has been attributed to the unique characteristics of each individual's microbiome. From a clinical, translational perspective, the ability to improve resilience of the gut microbial ecosystem prior to perturbations, or to restore its equilibrium afterwards, would offer significant benefits. To be effective, this therapeutic approach will likely need a personalised or subgroup-based understanding of individual genetics, diet, gut microbiome and other environmental factors that might be involved.",

      "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction, affecting approximately 7% of individuals in the community, with most patients managed in primary care. The last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline for the management of dyspepsia was published in 1996. In the interim, substantial advances have been made in understanding the complex pathophysiology of FD, and there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning its diagnosis and classification, with the advent of the Rome IV criteria, and management. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based diagnosis and treatment of patients. The approach to investigating the patient presenting with dyspepsia is discussed, and efficacy of drugs in FD summarised based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of pairwise and network meta-analyses. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. These provide both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, in this guideline, we consider novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need and priorities for future research.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota has been implicated in cancer and shown to modulate anticancer drug efficacy. Altered gut microbiota is associated with resistance to chemo drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), whereas supplementation of distinct bacterial species restores responses to the anticancer drugs. Accumulating evidence has revealed the potential of modulating the gut microbiota to enhance the efficacy of anticancer drugs. Regardless of the valuable findings by preclinical models and clinical data of patients with cancer, a more thorough understanding of the interactions of the microbiota with cancer therapy helps researchers identify novel strategy for cancer prevention, stratify patients for more effective treatment and reduce treatment complication. In this review, we discuss the scientific evidence on the role of gut microbiota in cancer treatment, and highlight the latest knowledge and technologies leveraged to target specific bacteria that contribute to tumourigenesis. First, we provide an overview of the role of the gut microbiota in cancer, establishing the links between bacteria, inflammation and cancer treatment. Second, we highlight the mechanisms used by distinct bacterial species to modulate cancer growth, immune responses, as well as the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and ICIs. Third, we demonstrate various approaches to modulate the gut microbiota and their potential in translational research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current microbiome research in the context of cancer treatment, ongoing efforts to overcome these challenges and future perspectives.",

The composition of functions of the gut microbiome in the prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal period may be crucial towards development of health or disease, including IBD, later in life. We herein present a comprehensive summary of the interplay between early-life factors and microbiome perturbations, and their association with risk of IBD. In addition, we provide an overview of host and external factors in early life that are known to impact gut microbiome maturation and exposures implicated in IBD risk. Considering the emerging concept of IBD prevention, we propose strategies to minimise maternal and offspring exposure to potentially harmful variables and recommend protective measures during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This holistic view of early-life factors and microbiome signatures among mothers and their offspring will help frame our current understanding of their importance towards IBD pathogenesis and frame the roadmap for preventive strategies.",

      "abstract": "TNF-like cytokine 1A (TL1A) and its functional receptor, death-domain receptor 3 (DR3), are members of the TNF and TNFR superfamilies, respectively, with recognised roles in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses; additional existence of a decoy receptor, DcR3, indicates a tightly regulated cytokine system. The significance of TL1A:DR3 signalling in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by several converging lines of evidence. Herein, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of what is currently known regarding the TL1A/DR3 system in the context of IBD. TL1A and DR3 are expressed by cellular subsets with important roles for the initiation and maintenance of intestinal inflammation, serving as potent universal costimulators of effector immune responses, indicating their participation in the pathogenesis of IBD. Recent evidence also supports a homoeostatic role for TL1A:DR3 via regulation of Tregs and innate lymphoid cells. TL1A and DR3 are also expressed by stromal cells and may contribute to inflammation-induced or inflammation-independent intestinal fibrogenesis. Finally, discovery of genetic polymorphisms with functional consequences may allow for patient stratification, including differential responses to TL1A-targeted therapeutics. In conclusion, TL1A:DR3 signalling plays a central and multifaceted role in the immunological pathways that underlie intestinal inflammation, such as that observed in IBD. Such evidence provides the foundation for developing pharmaceutical approaches targeting this ligand-receptor pair in IBD.",

      "abstract": "We are entering an era of medicine where increasingly sophisticated data will be obtained from patients to determine proper diagnosis, predict outcomes and direct therapies. We predict that the most valuable data will be produced by systems that are highly dynamic in both time and space. Three-dimensional (3D) organoids are poised to be such a highly valuable system for a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. In the lab, organoids have emerged as powerful systems to model molecular and cellular processes orchestrating natural and pathophysiological human tissue formation in remarkable detail. Preclinical studies have impressively demonstrated that these organs-in-a-dish can be used to model immunological, neoplastic, metabolic or infectious GI disorders by taking advantage of patient-derived material. Technological breakthroughs now allow to study cellular communication and molecular mechanisms of interorgan cross-talk in health and disease including communication along for example, the gut-brain axis or gut-liver axis. Despite considerable success in culturing classical 3D organoids from various parts of the GI tract, some challenges remain to develop these systems to best help patients. Novel platforms such as organ-on-a-chip, engineered biomimetic systems including engineered organoids, micromanufacturing, bioprinting and enhanced rigour and reproducibility will open improved avenues for tissue engineering, as well as regenerative and personalised medicine. This review will highlight some of the established methods and also some exciting novel perspectives on organoids in the fields of gastroenterology. At present, this field is poised to move forward and impact many currently intractable GI diseases in the form of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.",

      "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to specific mRNA targets and promoting their degradation and/or translational inhibition. miRNAs regulate both physiological and pathological liver functions. Altered expression of miRNAs is associated with liver metabolism dysregulation, liver injury, liver fibrosis and tumour development, making miRNAs attractive therapeutic strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases. Here, we review recent advances regarding the regulation and function of miRNAs in liver diseases with a major focus on miRNAs that are specifically expressed or enriched in hepatocytes (miR-122, miR-194/192), neutrophils (miR-223), hepatic stellate cells (miR-29), immune cells (miR-155) and in circulation (miR-21). The functions and target genes of these miRNAs are emphasised in alcohol-associated liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma, as well liver fibrosis and liver failure. We touch on the roles of miRNAs in intercellular communication between hepatocytes and other types of cells via extracellular vesicles in the pathogenesis of liver diseases. We provide perspective on the application of miRNAs as biomarkers for early diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of liver diseases and discuss the challenges in miRNA-based therapy for liver diseases. Further investigation of miRNAs in the liver will help us better understand the pathogeneses of liver diseases and may identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets for liver diseases in the future.",

In gastroenterology and hepatology, studies have explored a myriad of opportunities for AI/ML applications which are already making the transition to bedside. Despite these advances, there is a risk that biases and health inequities can be introduced or exacerbated by these technologies. If unrecognised, these technologies could generate or worsen systematic racial, ethnic and sex disparities when deployed on a large scale. There are several mechanisms through which AI/ML could contribute to health inequities in gastroenterology and hepatology, including diagnosis of oesophageal cancer, management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), liver transplantation, colorectal cancer screening and many others. This review adapts a framework for ethical AI/ML development and application to gastroenterology and hepatology such that clinical practice is advanced while minimising bias and optimising health equity.",

      "title": "British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of iron deficiency anaemia in adults.",
      "abstract": "Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a major cause of morbidity and burden of disease worldwide. It can generally be diagnosed by blood testing and remedied by iron replacement therapy (IRT) using the oral or intravenous route. The many causes of iron deficiency include poor dietary intake and malabsorption of dietary iron, as well as a number of significant gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Because blood is iron-rich it can result from chronic blood loss, and this is a common mechanism underlying the development of IDA-for example, as a consequence of menstrual or GI blood loss.Approximately a third of men and postmenopausal women presenting with IDA have an underlying pathological abnormality, most commonly in the GI tract. Therefore optimal management of IDA requires IRT in combination with appropriate investigation to establish the underlying cause. Unexplained IDA in all at-risk individuals is an accepted indication for fast-track secondary care referral in the UK because GI malignancies can present in this way, often in the absence of specific symptoms. Bidirectional GI endoscopy is the standard diagnostic approach to examination of the upper and lower GI tract, though radiological scanning is an alternative in some situations for assessing the large bowel. In recurrent or refractory IDA, wireless capsule endoscopy plays an important role in assessment of the small bowel.IDA may present in primary care or across a range of specialties in secondary care, and because of this and the insidious nature of the condition it has not always been optimally managed despite the considerable burden of disease- with investigation sometimes being inappropriate, incorrectly timed or incomplete, and the role of IRT for symptom relief neglected. It is therefore important that contemporary guidelines for the management of IDA are available to all clinicians. This document is a revision of previous British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines, updated in the light of subsequent evidence and developments.",

      "title": "Postprandial symptoms in disorders of gut-brain interaction and their potential as a treatment target.",
      "abstract": "Postprandial, or meal-related, symptoms, such as abdominal pain, early satiation, fullness or bloating, are often reported by patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction, including functional dyspepsia (FD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We propose that postprandial symptoms arise via a distinct pathophysiological process. A physiological or psychological insult, for example, acute enteric infection, leads to loss of tolerance to a previously tolerated oral food antigen. This enables interaction of both the microbiota and the food antigen itself with the immune system, causing a localised immunological response, with activation of eosinophils and mast cells, and release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine and cytokines. These have more widespread systemic effects, including triggering nociceptive nerves and altering mood. Dietary interventions, including a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, elimination of potential food antigens or gluten, IgG food sensitivity diets or salicylate restriction may benefit some patients with IBS or FD. This could be because the restriction of these foods or dietary components modulates this pathophysiological process. Similarly, drugs including proton pump inhibitors, histamine-receptor antagonists, mast cell stabilisers or even tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, which have anti-histaminergic actions, all of which are potential treatments for FD and IBS, act on one or more of these mechanisms. It seems unlikely that food antigens driving intestinal immune activation are the entire explanation for postprandial symptoms in FD and IBS. In others, fermentation of intestinal carbohydrates, with gas release altering reflex responses, adverse reactions to food chemicals, central mechanisms or nocebo effects may dominate. However, if the concept that postprandial symptoms arise from food antigens driving an immune response in the gastrointestinal tract in a subset of patients is correct, it is paradigm-shifting, because if the choice of treatment were based on one or more of these therapeutic targets, patient outcomes may be improved.",

      "abstract": "Over 2.5 million gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) every year. Procedures are carried out with local anaesthetic r with sedation. Sedation is commonly used for gastrointestinal endoscopy, but the type and amount of sedation administered is influenced by the complexity and nature of the procedure and patient factors. The elective and emergency nature of endoscopy procedures and local resources also have a significant impact on the delivery of sedation. In the UK, the vast majority of sedated procedures are carried out using benzodiazepines, with or without opiates, whereas deeper sedation using propofol or general anaesthetic requires the involvement of an anaesthetic team. Patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy need to have good understanding of the options for sedation, including the option for no sedation and alternatives, balancing the intended aims of the procedure and reducing the risk of complications. These guidelines were commissioned by the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Endoscopy Committee with input from major stakeholders, to provide a detailed update, incorporating recent advances in sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy.This guideline covers aspects from pre-assessment of the elective 'well' patient to patients with significant comorbidity requiring emergency procedures. Types of sedation are discussed, procedure and room requirements and the recovery period, providing guidance to enhance safety and minimise complications. These guidelines are intended to inform practising clinicians and all staff involved in the delivery of gastrointestinal endoscopy with an expectation that this guideline will be revised in 5-years' time.",

      "abstract": "The role of probiotics in regulating intestinal flora to enhance host immunity has recently received widespread attention. Altering the human gut microbiota may increase the predisposition to several disease phenotypes such as gut inflammation and metabolic disorders. The intestinal microbiota converts dietary nutrients into metabolites that serve as biologically active molecules in modulating regulatory functions in the host. Probiotics, which are active microorganisms, play a versatile role in restoring the composition of the gut microbiota, helping to improve host immunity and prevent intestinal disease phenotypes. This comprehensive review provides firsthand information on the gut microbiota and their influence on human health, the dietary effects of diet on the gut microbiota, and how probiotics alter the composition and function of the human gut microbiota, along with their corresponding effects on host immunity in building a healthy intestine. We also discuss the implications of probiotics in some of the most important human diseases. In summary, probiotics play a significant role in regulating the gut microbiota, boosting overall immunity, increasing the abundance of beneficial bacteria, and helping ameliorate the symptoms of multiple diseases.",

      "abstract": "The liver is a vital metabolism and detoxification organ of human body, which is involved in the biotransformation and metabolism of the organism. Hepatitis - cirrhosis - liver cancer are significant and common part of liver diseases. The pathogenesis of liver diseases is generally as followed: inflammation and other pathogenic factors cause persistent damage to the liver, leading to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Patients with chronic hepatitis have a high risk of developing into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even life-threatening liver cancer, which poses a great threat to public health.As the first organ to come into contact with blood from the gut, the liver is profoundly affected by the intestinal flora and its metabolites, with leaky gut and flora imbalance being the triggers of the liver's pathological response. So far, no one has reviewed the role of intestinal flora in this process from the perspective of the progression of hepatitis-cirrhosis-liver cancer and this article reviews the evidence supporting the effect of intestinal flora in the progression of liver disease.",

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem involved in the metabolism, immunity, and health of the host. The microbiome plays a key role in the development of the host's innate and adaptive immune system, while the immune system orchestrates the maintenance of host-microbe symbiosis. Lung diseases are usually accompanied by dysbiosis of the intestinal flora and an immune-inflammatory response. The intestinal flora and its metabolites are directly or indirectly involved in the immune regulation of the host in lung disease. However, the exact mechanism of action of the gut-lung axis crosstalk remains unclear. This review is aimed to summarize the latest advances in gut microbiota and their metabolites in typical lung diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension, COPD, and lung cancer. Especially COVID-19, a problem troubling the world, is also discussed in it. Moreover, it is concentrated on the action mechanisms between the identified gut microbiota or their metabolites and the specific lung diseases, and on the link among the gut microbiota, its metabolites, and immune regulation, which could be used as a breakthrough to find new mechanisms and targets for some diseases without specific therapeutic drugs in clinic. It is also discussed a new therapeutic tool \"drug-bacterial interaction\" and the potential of therapeutic applications in clinic. This review would provide a clear direction for future research on gut microbiota and lung diseases, and propose a new therapeutic strategy targeting \"drug-bacterial interaction\" in clinic.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), one of the fastest growing metabolic diseases, has been characterized by metabolic disorders including hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance (IR). In recent years, T2DM has become the fastest growing metabolic disease in the world. Studies have indicated that patients with T2DM are often associated with intestinal flora disorders and dysfunction involving multiple organs. Metabolites of the intestinal flora, such as bile acids (BAs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and amino acids (AAs)may influence to some extent the decreased insulin sensitivity associated with T2DM dysfunction and regulate metabolic as well as immune homeostasis. In this paper, we review the changes in the gut flora in T2DM and the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota modulates metabolites affecting T2DM, which may provide a basis for the early identification of T2DM-susceptible individuals and guide targeted interventions. Finally, we also highlight gut microecological therapeutic strategies focused on shaping the gut flora to inform the improvement of T2DM progression.",

In recent years, intestinal flora has attracted increasing attention from scholars worldwide, and its association with ischemic stroke is becoming a hot topic of research amongst researchers in field of stroke. After suffering from a stroke, intestinal microbial dysbiosis leads to increased intestinal permeability and activation of the intestinal immune system, which in turn leads to ectopic intestinal bacteria and pro-inflammatory cells that enter brain tissue through the damaged blood-brain barrier. This exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury. Interestingly, after a stroke, some metabolites produced by the intestinal flora attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing the post-stroke inflammatory response and promotes the repair of neurological function. Here we elucidate the changes in gut flora after occurrence of a stroke and highlight the immunomodulatory processes of the post-stroke gut flora.",

      "title": "The interactions between traditional Chinese medicine and gut microbiota in cancers: Current status and future perspectives.",
      "abstract": "The gut microbiota, known as the \"forgotten organ\" and \"human second genome,\" comprises a complex microecosystem. It significantly influences the development of various tumors, including colorectal, liver, stomach, breast, and lung cancers, through both direct and indirect mechanisms. These mechanisms include the \"gut-liver\" axis, the \"lung-intestine\" axis, and interactions with the immune system. The intestinal flora exhibits dual roles in cancer, both promoting and suppressing its progression. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can alter cancer progression by regulating the intestinal flora. It modifies the intestinal flora's composition and structure, along with the levels of endogenous metabolites, thus affecting the intestinal barrier, immune system, and overall body metabolism. These actions contribute to TCM's significant antitumor effects. Moreover, the gut microbiota metabolizes TCM components, enhancing their antitumor properties. Therefore, exploring the interaction between TCM and the intestinal flora offers a novel perspective in understanding TCM's antitumor mechanisms. This paper succinctly reviews the association between gut flora and the development of tumors, including colorectal, liver, gastric, breast, and lung cancers. It further examines current research on the interaction between TCM and intestinal flora, with a focus on its antitumor efficacy. It identifies limitations in existing studies and suggests recommendations, providing insights into antitumor drug research and exploring TCM's antitumor effectiveness. Additionally, this paper aims to guide future research on TCM and the gut microbiota in antitumor studies.",

      "abstract": "Currently, there are many drugs available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but most of them cause various side effects due to the need for long-term use. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Gegen Qinlian Decoction (GQD) has shown good efficacy and low side effects in the treatment of T2DM in both clinical and basic research. Based on relevant traditional Chinese medicine theories, dried ginger is innovatively added the formula of traditional GQD to create a modified GQD. This modification reduces the side effects of traditional GQD while exerting its therapeutic effect on T2DM. Previous studies have found that the modified GQD can regulate endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver, inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis, protect pancreatic islet β cells, and control blood sugar levels by inhibiting the FXR/neuronal ceramide signaling pathway. GQD can also regulate the intestinal microbiota to achieve therapeutic and protective effects in various gastrointestinal diseases. However, there is no research exploring whether the modified GQD achieves its therapeutic mechanism for T2DM by regulating the intestinal microbiota.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a chronic and debilitating disease, associated with a high risk of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite significant advancements in improving outcomes, the lack of effective treatments underscore the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. The brain-gut axis has emerged as a crucial bidirectional pathway connecting the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) system through an intricate network of neuronal, hormonal, and immunological pathways. Four main pathways are primarily implicated in this crosstalk, including the systemic immune system, autonomic and enteric nervous systems, neuroendocrine system, and microbiome. TBI induces profound changes in the gut, initiating an unrestrained vicious cycle that exacerbates brain injury through the brain-gut axis. Alterations in the gut include mucosal damage associated with the malabsorption of nutrients/electrolytes, disintegration of the intestinal barrier, increased infiltration of systemic immune cells, dysmotility, dysbiosis, enteroendocrine cell (EEC) dysfunction and disruption in the enteric nervous system (ENS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS). Collectively, these changes further contribute to brain neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via the gut-brain axis. In this review article, we elucidate the roles of various anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapies capable of attenuating the dysregulated inflammatory response along the brain-gut axis in TBI. These agents include hormones such as serotonin, ghrelin, and progesterone, ANS regulators such as beta-blockers, lipid-lowering drugs like statins, and intestinal flora modulators such as probiotics and antibiotics. They attenuate neuroinflammation by targeting distinct inflammatory pathways in both the brain and the gut post-TBI. These therapeutic agents exhibit promising potential in mitigating inflammation along the brain-gut axis and enhancing neurocognitive outcomes for TBI patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. It is usually accompanied by motor and non-motor symptoms that seriously threaten the health and the quality of life. Novel medications are urgently needed because current pharmaceuticals can relieve symptoms but cannot stop disease progression. The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is closely associated with the occurrence and development of PD and is an effective therapeutic target. Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) can modulate the microbiome and immune regulation. However, such nucleic acid nanostructures are very sensitive to acids which hinder this promising approach. Therefore, we prepared exosome-like nanovesicles (Exo@tac) from ginger that are acid resistant and equipped with tFNAs modified by antimicrobial peptides (AMP). We verified that Exo@tac regulates intestinal bacteria associated with the microbial-gut-brain axis in vitro and significantly improves PD symptoms in vivo when administered orally. Microbiota profiling confirmed that Exo@tac normalizes the intestinal flora composition of mouse models of PD. Our findings present a novel strategy for the development of PD drugs and the innovative delivery of nucleic acid nanomedicines.",

      "abstract": "In patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), intestinal flora imbalance and butyrate metabolism disorders precede clinical arthritis and are associated with the pathogenesis of RA. This imbalance can alter the immunology and intestinal permeability of the intestinal mucosa, leading to damage to the intestinal barrier. In this context, bacteria and their metabolites can enter the bloodstream and reach the distant target tissues of the host, resulting in local inflammation and aggravating arthritis. Additionally, arthritis is also exacerbated by bone destruction and immune tolerance due to disturbed differentiation of osteoclasts and adaptive immune cells. Of note, butyrate is a metabolite of intestinal flora, which not only locally inhibits intestinal immunity and targets zonulin and tight junction proteins to alleviate intestinal barrier-mediated arthritis but also inhibits osteoclasts and autoantibodies and balances the immune responses of T and B lymphocytes throughout the body to repress bone erosion and inflammation. Therefore, butyrate is a key intermediate linking intestinal flora to the host. As a result, restoring the butyrate-producing capacity of intestinal flora and using exogenous butyrate are potential therapeutic strategies for RA in the future.",

      "abstract": "The human intestinal flora is a highly diverse ecosystem composed of trillions of bacteria. The imbalance of the flora is related to a variety of diseases. The intestinal flora interacts with the nervous system bidirectionally in many ways through the gut-brain axis. It causes neuroimmune inflammatory response, dysfunction of gut mucosa and blood-brain barrier, direct stimulation of the vagus nerve, spinal nerve of the enteric nervous system, and the neuroendocrine hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, causing neurological disorders. The metabolites of the intestinal microbial community also play a role. This article summarizes the characteristics of the altered intestinal flora and intervention measures in autism spectrum disorder, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, neuromyelitis optica, hepatic encephalopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, Huntington's disease and stroke. The current research on intestinal flora is still in its infancy, and very few studies were carried out on causality and the underlying mechanisms, which prevents the development of precise flora-based clinical intervention measures. It is expected the research on intestinal flora would lead to novel approaches for treatment of some neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic cholestasis, a persistent inflammation of the bile ducts that leads to sclerotic occlusion and cholestasis. Gut microbes, consisting of microorganisms colonized in the human gut, play an important role in nutrient intake, metabolic homeostasis, immune regulation, and immune regulation; however, their presence might aid PSC development. Studies have found that gut-liver axis interactions also play an important role in the pathogenesis of PSC. Patients with PSC have considerably reduced intestinal flora diversity and increased abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora leads to increased intestinal permeability, homing of intestinal lymphocytes, entry of bacteria and their associated metabolites, such as bile acids, into the liver, stimulation of hepatic immune activation, and promotion of PSC. Currently, PSC effective treatment is lacking. However, a number of studies have recently investigated the targeted modulation of gut microbes for the treatment of various liver diseases (alcoholic liver disease, metabolic fatty liver, cirrhosis, and autoimmune liver disease). In addition, antibiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, and probiotics have been reported as successful PSC therapies as well as for the treatment of gut dysbiosis, suggesting their effectiveness for PSC treatment. Therefore, this review briefly summarizes the role of intestinal flora in PSC with the aim of providing new insights into PSC treatment.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a central nervous system disease that can lead to cognitive impairment and progressive memory loss. An increasing number of studies have shown that intestinal flora play a crucial role in regulating the brain-gut axis. Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites of intestinal flora that regulate hormone synthesis and play an essential role in microbial-intestinal-brain communication. An imbalance of intestinal flora can promote microglia to secrete proinflammatory factors, cause nerve inflammation, and then affect cognitive and learning ability. However, the mechanism is not clear. From this, we infer that endogenous hormones may be the medium for intestinal flora to affect the process of AD. This review of the relationships among AD, endogenous hormones, and intestinal flora expounds on the critical role of various hormones in the brain-gut axis. It discusses intervention measures aimed at intestinal flora to prevent or delay AD occurrence. Finally, the potential development prospects of fecal microbiota transplantation in treating AD are put forward, which provide potential ideas for future AD research.",

      "abstract": "In response to environmental stimuli, immune memory mediates the plasticity of myeloid cells. Immune training and immune tolerance are two aspects of plasticity. Microglia that are immunologically trained or immunologically tolerant are endowed with a tendency to differentiate into alternative dominant phenotypes (M1/M2). Male C57BL/6 mice (immune-training group, immune-tolerant group, and control group) were used to establish the kainic acid epilepsy model. The seizure grade, duration, latency, hippocampal potential, and energy density were used to evaluate seizures, and the changes in the polarization of microglia were detected by western blot. 16S rDNA sequencing showed that the abundance of Ruminococcus in the immune-tolerant group was the dominant flora. Our research connections Intestinal microorganisms, brain immune status, and epilepsy behavior together. Pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype mediate and enhance and suppress subsequent inflammation, respectively. We conclude that intestinal microorganisms influence the occurrence and development of epilepsy by regulating the polarization of microglia.",

      "abstract": "The intestinal flora plays an important role in the occurrence and development of liver cancer, affecting the efficacy and side effects of conventional antitumor therapy. Recently, immunotherapy for liver cancer has been a palliative treatment for patients with advanced liver cancer lacking surgical indications. Representative drugs include immune checkpoint inhibitors, regulators, tumor vaccines, and cellular immunotherapies. The effects of immunotherapy on liver cancer vary because of the heterogeneity of the tumors. Intestinal flora can affect the efficacy and side effects of immunotherapy for liver cancer by regulating host immunity. Therefore, applying probiotics, prebiotics, antibiotics, and fecal transplantation to interfere with the intestinal flora is expected to become an important means of assisting immunotherapy for liver cancer. This article reviews publications that discuss the relationship between intestinal flora and immunotherapy for liver cancer and further clarifies the potential relationship between intestinal flora and immunotherapy for liver cancer.",

In recent years, with the gradual deepening of the understanding of the intestinal flora, exploring renal IRI from the perspective of the intestinal flora has become a research hotspot. It is well known that the intestinal flora plays an important role in maintaining human health, and dysbiosis is the change in the composition and function of the intestinal tract, which in turn causes intestinal barrier dysfunction. Studies have shown that there are significant differences in the composition of intestinal flora before and after renal IRI, and this difference is closely related to the occurrence and development of renal IRI and affects prognosis. In addition, toxins produced by dysregulated gut microbes enter the bloodstream, which in turn exacerbates kidney damage. This article reviews the research progress of intestinal flora and renal IRI, in order to provide new treatment ideas and strategies for renal IRI.",

DON targets the intestine and is hazardous to animal, however, it is not clear whether its effect on animals is consistent. Chickens and pigs are the two main animals affected by DON exposure with different susceptibilities. In this study, we found that DON inhibited animal growth and caused damage to the intestine, liver and kidney. DON caused intestinal flora disorders in both chickens and pigs, such as changes of flora diversity and the relative abundance of dominant phyla. Functional analysis showed that changes in the intestinal flora induced by DON were mainly related to metabolic and digestive functions, indicated that the intestinal flora may be associated with the DON-induced intestinal dysfunction. Comparative analysis of differentially altered bacteria suggested that Prevotella may play an important role in maintaining intestinal health, and the presence of differentially altered bacteria in the two animals suggested that DON may have different toxicity modes in animals. In summary, we confirmed the multi-organ toxicity of DON in two major livestock and poultry animals, and speculated that the intestinal flora may be related to the toxic damage caused by DON through species comparison analysis.",

      "abstract": "The study aimed to investigate the alterations in gut microbiota among nonobese individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and their response to treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). A total of 90 patients diagnosed with NAFLD and 36 healthy subjects were recruited to participate in this study. Among them, a subgroup of 14 nonobese nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were treated with UDCA. Demographic and serologic data were collected for all participants, while stool samples were obtained for fecal microbiome analysis using 16S sequencing. In nonobese NAFLD patients, the alpha diversity of intestinal flora decreased (Shannon index, p < 0.05), and the composition of intestinal flora changed (beta diversity, p < 0.05). The abundance of 20 genera, including Fusobacterium, Lachnoclostridium, Klebsiella, etc., exhibited significant changes (p < 0.05). Among them, nine species including Fusobacterium, Lachnoclostridium, Klebsiella, etc. were found to be associated with abnormal liver enzymes and glucolipid metabolic disorders. Among the 14 NASH patients treated with UDCA, improvements were observed in terms of liver enzymes, CAP values, and E values (p < 0.05), however, no improve the glucolipid metabolism. While the alpha diversity of intestinal flora did not show significant changes after UDCA treatment, there was a notable alteration in the composition of intestinal flora (beta diversity, p < 0.05). Furthermore, UCDA treatment led to an improvement in the relative abundance of Alistipes, Holdemanella, Gilisia, etc. among nonobese NASH patients (p < 0.05). Nonobese NAFLD patients exhibit dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. UDCA can ameliorate hepatic enzyme abnormalities and reduce liver fat content in nonobese NASH patients, potentially through its ability to restore intestinal microbiota balance.",

      "abstract": "Some studies have indicated that elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels and intestinal flora may be involved in schizophrenia (SZ) cognition pathophysiology. This study was the first to investigate the association among Hcy, intestinal flora and schizophrenia cognition. Here, 140 individuals were divided into two groups: SZ patients (N = 68) and healthy controls (HCs, N = 72). Participant data on serum Hcy levels, intestinal flora and cognitive function evaluation using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) were collected. Clinical symptoms of patients were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Serum Hcy levels and the incidence of hyperhomocysteinaemia were considerably increased in SZ patients compared with HCs. Hcy levels were significantly negatively associated with verbal learning index scores (r = -0.425, p < 0.001) but positively associated with Eubacterium (r = 0.32, p = 0.007), Lactobacillus (r = 0.32, p = 0.008), Corynebacterium (r = 0.26, p = 0.035), Mogibacterium (r = 0.31, p = 0.01), and Bulleidia (r = 0.31, p = 0.01) in SZ patients. Our findings suggest that serum Hcy levels are associated with cognitive function and intestinal flora in SZ patients. However, the mechanism of the interaction between Hcy and intestinal flora and its effects on cognitive function in SZ patients requires further investigation.",

The study of intestinal flora will provide a reference for the research and treatment of disease pathogenesis. Upon hatching, fish begin to acquire a microbial community in the intestine. In response to the environment and the host itself, the fish gut eventually develops a unique set of microflora, with some microorganisms being common to different fish. The existence of intestinal microorganisms creates an excellent microecological environment for the host, while the fish symbiotically provides conditions for the growth and reproduction of intestinal microflora. The intestinal flora and the host are interdependent and mutually restrictive. This review mainly describes the formation of fish intestinal flora, the function of normal intestinal flora, factors affecting intestinal flora, and a series of fish models.",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common physiological state that affects normal human activities. Prolonged fatigue induces a variety of diseases and seriously affects human health, so it is imperative to discover nutritional dietary supplements and treatments without side effects, among which natural anti-fatigue polysaccharides have shown great potential. Polysaccharides, a class of biomolecules produced by a variety of organisms such as plants, animals, bacteria and algae, have attracted much attention in recent years due to their anti-fatigue activity and fewer side effects. This review summarizes the classification, dosage and experimental models of polysaccharides with anti-fatigue activity obtained from different natural sources. We also review the fatigue-relieving effects of these polysaccharides through mechanisms such as modulating oxidative damage, regulating energy metabolism and influencing intestinal flora, as well as the effects of molecular weights, monosaccharide compositions, structural features and chemical modifications of the polysaccharides on their anti-fatigue activities to support their potential application value in functional foods and pharmaceuticals. New valuable insights for future research on natural polysaccharides are also presented in the field of natural production of bio-based functional materials, functional foods and therapeutic agents.",

The incidence of T1D is increased sharply after the middle of the 20th century, suggesting that the environmental factors affect the occurrence and development of T1D. The diversity of human intestinal flora forms early in life and tends to stabilize around age 3. Early intestinal flora is in a dynamic process of change and is closely related to the maturation of the immune system, suggesting that early environmental exposure may be involved in the development of T1D. A variety of factors such as antibiotics and cesarean section can affect the colonization of early intestinal flora. To clarify the influence of these factors on early intestinal flora and its association with T1D, it is necessary to understand the pathogenesis of T1D and to provide an effective means for the primary prevention of T1D.",

FMT involves the transfer of healthy donor fecal microbiota into the patient's body, aiming to restore the balance of intestinal microbiota and thereby treat a variety of intestinal diseases such as recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), constipation, short bowel syndrome (SBS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). While FMT has shown high efficacy in the treatment of rCDI, further research is needed for its application in other chronic conditions. This article elaborates on the application of FMT in intestinal diseases and the mechanisms of intestinal dysbiosis, as well as discusses key factors influencing the effectiveness of FMT, including donor selection, recipient characteristics, treatment protocols, and methods for assessing microbiota. Additionally, it emphasizes the key to successful FMT. Future research should focus on optimizing the FMT process to ensure long-term safety and explore the potential application of FMT in a broader range of medical conditions.",

Brassica rapa L., known as Nozawana in Japan, is a cruciferous plant and a traditional vegetable of the Shinshu area. Nozawana leaves and stalks are processed mainly into pickled products called Nozawana-zuke. However, it is unclear whether Nozawana exerts beneficial effects on immune function. In this review, we discuss the evidence we have accumulated, which indicate Nozawana has effects on immunomodulation and gut microbiota. We have shown that Nozawana exerts an immunostimulatory effect by enhancing interferon-gamma production and natural killer activity. During the fermentation of Nozawana, the number of lactic acid bacteria increases and cytokine production by spleen cells is enhanced. Moreover, the consumption of Nozawana pickle was shown to modulate gut microbiota and improve the intestinal environment. Thus, Nozawana could be a promising food for improving human health.",

      "abstract": "Endogenous indole and its derivatives (indoles), considered as promising N-substituted heterocyclic compounds, are tryptophan metabolites derived from intestinal microbiota and exhibit a range of biological activities. Recent studies indicate that indoles contribute to maintaining the biological barrier of the human intestine, which exert the anti-inflammatory activities mainly through activating AhR and PXR receptors to affect the immune system's function, significantly improving intestinal health (inflammatory bowel disease, hemorrhagic colitis, colorectal cancer) and further promote human health (diabetes mellitus, central system inflammation, and vascular regulation). However, the revealed toxic influences cannot be ignored. Indoxyl sulfate, an indole derivative, performs nephrotoxicity and cardiovascular toxicity. We addressed the interaction between indoles and intestinal microbiota and the indoles' effects on human health as double-edged swords. This review provides scientific bases for the correlation of indoles with diseases moreover highlights several directions for subsequent indoles-related studies.",

      "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome in the late stage of cardiovascular disease and is associated with high prevalence, mortality and rehospitalisation rate. The pathophysiological mechanisms of HF have experienced the initial 'water-sodium retention' mode to 'abnormal hemodynamics' mode, and subsequent to 'abnormal activation of neuroendocrine' mode, which has extensively promoted the reform of HF treatment and updated the treatment concept. Since the Human Microbiome Project commencement, the study on intestinal microecology has swiftly developed, providing a new direction to reveal the occurrence of diseases and the mechanisms behind drug effects. Intestinal microecology comprises the gastrointestinal lumen, epithelial secretion, food entering the intestine, intestinal flora and metabolites. Choline and L-carnitine in the diet are metabolised to trimethylamine (TMA) by the intestinal micro-organisms, with TMA being absorbed into the blood. TMA then enters the liver through the portal vein circulation and is oxidised to trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) by the hepatic flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (FMO) family, especially FMO3. The circulating TMAO levels are associated with adverse outcomes in HF (mortality and readmission), and lower TMAO levels indicate better prognosis. As HF progresses, the concentration of TMAO in patients gradually increases. Whether the circulating TMAO level can be decreased by intervening with the intestinal microflora or relevant enzymes, thereby affecting the prognosis of patients with HF, has become a research hotspot. Therefore, based on the HF intestinal hypothesis, exploring the treatment strategy for HF targeting the TMAO metabolite of the intestinal flora may update the treatment concept in HF and improve its therapeutic effect.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed at investigating the effects of dietary Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) on the intestinal flora structure and barrier function of Pekin duck. A total of 180 1-day-old Pekin ducks were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates in each group and 10 birds per replicate. The birds in the control group (CON) were fed the basal diet, and those in the experimental group were fed the basal diets supplemented with 600 mg/kg SC (LSC) and 1,200 mg/kg (HSC), respectively. The trial lasted for 42 d. Results showed that LSC and HSC treatments tended to improve the feed conversion efficiency during the trial. The ileum length of birds in the LSC and HSC groups was elevated. Additionally, with 600mg/kg SC supplemented, the mRNA levels of villin, claudin3, and MUC 2 in d21 were up-regulated, as well as the mRNA levels of villin, claudin3, occludin, i-FABP, ZO-1, and MUC 2 in d42. In addition, dietary SC supplementation improved the α-diversity of the bacteria in cecal chyme and tended to increase the abundance (RA) of Bacteroidetes (P = 0.071). Besides, the RA of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 was raised in the LSC group. Beyond that, the RA of Proteobacteria was descended with two levels of SC added. In conclusion, dietary Saccharomyces cerevisiae, particularly at 600 mg/kg level, improved the intestinal flora structure and barrier function of Pekin duck.",

      "abstract": "This narrative review seeks to examine the relationships between bacterial microbiomes and infectious disease. This is achieved by detailing how different human host microbiomes develop and function, from the earliest infant acquisitions of maternal and environmental species through to the full development of microbiomes by adulthood. Communication between bacterial species or communities of species within and outside of the microbiome is a factor in both maintenance of homeostasis and management of threats from the external environment. Dysbiosis of this homeostasis is key to understanding the development of disease states. Several microbiomes and the microbiota within are used as prime examples of how changes in species composition, particularly at the phylum level, leads to such diverse conditions as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 2 diabetes, psoriasis, Parkinson's disease, reflux oesophagitis and others. The review examines spatial relationships between microbiomes to understand how dysbiosis in the gut microbiome in particular can influence diseases in distant host sites via routes such as the gut-lung, gut-skin and gut-brain axes. Microbiome interaction with host processes such as adaptive immunity is increasingly identified as critical to developing the capacity of the immune system to react to pathogens. Dysbiosis of essential bacteria involved in modification of host substrates such as bile acid components can result in development of Crohn's disease, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, hepatic cancer and obesity. Interactions between microbiomes in distantly located sites are being increasingly being identified, resulting in a 'whole of body' effect by the combined host microbiome.",

It forms a complex ecosystem that includes trillions of commensals, symbiotics, and even pathogenic microorganisms. The external environment, diet, and lifestyle are the major determinants influencing the microbiome's composition and vitality. Recent studies have indicated the tremendous influence of the microbiome on health and disease. Their number, constitution, variation, and viability are dynamic. All these elements are responsible for the induction, development, and treatment of many health disorders. Serious diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and even psychological disorders such as schizophrenia are influenced directly or indirectly by microbiota. In addition, in the last few weeks, accumulating data about the link between COVID-19 and the microbiota were published. In the present work, the role of the microbiome in health and disease is discussed. A deep understanding of the exact role of microbiota in disease induction enables the prevention of diseases and the development of new therapeutic concepts for most diseases through the correction of diet and lifestyle. The present review brings together evidence from the most recent works and discusses suggested nutraceutical approaches for the management of COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "abstract": "The lungs were long thought to be sterile until technical advances uncovered the presence of the lung microbial community. The microbiome of healthy lungs is mainly derived from the upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiome but also has its own characteristic flora. The selection mechanisms in the lung, including clearance by coughing, pulmonary macrophages, the oscillation of respiratory cilia, and bacterial inhibition by alveolar surfactant, keep the microbiome transient and mobile, which is different from the microbiome in other organs. The pulmonary bacteriome has been intensively studied recently, but relatively little research has focused on the mycobiome and virome. This up-to-date review retrospectively summarizes the lung microbiome's history, composition, and function. We focus on the interaction of the lung microbiome with the oropharynx and gut microbiome and emphasize the role it plays in the innate and adaptive immune responses. More importantly, we focus on multiple respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. The impact of the lung microbiome on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lung cancer has also been comprehensively studied. Furthermore, by summarizing the therapeutic potential of the lung microbiome in lung diseases and examining the shortcomings of the field, we propose an outlook of the direction of lung microbiome research.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence of the microbiome's role in human health and disease has emerged since the creation of the Human Microbiome Project. Recent studies suggest that alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) may play an essential role in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa), which remains the second most frequent male malignancy worldwide. Current advances in biological technologies, such as high-throughput sequencing, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, have enabled research on the gut, urinary, and intra-prostate microbiome signature and the correlation with local and systemic inflammation, host immunity response, and PCa progression. Several microbial species and their metabolites facilitate PCa insurgence through genotoxin-mediated mutagenesis or by driving tumor-promoting inflammation and dysfunctional immunosurveillance. However, the impact of the microbiome on PCa development, progression, and response to treatment is complex and needs to be fully understood. This review addresses the current knowledge on the host-microbe interaction and the risk of PCa, providing novel insights into the intraprostatic, gut, and urinary microbiome mechanisms leading to PCa carcinogenesis and treatment response. In this paper, we provide a detailed overview of diet changes, gut microbiome, and emerging therapeutic approaches related to the microbiome and PCa. Further investigation on the prostate-related microbiome and large-scale clinical trials testing the efficacy of microbiota modulation approaches may improve patient outcomes while fulfilling the literature gap of microbial-immune-cancer-cell mechanistic interactions.",

There is a vast literature on the ways these microbiomes affect hosts, but here we argue for an increased focus on how hosts affect their microbiomes. Hosts exert control over their symbionts through diverse mechanisms, including immunity, barrier function, physiological homeostasis, and transit. These mechanisms enable hosts to shape the ecology and evolution of microbiomes and generate natural selection for microbial traits that benefit the host. Our microbiomes result from a perpetual tension between host control and symbiont evolution, and we can leverage the host's evolved abilities to regulate the microbiota to prevent and treat disease. The study of host control will be central to our ability to both understand and manipulate microbiotas for better health.",

      "abstract": "There is growing interest in the potential exploitation of the gut microbiome as a diagnostic tool in medicine, but evidence supporting its clinical usefulness is scarce. An increasing number of commercial providers offer direct-to-consumer microbiome diagnostic tests without any consensus on their regulation or any proven value in clinical practice, which could result in considerable waste of individual and health-care resources and potential drawbacks in the clinical management of patients. We convened an international multidisciplinary expert panel to standardise best practices of microbiome testing for clinical implementation, including recommendations on general principles and minimum requirements for their provision, indications, pre-testing protocols, method of analyses, reporting of results, and potential clinical value. We also evaluated current knowledge gaps and future directions in this field. We aimed to establish a framework to regulate the provision of microbiome testing and minimise the use of inappropriate tests and pave the way for the evidence-based development and use of human microbiome diagnostics in clinical medicine.",

      "abstract": "To summarize the microbiome's role in metabolic disorders (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], and metabolic syndrome), systematic reviews on observational or interventional studies (prebiotics/probiotics/synbiotics/transplant) were searched in MEDLINE and Embase until September 2020. The 87 selected systematic reviews included 57 meta-analyses. Methodological quality (AMSTAR2) was moderate in 62%, 12% low, and 26% critically low. Observational studies on obesity (10 reviews) reported less gut bacterial diversity with higher Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus reuteri, Bacteroides fragilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas lower Methanobrevibacter, Lactobacillus plantarum, Akkermansia muciniphila, and Bifidobacterium animalis compared with nonobese. For diabetes (n = 1), the same was found for Fusobacterium and A. muciniphila, whereas higher Ruminococcus and lower Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Bacteroides vulgatus, and several Bifidobacterium spp. For NAFLD (n = 2), lower Firmicutes, Rikenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, whereas higher Escherichia and Lactobacillus were detected. Discriminating bacteria overlapped between metabolic disorders, those with high abundance being often involved in inflammation, whereas those with low abundance being used as probiotics. Meta-analyses (n = 54) on interventional studies reported 522 associations: 54% was statistically significant with intermediate effect size and moderate between-study heterogeneity. Meta-evidence was highest for probiotics and lowest for fecal transplant. Future avenues include better methodological quality/comparability, testing functional differences, new intervention strategies, and considerating other body habitats and kingdoms.",

      "abstract": "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been widely recognized as an approach to determine the microbiome's causal role in gut dysbiosis-related disease models and as a novel disease-modifying therapy. Despite potential beneficial FMT results in various disease models, there is a variation and complexity in procedural agreement among research groups for performing FMT. The viability of the microbiome in feces and its successful transfer depends on various aspects of donors, recipients, and lab settings. This review focuses on the technical practices of FMT in animal studies. We first document crucial factors required for collecting, handling, and processing donor fecal microbiota for FMT. Then, we detail the description of gut microbiota depletion methods, FMT dosages, and routes of FMT administrations in recipients. In the end, we describe assessments of success rates of FMT with sustainability. It is critical to work under the anaerobic condition to preserve as much of the viability of bacteria. Utilization of germ- free mice or depletion of recipient gut microbiota by antibiotics or polyethylene glycol are two common recipient preparation approaches to achieve better engraftment. Oral-gastric gavage preferred by most researchers for fast and effective administration of FMT in mice. Overall, this review highlights various methods that may lead to developing the standard and reproducible protocol for FMT.",

The first step in developing probiotics for immunotherapy is identifying helpful or harmful bacteria down to the strain level. The gut microbiome's heterogeneity before and during treatment is also being investigated to determine microbial strains that are important for immunotherapy. Moreover, Dietary fiber intake, prebiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were found to enhance intratumoral CD8+ T cell to T-reg ratio in the clinics. The possibility of probiotic immunotherapy as a \"living adjuvant\" to CAR treatment and checkpoint blockade resistance is actively being investigated.",

Gut and skin microbiota regulate more than barrier and immune function. Recent studies have shown that human microbiomes may predict aging. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss how the gut and skin microbiomes influence aging clocks as well as clarify the distinction between chronological and biological age. A literature search was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE databases with the following keywords: \"skin microbiome\" OR \"gut microbiome\" AND \"aging clock\" OR \"epigenetic\". Gut and skin microbiomes may be utilized to create aging clocks based on taxonomy, biodiversity, and functionality. The top contributing microbiota or metabolic pathways in these aging clocks may influence aging clock predictions and biological age. Furthermore, gut and skin microbiota may directly and indirectly influence aging clocks through the regulation of clock genes and the production of metabolites that serve as substrates or enzymatic regulators. Microbiome-based aging clock models may have therapeutic potential. However, more research is needed to advance our understanding of the role of microbiota in aging clocks.",

      "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease driven by T-cells against the insulin-producing islet β-cells, resulting in a marked loss of β-cell mass and function. Although a genetic predisposal increases susceptibility, the role of epigenetic and environmental factors seems to be much more significant. A dysbiotic gut microbial profile has been associated with T1D patients. Moreover, new evidence propose that perturbation in gut microbiota may influence the T1D onset and progression. One of the prominent features in clinically silent phase before the onset of T1D is the presence of a microbiota characterized by low numbers of commensals butyrate producers, thus negatively influencing the gut permeability. The loss of gut permeability leads to the translocation of microbes and microbial metabolites and could lead to the activation of immune cells. Moreover, microbiota-based therapies to slow down disease progression or reverse T1D have shown promising results. Starting from this evidence, the correction of dysbiosis in early life of genetically susceptible individuals could help in promoting immune tolerance and thus in reducing the autoantibodies production. This review summarizes the associations between gut microbiota and T1D for future therapeutic perspectives and other exciting areas of research.",

Here, we review how factors related to host genetics, ethnicity, lifestyle, and geographic location help explain this variation. Studies from contrasting environmental scenarios point to diet and lifestyle as the most influential. The effect of human migration and displacement demonstrates how the microbiome adapts to newly adopted lifestyles and contributes to the profound biological and health consequences attributed to migration. This information strongly suggests against a universal scale for healthy or dysbiotic gut microbiomes, and prompts for additional microbiome population surveys, particularly from less industrialized nations. Considering these important differences will be critical for designing strategies to diagnose and restore dysbiosis in various human populations.",

      "abstract": "The immune system plays a key role in cancer suppression. Immunotherapy is widely used as a treatment method in patients with various types of cancer. Immune checkpoint blockade using antibodies, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4, is currently gaining popularity. A systematic literature search was executed, and all available data was summarized. This review shows that specific dietary patterns (such as, e.g., animal-based, vegetarian, or Mediterranean diet) alter the gut microbiome's composition. An appropriate intestinal microbiota structure might modulate the function of human immune system, which affects the bodily anti-cancer response. This paper shows also that specific bacteria species inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract can have a beneficial influence on the efficacy of immunotherapy. Antibiotics weaken gut bacteria and worsen the immune checkpoint blockers' efficacy, whereas a faecal microbiota transplant or probiotics supplementation may help restore bacterial balance in the intestine. Other factors (like vitamins, glucose, or BMI) change the cancer treatment response, as well. This review demonstrates that there is a strong association between one's diet, gut microbiome composition, and the outcome of immunotherapy. However, further investigation on this subject is required.",

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a dynamic collection of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that performs essential functions for immune development, pathogen colonization resistance, and food metabolism. Perturbation of the gut microbiome's ecological balance, commonly by antibiotics, can cause and exacerbate diseases. To predict and successfully rescue such perturbations, first, we must understand the underlying taxonomic and functional dynamics of the microbiome as it changes throughout infancy, childhood, and adulthood. We offer an overview of the healthy gut bacterial architecture over these life stages and comment on vulnerability to short and long courses of antibiotics. Second, the resilience of the microbiome after antibiotic perturbation depends on key characteristics, such as the nature, timing, duration, and spectrum of a course of antibiotics, as well as microbiome modulatory factors such as age, travel, underlying illness, antibiotic resistance pattern, and diet. In this review, we discuss acute and chronic antibiotic perturbations to the microbiome and resistome in the context of microbiome stability and dynamics. We specifically discuss key taxonomic and resistance gene changes that accompany antibiotic treatment of neonates, children, and adults. Restoration of a healthy gut microbial ecosystem after routine antibiotics will require rationally managed exposure to specific antibiotics and microbes. To that end, we review the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics to direct recolonization of the gut ecosystem. We conclude with our perspectives on how best to assess, predict, and aid recovery of the microbiome after antibiotic perturbation.",

      "abstract": "The ever-decreasing cost of sequencing and the growing potential applications of metagenomics have led to an unprecedented surge in data generation. One of the most prevalent applications of metagenomics is the study of microbial environments, such as the human gut. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, providing vital information for patient diagnosis and prognosis. However, analysing metagenomic data remains challenging due to several factors, including reference catalogues, sparsity and compositionality. Deep learning (DL) enables novel and promising approaches that complement state-of-the-art microbiome pipelines. DL-based methods can address almost all aspects of microbiome analysis, including novel pathogen detection, sequence classification, patient stratification and disease prediction. Beyond generating predictive models, a key aspect of these methods is also their interpretability. This article reviews DL approaches in metagenomics, including convolutional networks, autoencoders and attention-based models. These methods aggregate contextualized data and pave the way for improved patient care and a better understanding of the microbiome's key role in our health.",

      "abstract": "The intratumoral microbiome (TM) refers to the microorganisms in the tumor tissues, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and so on, and is distinct from the gut microbiome and circulating microbiota. TM is strongly associated with tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, and response to therapy. This paper highlights the current status of TM. Tract sources, adjacent normal tissue, circulatory system, and concomitant tumor co-metastasis are the main origin of TM. The advanced techniques in TM analysis are comprehensively summarized. Besides, TM is involved in tumor progression through several mechanisms, including DNA damage, activation of oncogenic signaling pathways (phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K], signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT], WNT/β-catenin, and extracellular regulated protein kinases [ERK]), influence of cytokines and induce inflammatory responses, and interaction with the tumor microenvironment (anti-tumor immunity, pro-tumor immunity, and microbial-derived metabolites). Moreover, promising directions of TM in tumor therapy include immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, the application of probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics, fecal microbiome transplantation, engineered microbiota, phage therapy, and oncolytic virus therapy. The inherent challenges of clinical application are also summarized. This review provides a comprehensive landscape for analyzing TM, especially the TM-related mechanisms and TM-based treatment in cancer.",

The disappointing returns from this approach have focussed attention on narrower-spectrum antibiotics; such new agents are directed against the pathogen of relevance with the additional benefit of preserving the human microbiome(s).

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia, a severe mental illness affecting about 1% of the population, manifests during young adulthood, leading to abnormal mental function and behavior. Its multifactorial etiology involves genetic factors, experiences of adversity, infection, and gene-environment interactions. Emerging research indicates that maternal infection or stress during pregnancy may also increase schizophrenia risk in offspring. Recent research on the gut-brain axis highlights the gut microbiome's potential influence on central nervous system (CNS) function and mental health, including schizophrenia. The gut microbiota, located in the digestive system, has a significant role to play in human physiology, affecting immune system development, vitamin synthesis, and protection against pathogenic bacteria. Disruptions to the gut microbiota, caused by diet, medication use, environmental pollutants, and stress, may lead to imbalances with far-reaching effects on CNS function and mental health. Of interest are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolic byproducts produced by gut microbes during fermentation. SCFAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, influencing CNS activity, including microglia and cytokine modulation. The dysregulation of neurotransmitters produced by gut microbes may contribute to CNS disorders, including schizophrenia. This review explores the potential relationship between SCFAs, the gut microbiome, and schizophrenia. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the gut-brain axis in schizophrenia and to elucidate its implications for future research and therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Understanding of the gut microbiome's role in human physiology developed rapidly in recent years. Moreover, any alteration of this microenvironment could lead to a pathophysiological reaction of numerous organs. It results from the bidirectional communication of the gastrointestinal tract with the central nervous system, called the gut-brain axis. The signals in the gut-brain axis are mediated by immunological, hormonal, and neural pathways. However, it is also influenced by microorganisms in the gut. The disturbances in the gut-brain axis are associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, but recently their role in the development of different types of pain was reported. The gut microbiome could be the factor in the central sensitization of chronic pain by regulating microglia, astrocytes, and immune cells. Dysbiosis could lead to incorrect immune responses, resulting in the development of inflammatory pain such as endometriosis. Furthermore, chronic visceral pain, associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders, could result from a disruption in the gut microenvironment. Any alteration in the gut-brain axis could also trigger migraine attacks by affecting cytokine expression. Understanding the gut microbiome's role in pain pathophysiology leads to the development of analgetic therapies targeting microorganisms. Probiotics, FODMAP diet, and fecal microbiota transplantation are reported to be beneficial in treating visceral pain.",

This review articulates the pivotal role of the microbiome in modulating bone health, highlighting the gut-bone axis as a critical nexus for potential therapeutic intervention. Through a meticulous analysis of recent clinical research, we underscore the microbiome's influence on osteoporosis, sarcopenia, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, delineating both the direct and indirect mechanisms by which microbiota could impact musculoskeletal integrity and function. Our investigation reveals novel insights into the microbiota's contribution to bone density regulation, hormone production, immune modulation, and nutrient absorption, laying the groundwork for innovative microbiome-based strategies in musculoskeletal disease management. Significantly, we identify the challenges hindering the translation of research into clinical practice, including the limitations of current microbial sequencing techniques and the need for standardized methodologies in microbiome studies. Furthermore, we highlight promising directions for future research, particularly in the realm of personalized medicine, where the microbiome's variability offers unique opportunities for tailored treatment approaches.

Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of both established and emerging microbe-centric therapies, from probiotics to advanced microbial ecosystem therapeutics, examine the sophisticated ways in which microbes are used medicinally, and consider their impacts on microbiome homeostasis and health outcomes through a microbial ecology lens. In addition, we explore the concept of rewilding the human microbiome by reintroducing \"missing microbes\" from nonindustrialized societies and personalizing microbiome modulation to fit individual microbial profiles-highlighting several promising directions for future research. Ultimately, the advancements in sequencing technologies combined with innovative microbial therapies and personalized approaches herald a new era in medicine poised to address antibiotic resistance and improve health outcomes through targeted microbiome management.",

      "abstract": "The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a complex communication network linking the gut, microbiota, and brain, influencing various aspects of health and disease. Dysbiosis, a disturbance in the gut microbiome equilibrium, can significantly impact the MGB axis, leading to alterations in microbial composition and function. Emerging evidence highlights the connection between microbiota alterations and neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. This review explores the potential of psychobiotics in managing depressive disorders, emphasizing their role in restoring microbial balance and influencing the MGB axis. Psychobiotics exhibit positive effects on the intestinal barrier, immune response, cortisol levels, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Studies suggest that probiotics may serve as an adjunct therapy for depression, especially in treatment-resistant cases. This review discusses key findings from studies on psychobiotics interventions, emphasizing their impact on the gut-brain axis and mental health. The increasing acceptance of the expanded concept of the MGB axis underscores the importance of microorganisms in mental well-being. As our understanding of the microbiome's role in health and disease grows, probiotics emerge as promising agents for addressing mental health issues, providing new avenues for therapeutic interventions in depressive disorders.",

In this study, we conduct a large-scale excavation of soil microbial dark matter by reconstructing 40,039 metagenome-assembled genome bins (the SMAG catalogue) from 3304 soil metagenomes. We identify 16,530 of 21,077 species-level genome bins (SGBs) as unknown SGBs (uSGBs), which expand archaeal and bacterial diversity across the tree of life. We also illustrate the pivotal role of uSGBs in augmenting soil microbiome's functional landscape and intra-species genome diversity, providing large proportions of the 43,169 biosynthetic gene clusters and 8545 CRISPR-Cas genes. Additionally, we determine that uSGBs contributed 84.6% of previously unexplored viral-host associations from the SMAG catalogue. The SMAG catalogue provides an useful genomic resource for further studies investigating soil microbial biodiversity and genetic resources.",

The microbiome modulates numerous aspects of host physiology and is critical in the pathophysiology of diseases, including colon cancer. Although gut bacterial pathogenesis has become an emerging area in colon cancer, the multi-kingdom aspect of microbiome has yet to be explored. Similar to the bacterial component of the microbiome, the virome contains certain makeup that varies between individuals. In the current review, we introduce the concepts of microbiome and microbiota, research history, methods for modern microbiome studies, and recent progress of mechanisms responsible for microbiome and virome in colon cancer. Furthermore, we discuss our understanding of microbial metabolites in the disease development and therapy of colon cancer. Finally, the gut microbiota can affect the efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapy. We discuss the challenges and future perspectives in microbiome and colon cancer.

To address misunderstandings that stymie microbiome-breeding programs, we (i) clarify and visualize the corresponding elements of microbiome selection and standard selection; (ii) elucidate the eco-evolutionary processes underlying microbiome selection within a quantitative genetic framework to summarize practical guidelines that optimize microbiome breeding; and (iii) characterize the kinds of host species most amenable to microbiome breeding.",

      "abstract": "The diversity and functional significance of microbiomes have become increasingly clear through the extensive sampling of Earth's many habitats and the rapid adoption of new sequencing technologies. However, much remains unknown about what makes a \"healthy\" microbiome, how to restore a disrupted microbiome, and how microbiomes assemble. In December 2019, we convened a workshop that focused on how to identify potential \"rules of life\" that govern microbiome structure and function. This collection of mSystems Perspective pieces reflects many of the main challenges and opportunities in the field identified by both in-person and virtual workshop participants. By borrowing conceptual and theoretical approaches from other fields, including economics and philosophy, these pieces suggest new ways to dissect microbiome patterns and processes. The application of conceptual advances, including trait-based theory and community coalescence, is providing new insights on how to predict and manage microbiome diversity and function. Technological and analytical advances, including deep transfer learning, metabolic models, and advances in analytical chemistry, are helping us sift through complex systems to pinpoint mechanisms of microbiome assembly and dynamics. Integration of all of these advancements (theory, concepts, technology) across biological and spatial scales is providing dramatically improved temporal and spatial resolution of microbiome dynamics. This integrative microbiome research is happening in a new moment in science where academic institutions, scientific societies, and funding agencies must act collaboratively to support and train a diverse and inclusive community of microbiome scientists.",

Its complex etiology comprises both genetic and environmental aspects, with the intestinal and lung microbiomes emerging as newly implicated factors that can drive and aggravate asthma. Longitudinal infant cohort studies combined with mechanistic studies in animal models have identified microbial signatures causally associated with subsequent asthma risk. The recent inclusion of fungi in human microbiome surveys has revealed that microbiome signatures associated with asthma risk are not limited to bacteria, and that fungi are also implicated in asthma development in susceptible individuals. In this review, we examine the unique properties of human-associated and environmental fungi, which confer them the ability to influence immune development and allergic responses. The important contribution of fungi to asthma development and exacerbations prompts for their inclusion in current and future asthma studies in humans and animal models.",

Advanced age is also associated with elevated markers of chronic inflammation and perturbations in gut and urinary tract microbiota. One reason for the increased incidence and mortality of bladder cancer in the elderly might be that age-associated changes in multiple microbiomes induce systemic metabolic changes that contribute to immune dysregulation with potentially tumorigenic effects. The gut and urinary microbiomes could be dysregulated in bladder cancer, although the effect of these changes is poorly understood. Each of these domains - the immune system, gut microbiome and urinary microbiome - might also influence the response of patients with bladder cancer to treatment. Improved understanding of age-related alterations to the immune system and gut and urinary microbiomes could provide possible insight into the risk of bladder cancer development and progression in the elderly. In patients with bladder cancer, improved understanding of microbiota might also provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

In this Review, we explore recent studies on how our microbiomes are transmitted, beginning at birth and during interactions with other humans and the environment. We also describe the key methodological aspects of transmission inference, based on the uniqueness of the building blocks of the microbiome - single microbial strains. A better understanding of human microbiome transmission will have implications for studies of microbial host regulation, of microbiome-associated diseases, and for effective microbiome-targeting strategies. Besides exchanging strains with other humans, there is also preliminary evidence we acquire microorganisms from animals and food, and thus a complete understanding of microbiome acquisition and transmission can only be attained by adopting a One Health perspective.",

      "abstract": "Subways are urban transport systems with high capacity. Every day around the world, there are more than 150 million subway passengers. Since 2013, thousands of microbiome samples from various subways worldwide have been sequenced. Skin bacteria and environmental organisms dominate the subway microbiomes. The literature has revealed common bacterial groups in subway systems; even so, it is possible to identify cities by their microbiome. Low frequency bacteria are responsible for specific bacterial fingerprints of each subway system. Furthermore, daily subway commuters leave their microbial clouds and interact with other passengers. Microbial exchange is quite fast; the hand microbiome changes within minutes, and after cleaning the handrails, the bacteria are re-established within minutes. To investigate new taxa and metabolic pathways of subway microbial communities, several high-quality metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAG) have been described. Subways are harsh environments unfavorable for microorganism growth. However, recent studies have observed a wide diversity of viable and metabolically active bacteria. Understanding which bacteria are living, dormant, or dead allows us to propose realistic ecological interactions. Questions regarding the relationship between humans and the subway microbiome, particularly the microbiome effects on personal and public health, remain unanswered. This review summarizes our knowledge of subway microbiomes and their relationship with passenger microbiomes.",

In this review, we describe recent insights into nutrient processing in microbiomes across three exemplary yet contrasting gastrointestinal ecosystems (humans, ruminants and insects), with focus on bacterial mechanisms for the utilization of common and atypical dietary glycans as well as host-derived mucus glycans. In parallel, we discuss findings from multi-omic studies that have provided new perspectives on understanding glycan-dependent interactions and the complex food-webs of microbial populations in their natural habitat. Using key examples, we emphasize how increasing understanding of glycan processing by gut microbiomes can provide critical insights to assist 'microbiome reprogramming', a growing field that seeks to leverage diet to improve animal growth and host health.",

Here, we introduce such a method, which takes the form of a microbiome response index (MiRIx) for each antibiotic. Antibiotic-specific MiRIx values quantify the overall susceptibility of the microbiota to an antibiotic, based on databases of bacterial phenotypes and published data on intrinsic antibiotic susceptibility. We applied our approach to five published microbiome studies that carried out antibiotic interventions with vancomycin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and doxycycline. We show how MiRIx can be used in conjunction with existing microbiome analytical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the microbiome response to antibiotics. Finally, we generate antibiotic response predictions for the oral, skin, and gut microbiome in healthy humans. Our approach is implemented as open-source software and is readily applied to microbiome data sets generated by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing or shotgun metagenomics.",

This immunome-microbiome relationship influences the innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby affecting the onset and progression of reproductive disorders. However, the mechanisms governing these interactions remain elusive and require innovative approaches to gather more understanding. This comprehensive review examines the current knowledge on reproductive microbiomes across various parts of female reproductive tract, with special consideration of bidirectional interactions between microbiomes and the immune system. Additionally, it explores innate and adaptive immunity, focusing on immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibodies, their regulation, self-antigen tolerance mechanisms, and their roles in immune homeostasis. This review also highlights ongoing technological innovations in microbiota research, emphasizing the need for standardized detection and analysis methods. For instance, we evaluate the clinical utility of innovative technologies such as Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) and Microbial Flow Cytometry coupled to Next-Generation Sequencing (mFLOW-Seq). Despite ongoing advancements, we emphasize the need for further exploration in this field, as a deeper understanding of immunome-microbiome interactions holds promise for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for reproductive health, like infertility treatment and management of pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Social bee gut microbiotas play key roles in host health and performance. Worryingly, a growing body of literature shows that pesticide exposure can disturb these microbiotas. Most studies examine changes in taxonomic composition in Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiotas caused by insecticide exposure. Core bee gut microbiota taxa shift in abundance after exposure but are rarely eliminated, with declines in Bifidobacteriales and Lactobacillus near melliventris abundance being the most common shifts. Pesticide concentration, exposure duration, season and concurrent stressors all influence whether and how bee gut microbiotas are disturbed. Also, the mechanism of disturbance-i.e. whether a pesticide directly affects microbial growth or indirectly affects the microbiota by altering host health-likely affects disturbance consistency. Despite growing interest in this topic, important questions remain unanswered. Specifically, metabolic shifts in bee gut microbiotas remain largely uninvestigated, as do effects of pesticide-disturbed gut microbiotas on bee host performance. Furthermore, few bee species have been studied other than A. mellifera, and few herbicides and fungicides have been examined. We call for these knowledge gaps to be addressed so that we may obtain a comprehensive picture of how pesticides alter bee gut microbiotas, and of the functional consequences of these changes.",

      "abstract": "Parasitic and parasitoid organisms, including nematodes, trematodes, flies, ticks and wasps, rely on chemical cues to locate a host. In previous research, these cues were assumed to originate directly from the host, but in some cases it appears that the microbiome is responsible for emitting volatile organic compounds that can attract or repel parasites (Chavez et al., 2021; Takken & Verhulst, 2013). In a From the Cover paper in this issue of Molecular Ecology, Lutz et al. (2021) use multiscale analyses to demonstrate that members of the skin and oral, but not gut microbiome are correlated with ecto- and endoparasite occurrence in Afrotropical bats. That the microbiome may act as a beacon for searching parasites is an innovative mechanism for explaining how parasites find their host. This mechanism also changes our understanding of how evolutionary arms races occur between a host and parasite. Instead of reciprocal adaptations that allow the host to better defend and the parasite to better attack, each host and parasite may be attempting to manipulate or overcome manipulation of the microbiome that mediates the host-parasite interaction. While Lutz et al. (2021) establish that the skin and oral microbiomes are distinct between parasitized and nonparasitized individuals, they acknowledge that the directionality of this change cannot be determined from their data (i.e., does the microbiome differentially attract parasites or does the microbiome reflect the infection status of its host?). This leaves us with several interesting directions for future research. All of these future avenues of research have the potential to change our understanding of host-parasite coevolution, by necessitating that we extend our examination of this seemingly bipartite interaction to include a third actor-the microbiome.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota is now considered as one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of host health. Virtually all our body sites are colonised by microbes suggesting different types of crosstalk with our organs. Because of the development of molecular tools and techniques (ie, metagenomic, metabolomic, lipidomic, metatranscriptomic), the complex interactions occurring between the host and the different microorganisms are progressively being deciphered. Nowadays, gut microbiota deviations are linked with many diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, intestinal bowel diseases (IBDs) and several types of cancer. Thus, suggesting that various pathways involved in immunity, energy, lipid and glucose metabolism are affected.In this review, specific attention is given to provide a critical evaluation of the current understanding in this field. Numerous molecular mechanisms explaining how gut bacteria might be causally linked with the protection or the onset of diseases are discussed. We examine well-established metabolites (ie, short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide) and extend this to more recently identified molecular actors (ie, endocannabinoids, bioactive lipids, phenolic-derived compounds, advanced glycation end products and enterosynes) and their specific receptors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and gamma (PPARγ), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and G protein-coupled receptors (ie, GPR41, GPR43, GPR119, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5).Altogether, understanding the complexity and the molecular aspects linking gut microbes to health will help to set the basis for novel therapies that are already being developed.",

They are known to modulate the host immunity and protect from several infectious and non-infectious diseases. The colonization, killing of pathogens and induction of host cells are few of the important probiotic attributes which affect several functions of the host. In addition, prebiotics and non-digestible food substances selectively promote the growth of probiotics and human health through nutrient enrichment, and modulation of gut microbiota and immune system. This review highlights the role of probiotics and prebiotics alone and in combination (synbiotics) in the modulation of immune system, treatment of infections, management of inflammatory bowel disease and cancer therapy.

      "title": "What defines a healthy gut microbiome?",
      "abstract": "The understanding that changes in microbiome composition can influence chronic human diseases and the efficiency of therapies has driven efforts to develop microbiota-centred therapies such as first and next generation probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics, microbiota editing and faecal microbiota transplantation. Central to microbiome research is understanding how disease impacts microbiome composition and vice versa, yet there is a problematic issue with the term 'dysbiosis', which broadly links microbial imbalances to various chronic illnesses without precision or definition. Another significant issue in microbiome discussions is defining 'healthy individuals' to ascertain what characterises a healthy microbiome. This involves questioning who represents the healthiest segment of our population-whether it is those free from illnesses, athletes at peak performance, individuals living healthily through regular exercise and good nutrition or even elderly adults or centenarians who have been tested by time and achieved remarkable healthy longevity.This review advocates for delineating 'what defines a healthy microbiome?' by considering a broader range of factors related to human health and environmental influences on the microbiota. A healthy microbiome is undoubtedly linked to gut health. Nevertheless, it is very difficult to pinpoint a universally accepted definition of 'gut health' due to the complexities of measuring gut functionality besides the microbiota composition. We must take into account individual variabilities, the influence of diet, lifestyle, host and environmental factors. Moreover, the challenge in distinguishing causation from correlation between gut microbiome and overall health is presented.The review also highlights the resource-heavy nature of comprehensive gut health assessments, which hinders their practicality and broad application. Finally, we call for continued research and a nuanced approach to better understand the intricate and evolving concept of gut health, emphasising the need for more precise and inclusive definitions and methodologies in studying the microbiome.",

      "abstract": "An emerging body of literature demonstrates differences in the gut microbiome (GMB) of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to healthy controls (HC), as well as the potential benefits of prebiotic, probiotic, and synbiotic treatment. We conducted a systematic review of 24 observational studies (n = 2817), and 19 interventional trials (n = 1119). We assessed alpha diversity, beta diversity, and taxa abundance changes in patients with MDD relative to HC, as well as the effect of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on depressive symptoms in individuals with clinical or subclinical depression. We observed no significant differences in alpha diversity but a significant difference in beta diversity between patients with MDD and HC. There were fluctuations in the abundance of specific taxa in patients with MDD relative to HC. Probiotic and synbiotic, but not prebiotic, treatment showed a modest benefit in reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD over four to nine weeks. The GMB profiles of patients with MDD differ significantly from HC, but further studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and over longer follow-up before these therapies are implemented into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Aging skin, wrinkles, pigmentation, and dryness are problems that plague people, and researchers are working to solve them. Recent studies have shown that intestinal microbiota homeostasis can influence skin health, demonstrating the existence of a gut-skin axis. Recently, improving skin health through probiotic interventions has been proposed, and micro-ecological skin care is becoming a popular concept. By regulating skin health and gut-skin axis interactions, probiotics can be used as potential management tools to suppress and improve skin diseases in multiple ways, including decreasing oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory responses, and keeping immune effects. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the application and mechanisms of probiotic-mediated gut microbiota homeostasis in skin care and to offer a theoretical basis for the application of probiotics in skin care.",

      "title": "Mucus barrier, mucins and gut microbiota: the expected slimy partners?",
      "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is often considered as a key organ involved in the digestion of food and providing nutrients to the body for proper maintenance. However, this system is composed of organs that are extremely complex. Among the different parts, the intestine is viewed as an incredible surface of contact with the environment and is colonised by hundreds of trillions of gut microbes. The role of the gut barrier has been studied for decades, but the exact mechanisms involved in the protection of the gut barrier are various and complementary. Among them, the integrity of the mucus barrier is one of the first lines of protection of the gastrointestinal tract. In the past, this 'slimy' partner was mostly considered a simple lubricant for facilitating the progression of the food bolus and the stools in the gut. Since then, different researchers have made important progress, and currently, the regulation of this mucus barrier is gaining increasing attention from the scientific community. Among the factors influencing the mucus barrier, the microbiome plays a major role in driving mucus changes. Additionally, our dietary habits (ie, high-fat diet, low-fibre/high-fibre diet, food additives, pre- probiotics) influence the mucus at different levels. Given that the mucus layer has been linked with the appearance of diseases, proper knowledge is highly warranted. Here, we debate different aspects of the mucus layer by focusing on its chemical composition, regulation of synthesis and degradation by the microbiota as well as some characteristics of the mucus layer in both physiological and pathological situations.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in identifying and applying new, naturally occurring molecules that promote health. Probiotics are defined as \"live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer health benefits on the host\". Quite a few fermented products serve as the source of probiotic strains, with many factors influencing the effectiveness of probiotics, including interactions of probiotic bacteria with the host's microbiome. Prebiotics contain no microorganisms, only substances which stimulate their growth. Prebiotics can be obtained from various sources, including breast milk, soybeans, and raw oats, however, the most popular prebiotics are the oligosaccharides contained in plants. Recent research increasingly claims that probiotics and prebiotics alleviate many disorders related to the immune system, cancer metastasis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. However, little is known about the role of these supplements as important dietary components in preventing or treating cardiovascular disease. Still, some reports and clinical studies were conducted, offering new ways of treatment. Therefore, the aim of this review is to discuss the roles of gut microbiota, probiotics, and prebiotics interventions in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "The human body is full of an extensive number of commensal microbes, consisting of bacteria, viruses, and fungi, collectively termed the human microbiome. The initial acquisition of microbiota occurs from both the external and maternal environments, and the vast majority of them colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). These microbial communities play a central role in the maturation and development of the immune system, the central nervous system, and the GIT system and are also responsible for essential metabolic pathways. Various factors, including host genetic predisposition, environmental factors, lifestyle, diet, antibiotic or nonantibiotic drug use, etc., affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Recent publications have highlighted that an imbalance in the gut microflora, known as dysbiosis, is associated with the onset and progression of neurological disorders. Moreover, characterization of the microbiome-host cross talk pathways provides insight into novel therapeutic strategies. Novel preclinical and clinical research on interventions related to the gut microbiome for treating neurological conditions, including autism spectrum disorders, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and stroke, hold significant promise. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the potential involvement of the human gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, with a particular emphasis on the potential of microbe-based therapies and/or diagnostic microbial biomarkers. This review also discusses the potential health benefits of the administration of probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics, and synbiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation in neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "A promising new treatment approach for major depressive disorder (MDD) targets the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, which is linked to physiological and behavioral functions affected in MDD. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine whether short-term, high-dose probiotic supplementation reduces depressive symptoms along with gut microbial and neural changes in depressed patients. Patients with current depressive episodes took either a multi-strain probiotic supplement or placebo over 31 days additionally to treatment-as-usual. Assessments took place before, immediately after and again four weeks after the intervention. The Hamilton Depression Rating Sale (HAM-D) was assessed as primary outcome. Quantitative microbiome profiling and neuroimaging was used to detect changes along the MGB axis. In the sample that completed the intervention (probiotics N = 21, placebo N = 26), HAM-D scores decreased over time and interactions between time and group indicated a stronger decrease in the probiotics relative to the placebo group. Probiotics maintained microbial diversity and increased the abundance of the genus Lactobacillus, indicating the effectivity of the probiotics to increase specific taxa. The increase of the Lactobacillus was associated with decreased depressive symptoms in the probiotics group. Finally, putamen activation in response to neutral faces was significantly decreased after the probiotic intervention. Our data imply that an add-on probiotic treatment ameliorates depressive symptoms (HAM-D) along with changes in the gut microbiota and brain, which highlights the role of the MGB axis in MDD and emphasizes the potential of microbiota-related treatment approaches as accessible, pragmatic, and non-stigmatizing therapies in MDD.

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence demonstrates that alterations to the gut microbiota can affect mood, suggesting that the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis contributes to the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these pathways overlap with the way in which the gut microbiota are thought to contribute to metabolic disease progression and obesity. In rodents, prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to modulate the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Together with germ-free rodent models, probiotics have provided compelling evidence for a causal relationship between microbes, microbial metabolites, and altered neurochemical signalling and inflammatory pathways in the brain. In humans, probiotic supplementation has demonstrated modest antidepressant effects in individuals with depressive symptoms, though more studies in clinically relevant populations are needed. This review critically discusses the role of the MGB axis in depression pathophysiology, integrating preclinical and clinical evidence, as well as the putative routes of communication between the microbiota-gut interface and the brain. A critical overview of the current approaches to investigating microbiome changes in depression is provided. To effectively translate preclinical breakthroughs in MGB axis research into novel therapies, rigorous placebo-controlled trials alongside a mechanistic and biochemical understanding of prebiotic and probiotic action are required from future research.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of neurodegenerative disorders affecting mostly the elderly. It is characterized by the presence of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), resulting in cognitive and memory impairment. Research shows that alteration in gut microbial diversity and defects in gut brain axis are linked to AD. Probiotics are known to be one of the best preventative measures against cognitive decline in AD. Numerous in vivo trials and recent clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of selected bacterial strains in slowing down the progression of AD. It is proven that probiotics modulate the inflammatory process, counteract with oxidative stress, and modify gut microbiota. Thus, this review summarizes the current evidence, diversity of bacterial strains, defects of gut brain axis in AD, harmful bacterial for AD, and the mechanism of action of probiotics in preventing AD. A literature search on selected databases such as PubMed, Semantic Scholar, Nature, and Springer link have identified potentially relevant articles to this topic. However, upon consideration of inclusion criteria and the limitation of publication year, only 22 articles have been selected to be further reviewed. The search query includes few sets of keywords as follows. (1) Probiotics OR gut microbiome OR microbes AND (2) Alzheimer OR cognitive OR aging OR dementia AND (3) clinical trial OR in vivo OR animal study. The results evidenced in this study help to clearly illustrate the relationship between probiotic supplementation and AD. Thus, this systematic review will help identify novel therapeutic strategies in the future as probiotics are free from triggering any adverse effects in human body.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders represent a primary source of disability worldwide, manifesting as disturbances in individuals' cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and behavioral patterns. In the quest to discover novel therapies and expand the boundaries of neuropharmacology, studies from the field have highlighted the gut microbiota's role in modulating these disorders. These alterations may influence the brain's processes through the brain-gut axis, a multifaceted bidirectional system that establishes a connection between the enteric and central nervous systems. Thus, probiotic and prebiotic supplements that are meant to influence overall gut health may play an insightful role in alleviating psychiatric symptoms, such as the cognitive templates of major depressive disorder, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Moreover, the administration of psychotropic drugs has been revealed to induce specific changes in a microbiome's diversity, suggesting their potential utility in combating bacterial infections. This review emphasizes the intricate correlations between psychiatric disorders and the gut microbiota, mentioning the promising approaches in regard to the modulation of probiotic and prebiotic treatments, as well as the antimicrobial effects of psychotropic medication.",

      "abstract": "Despite the promising advances in novel cancer therapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), limitations including therapeutic resistance and toxicity remain. In recent years, the relationship between gut microbiota and cancer has been extensively studied. Accumulating evidence reveals the role of microbiota in defining cancer therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Unlike host genetics, microbiota can be easily modified via multiple strategies, including faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics and antibiotics. Preclinical studies have identified the mechanisms on how microbes influence cancer treatment outcomes. Clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential of microbiota modulation in cancer treatments. Herein, we review the mechanistic insights of gut microbial interactions with chemotherapy and ICIs, particularly focusing on the interplay between gut bacteria and the pharmacokinetics (eg, metabolism, enzymatic degradation) or pharmacodynamics (eg, immunomodulation) of cancer treatment. The translational potential of basic findings in clinical settings is then explored, including using microbes as predictive biomarkers and microbial modulation by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modulations and FMT. We further discuss the current limitations of gut microbiota modulation in patients with cancer and suggest essential directions for future study. In the era of personalised medicine, it is crucial to understand the microbiota and its interactions with cancer. Manipulating the gut microbiota to augment cancer therapeutic responses can provide new insights into cancer treatment.",

Although probiotics are traditionally being supplemented to promote treatments or sustain therapeutic benefits; the FDA has not approved any for use with immunotherapy. The first step in developing probiotics for immunotherapy is identifying helpful or harmful bacteria down to the strain level. The gut microbiome's heterogeneity before and during treatment is also being investigated to determine microbial strains that are important for immunotherapy. Moreover, Dietary fiber intake, prebiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were found to enhance intratumoral CD8+ T cell to T-reg ratio in the clinics. The possibility of probiotic immunotherapy as a \"living adjuvant\" to CAR treatment and checkpoint blockade resistance is actively being investigated.",

      "title": "Probiotics: Potential novel therapeutics for microbiota-gut-brain axis dysfunction across gender and lifespan.",
      "abstract": "Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, present a health benefit for the host. While the beneficial effects of probiotics on gastrointestinal function are generally well recognized, new animal research and clinical studies have found that alterations in gut microbial communities can have a broad range of effects throughout the body. Non-intestinal sites impacted include the immune, endocrine, cardiovascular and the central nervous system (CNS). In particular, there has been a growing interest and appreciation about the role that gut microbiota may play in affecting CNS-related function through the 'microbiota-gut-brain axis'. Emerging evidence suggests potential therapeutic benefits of probiotics in several CNS conditions, such as anxiety, depression, autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson's disease. There may also be some gender-specific variances in terms of probiotic mediated effects, with the gut microbiota shaping and being concurrently molded by the hormonal environment governing differences between the sexes. Probiotics may influence the ability of the gut microbiome to affect a variety of biological processes in the host, including neurotransmitter activity, vagal neurotransmission, generation of neuroactive metabolites and inflammatory response mediators. Some of these may engage in cross talk with host sex hormones, such as estrogens, which could be of relevance in relation to their effects on stress response and cognitive health. This raises the possibility of gender-specific variation with regards to the biological action of probiotics, including that on the endocrine and central nervous systems. In this review we aim to describe the current understanding in relation to the role and use of probiotics in microbiota-gut-brain axis-related dysfunction. Furthermore, we will address the conceptualization and classification of probiotics in the context of gender and lifespan as well as how restoring gut microbiota composition by clinical or dietary intervention can help in supporting health outcomes other than those related to the gastrointestinal tract. We also evaluate how these new learnings may impact industrial effort in probiotic research and the discovery and development of novel and more personalized, condition-specific, beneficial probiotic therapeutic agents.",

Gut microbiota is believed to have a significant impact on oral tolerance to food antigens and in initiation and maintenance of food allergies. Therefore, probiotics have also been proposed in this field as a possible strategy for modulating both the gut microbiota and the immune system. In recent years, results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest a promising role for probiotics in food allergy prevention and treatment. However, future studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of action of probiotics in food allergies and to design comparable study protocols using specific probiotic strains, defined doses and exposure times, and longer follow-up periods.",

      "abstract": "Recent and continuing advances in gut microbiome research have pointed out the role of the gut microbiota as an unexplored source of potentially beneficial probiotic microbes. Along the lines of these advances, both public awareness and acceptance of probiotics are increasing. That's why; academic and industrial research is dedicated to identifying and investigating new microbial strains for the development of next-generation probiotics (NGPs). At this time, there is a growing interest in NGPs as biotherapeutics that alter the gut microbiome and affect various diseases development. In this work, we have focused on some emergent and promising NGPs, specifically Eubacterium hallii, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia spp., Akkermansia muciniphila, and Bacteroides fragilis, as their presence in the gut can have an impact on the development of various diseases. Emerging studies point out the beneficial roles of these NGPs and open up novel promising therapeutic options. Interestingly, these NGPs were found to enhance gastrointestinal immunity, enhance immunotherapy efficacy in cancer patients, retain the intestinal barrier integrity, generate valuable metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, and decrease complications of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although many of these NGPs are considered promising for the prevention and treatment of several chronic diseases, research on humans is still lacking. Therefore, approval of these microbes from regulatory agencies is rare. Besides, some issues limit their wide use in the market, such as suitable methods for the culture and storage of these oxygen-sensitive microbes. The present review goes over the main points related to NGPs and gives a viewpoint on the key issues that still hinder their wide application. Furthermore, we have focused on the advancement in NGPs and human healthiness investigations by clarifying the limitations of traditional probiotic microorganisms, discussing the characteristics of emerging NGPs and defining their role in the management of certain ailments. Future research should emphasize the isolation, mechanisms of action of these probiotics, safety, and clinical efficacy in humans.",

However, it is still unclear whether this applies to older individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We aimed to explore the effects of probiotic supplementation on multiple neural behaviors in older adults with MCI. Forty-two MCI patients (age > 60 years) were randomly divided into two groups and consumed either probiotics (n=21) or placebo (n=21) for 12 weeks. Various scale scores, gut microbiota measures and serological indicators were recorded pre- and posttreatment. After 12 weeks of intervention, cognitive function and sleep quality were improved in the probiotic group compared with those in the control group, and the underlying mechanisms were associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that probiotic treatment enhanced cognitive function and sleep quality in older MCI patients, thus providing important insights into the clinical prevention and treatment of MCI.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiome maturation in infants born prematurely is uniquely influenced by the physiological, clinical, and environmental factors surrounding preterm birth and early life, leading to altered patterns of microbial succession relative to term infants during the first months of life. These differences in microbiome composition are implicated in acute clinical conditions that disproportionately affect preterm infants, including necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). Probiotic supplementation initiated early in life is an effective prophylactic measure for preventing NEC, LOS, and other clinical concerns relevant to preterm infants. In parallel, reported benefits of probiotics on the preterm gut microbiome, metabolome, and immune function are beginning to emerge. This review summarizes the current literature on the influence of probiotics on the gut microbiome of preterm infants, outlines potential mechanisms by which these effects are exerted, and highlights important clinical considerations for determining the best practices for probiotic use in premature infants.",

Therefore, an effect on depression has already been suggested by recent research. The aim of this randomized double-blind controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of probiotic treatment in depressed individuals. Within inpatient care, 82 currently depressed individuals were randomly assigned to either receive a multistrain probiotic plus biotin treatment or biotin plus placebo for 28 days. Clinical symptoms as well as gut microbiome were analyzed at the begin of the study, after one and after four weeks. After 16S rRNA analysis, microbiome samples were bioinformatically explored using QIIME, SPSS, R and Piphillin. Both groups improved significantly regarding psychiatric symptoms. ",

      "abstract": "The gut microbial ecosystem, which is a collection of the host-microbiota interactions and the inter-species interplay among bacteria-dominated microbiota, has become a research hotspot due to its contribution to host health in recent years. Lactobacillus, which has worldwide usage in fermented dairy products, has aroused increasing attention and becomes one of the commonly used probiotics given its promising applications in intestinal health and disease, though it occupies a relatively small proportion of the intestinal microbiota. In the review, we first update the current understanding of determinants of Lactobacillus abundance in the intestinal tract. We then review evidence from animal models to human trials that provided insights into Lactobacillus's applications in common intestinal disorders including the Helicobacter pylori infection, colorectal cancer, diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Mechanisms underlying the probiotic role of Lactobacillus are finally discussed in five aspects: microbial interactions, the improvement of intestinal barrier function, the immunoregulation, the anticancer activity, and the metabolic regulation. This review aims to yield a profound understanding of how Lactobacillus will contribute to disease prevention and individualized therapies in future clinical practice, and to inspire novel microbial strategies utilizing both probiotics and their products in the fields of biology and medicine.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. The etiology of the disorder is multi-factorial, with a main focus on genetic factors. However, emerging research shows the involvement of changes and imbalances in the intestinal microbiota. Evidence for the influence of gut microbiota on brain development and neurogenesis is clear. We present a review of emerging research on the microbiota in the ADHD population. The aim of this study was to summarize the current state of knowledge on ADHD, to identify gaps in knowledge, as well as to indicate the directions of new research. Thanks to the researchers that would be possible to better understand the complexity of ADHD etiology, especially the role of the intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Pubmed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were used while writing the review. Numerous studies show that probiotic supplementation can have a positive effect on the course of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD. Unfortunately, clinical studies that were identified are mostly inconclusive, and more high-quality research is needed to produce robust evidence for therapy based on interventions targeting microbiota.",

      "title": "Gut microbiome stability and resilience: elucidating the response to perturbations in order to modulate gut health.",
      "abstract": "The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, densely colonised by thousands of microbial species. It varies among individuals and depends on host genotype and environmental factors, such as diet and antibiotics. In this review, we focus on stability and resilience as essential ecological characteristics of the gut microbiome and its relevance for human health. Microbial diversity, metabolic flexibility, functional redundancy, microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions seem to be critical for maintaining resilience. The equilibrium of the gut ecosystem can be disrupted by perturbations, such as antibiotic therapy, causing significant decreases in functional richness and microbial diversity as well as impacting metabolic health. As a consequence, unbalanced states or even unhealthy stable states can develop, potentially leading to or supporting diseases. Accordingly, strategies have been developed to manipulate the gut microbiome in order to prevent or revert unhealthy states caused by perturbations, including faecal microbiota transplantation, supplementation with probiotics or non-digestible carbohydrates, and more extensive dietary modifications. Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies has evidenced interindividual variability in extent and direction of response to diet and perturbations, which has been attributed to the unique characteristics of each individual's microbiome. From a clinical, translational perspective, the ability to improve resilience of the gut microbial ecosystem prior to perturbations, or to restore its equilibrium afterwards, would offer significant benefits. To be effective, this therapeutic approach will likely need a personalised or subgroup-based understanding of individual genetics, diet, gut microbiome and other environmental factors that might be involved.",

The gut microbiome and diet are key environmental factors that influence the onset and progression of IBD and can be leveraged for treatment.

We discuss available data and the advantages and drawbacks of the different approaches to manipulate the gut microbiome, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation and conventional probiotics, and postbiotics. We also review the use of diet as a therapeutic tool in IBD, including the effects in induction and maintenance, special diets, and exclusive enteral nutrition. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities for the translation of diet and microbiome interventions into clinical practice, such as the need for personalization, manufacturing and regulatory hurdles, and the specificity to take into account for clinical trial design.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) remains one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders seen by clinicians in both primary and secondary care. Since publication of the last British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guideline in 2007, substantial advances have been made in understanding its complex pathophysiology, resulting in its re-classification as a disorder of gut-brain interaction, rather than a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Moreover, there has been a considerable amount of new evidence published concerning the diagnosis, investigation and management of IBS. The primary aim of this guideline, commissioned by the BSG, is to review and summarise the current evidence to inform and guide clinical practice, by providing a practical framework for evidence-based management of patients. One of the strengths of this guideline is that the recommendations for treatment are based on evidence derived from a comprehensive search of the medical literature, which was used to inform an update of a series of trial-based and network meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of dietary, pharmacological and psychological therapies in treating IBS. Specific recommendations have been made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, summarising both the strength of the recommendations and the overall quality of evidence. Finally, this guideline identifies novel treatments that are in development, as well as highlighting areas of unmet need for future research.",

The emergence and ongoing spread of AMR pathogens is a challenging public health issue. Recent evidence showed that probiotics and prebiotics may play a role in decolonizing drug-resistant pathogens by enhancing the colonization resistance in the gut. This review aims to analyze available evidence from human-controlled trials to determine the effect size of probiotic interventions in decolonizing AMR pathogenic bacteria from the gut. We further studied the effects of prebiotics in human and animal studies. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL were used to collect articles. The random-effects model meta-analysis was used to pool the data. GRADE Pro and Cochrane collaboration tools were used to assess the bias and quality of evidence. Out of 1395 citations, 29 RCTs were eligible, involving 2871 subjects who underwent either probiotics or placebo treatment to decolonize AMR pathogens. The persistence of pathogenic bacteria after treatment was 22%(probiotics) and 30.8%(placebo). The pooled odds ratio was 0.59(95% CI:0.43-0.81), favoring probiotics with moderate certainty (",

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics on patients with depression. We searched six databases up to July 2022. In total, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 786 participants were included. The overall results demonstrated that patients who received prebiotics, probiotics or synbiotics had significantly improved symptoms of depression compared with those in the placebo group. However, subgroup analysis only confirmed the significant antidepressant effects of agents that contained probiotics. In addition, patients with mild or moderate depression could both benefit from the treatment. Studies with a lower proportion of females reported stronger effects for alleviating depressive symptoms. In conclusion, agents that manipulate gut microbiota might improve mild-to-moderate depression. It is necessary to further investigate the benefits of prebiotic, probiotic and synbiotic treatments relative to antidepressants and follow up with individuals over a longer time before these therapies are implemented in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common disorders among women in modern societies. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of PCOS. These women often exhibit high insulin resistance (IR), hyperandrogenism, irregular periods, and infertility. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota (GMB) in women with PCOS has attracted the attention of many researchers. Porphyromonas spp., B. coprophilus, and F. prausnitzii are found in higher numbers in the gut of women with PCOS. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced by the intestinal microbiota through fermentation, play an essential role in regulating metabolic activities and are helpful in reducing insulin resistance and improving PCOS symptoms. According to studies, the bacteria producing SCFAs in the gut of these women are less abundant than in healthy women. The effectiveness of using probiotic supplements has been proven to improve the condition of women with PCOS. Daily consumption of probiotics improves dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome and increases the production of SCFAs.",

While antibiotics remain a common treatment, prolonged use has significant adverse effects and can lead to antibiotic resistance. This study evaluated the impact of combined probiotics and doxycycline treatment on rosacea, emphasizing the gut-skin axis. Sixty rosacea patients were randomly assigned to the probiotic, placebo, or control groups. After a 2-week doxycycline treatment, participants underwent a 3-month intervention with either a placebo, probiotic, or no further treatment. Clinical outcomes were assessed at baseline and after the 14-week intervention. Our results showed that probiotic administration improved facial skin conditions, alleviated inflammation, and reduced facial skin microbiota diversity while enhancing gut microbiota heterogeneity. Multivariate analysis identified microbial markers distinguishing the probiotic group from the control and placebo groups, and some markers were associated with skin health parameters. After the probiotic intervention, some facial skin-associated taxa, such as ",

      "abstract": "The emerging role of a microbiota-gut-brain axis in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that modulating gut microbial composition may offer a tractable approach to addressing the lifelong challenges of ASD. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview and critically evaluate the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, and fecal microbiota transplantation therapies for core and co-occurring behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were performed from inception to March 5, 2020, and two update searches were completed on October 25, 2020, and April 22, 2021, respectively. A total of 4306 publications were identified, of which 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a preconstructed form. Results of probiotic studies do not confirm the supposed beneficial effect of probiotics on ASD, whereas prebiotics and synbiotic combinations appear to be efficacious in selective behavioral symptoms. Evidence of the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in ASD is still scarce but supports further research. Overall, the current evidence base to suggest beneficial effects of these modalities in ASD is limited and inconclusive. More clinical trials are currently looking at the use of microbial-based therapies in ASD. With a robust double-blind randomized controlled protocol to investigate the efficacy, these trials should provide significant and definitive results. LAY SUMMARY: There is a link between altered gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder. Some people believe that modulating bacterial composition in the gut may help reduce autism symptoms, but evidence from human studies suggesting beneficial effects of probiotic, prebiotic, and combination thereof as well as fecal transplants in autism spectrum disorder is limited and inconclusive. Current data should not encourage use of these modalities. Further clinical studies are needed.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the gut microbiota in some skin inflammatory diseases, including acne vulgaris, has been emphasized. Probiotics could play a role in the modulation of the microbiota, improving the clinical course of this disease. A 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with patients aged 12 to 30 years with acne vulgaris was conducted. The study product was a capsule composed of the probiotic Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (CECT 30031) and the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis (BEA_IDA_0074B). Patients with improvement in the Acne Global Severity Scale were 10/34 (29.41%) in the placebo group compared with 20/40 (50%) in the probiotic group (p = 0.03). A significant reduction (p = 0.03) in the number of non-inflammatory acne lesions was observed in the probiotic group (-18.60 [-24.38 to -12.82]) vs the placebo group (-10.54 [-17.43 to -3.66]). Regarding the number of total  lesions, a reduction almost reaching statistical significance (p = 0.06) was observed in the probiotic group (-27.94 [-36.35 to -19.53]) compared with the placebo group (-18.31 [-28.21 to -8.41]). In addition, patients with improvement attending the Global Acne Grading System were 7/34 (20.58%) in the placebo group vs 17/40 (42.50%) in the probiotic group (p = 0.02). The number of adverse events was similar in both groups. The probiotic used in this study was effective and well tolerated, and it should be considered for acne vulgaris patients.",

      "abstract": "Unintentional hypothermia (core temperature < 36 °C) is a common side effect in patients undergoing surgery. Several patient-centred and external factors, e.g., drugs, comorbidities, trauma, environmental temperature, type of anaesthesia, as well as extent and duration of surgery, influence core temperature. Perioperative hypothermia has negative effects on coagulation, blood loss and transfusion requirements, metabolization of drugs, surgical site infections, and discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Therefore, active temperature management is required in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative period to diminish the risks of perioperative hypothermia. Temperature measurement should be done with accurate and continuous probes. Perioperative temperature management includes a bundle of warming tools adapted to individual needs and local circumstances. Warming blankets and mattresses as well as the administration of properly warmed infusions via dedicated devices are important for this purpose. Temperature management should follow checklists and be individualized to the patient's requirements and the local possibilities.",

      "abstract": "The climate change induced global warming, and in particular the increased frequency and intensity of heat waves, have been linked to health problems. Among them, scientific works have been reporting an increased incidence of neurological diseases, encompassing also neurodegenerative ones, such as Dementia of Alzheimer's type, Parkinson's Disease, and Motor Neuron Diseases. Although the increase in prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is well documented by literature reports, the link between global warming and the enhanced prevalence of such diseases remains elusive. This is the main theme of our work, which aims to examine the connection between high temperature exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, we evaluate the influence of high temperatures exposure on the pathophysiology of these disorders. Secondly, we discuss its effects on the thermoregulation, already compromised in affected patients, and its interference with processes of excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, all of them related with neurodegeneration. Finally, we investigate chronic versus acute stressors on body warming, and put forward a possible interpretation of the beneficial or detrimental effects on the brain, which is responsible for the incidence or progression of neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Climate Change and Emerging Food Safety Issues: A Review.",
      "abstract": "Throughout the past decades, climate change has been one of the most complex global issues. Characterized by worldwide alterations in weather patterns, along with a concomitant increase in the temperature of the Earth, climate change will undoubtedly have significant effects on food security and food safety. Climate change engenders climate variability: significant variations in weather variables and their frequency. Both climate variability and climate change are thought to threaten the safety of the food supply chain through different pathways. One such pathway is the ability to exacerbate foodborne diseases by influencing the occurrence, persistence, virulence and, in some cases, toxicity of certain groups of disease-causing microorganisms. Food safety can also be compromised by various chemical hazards, such as pesticides, mycotoxins, and heavy metals. With changes in weather patterns, such as lower rainfall, higher air temperature, and higher frequency of extreme weather events among others, this translates to emerging food safety concerns. These include the shortage of safe water for irrigation of agricultural produce, greater use of pesticides due to pest resistance, increased difficulty in achieving a well-controlled cold chain resulting in temperature abuse, or the occurrence of flash floods, which cause runoff of chemical contaminants in natural water courses. Together, these can result in foodborne infection, intoxication, antimicrobial resistance, and long-term bioaccumulation of chemicals and heavy metals in the human body. Furthermore, severe climate variability can result in extreme weather events and natural calamities, which directly or indirectly impair food safety. This review discusses the causes and impacts of climate change and variability on existing and emerging food safety risks and also considers mitigation and adaptation strategies to address the global warming and climate change problem.",

      "title": "Environmental and Occupational Considerations of Anesthesia: A Narrative Review and Update.",
      "abstract": "With an estimated worldwide volume of 266 million surgeries in 2015, the call for general inhalation anesthesia is considerable. However, widely used volatile anesthetics such as N2O and the highly fluorinated gases sevoflurane, desflurane, and isoflurane are greenhouse gases, ozone-depleting agents, or both. Because these agents undergo minimal metabolism in the body during clinical use and are primarily (≥95%) eliminated unchanged via exhalation, waste anesthetic gases (WAGs) in operating rooms and postanesthesia care units can pose a challenge for overall elimination and occupational exposure. The chemical properties and global warming impacts of these gases vary, with atmospheric lifetimes of 1-5 years for sevoflurane, 3-6 years for isoflurane, 9-21 years for desflurane, and 114 years for N2O. Additionally, the use of N2O as a carrier gas for the inhalation anesthetics and as a supplement to intravenous (IV) anesthetics further contributes to these impacts. At the same time, unscavenged WAGs can result in chronic occupational exposure of health care workers to potential associated adverse health effects. Few adverse effects associated with WAGs have been documented, however, when workplace exposure limits are implemented. Specific measures that can help reduce occupational exposure and the environmental impact of inhaled anesthetics include efficient ventilation and scavenging systems, regular monitoring of airborne concentrations of waste gases to remain below recommended limits, ensuring that anesthesia equipment is well maintained, avoiding desflurane and N2O if possible, and minimizing fresh gas flow rates (eg, use of low-flow anesthesia). One alternative to volatile anesthetics may be total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). While TIVA is not associated with the risks of occupational exposure or atmospheric pollution that are inherent to volatile anesthetic gases, clinical considerations should be weighed in the choice of agent. Appropriate procedures for the disposal of IV anesthetics must be followed to minimize any potential for negative environmental effects. Overall, although their contributions are relatively low compared with those of other human-produced substances, inhaled anesthetics are intrinsically potent greenhouse gases and pose a risk to operating-room personnel if not properly managed and scavenged. Factors to reduce waste and minimize the future impact of these substances should be considered.",

      "title": "Optimum growth temperature declines with body size within fish species.",
      "abstract": "According to the temperature-size rule, warming of aquatic ecosystems is generally predicted to increase individual growth rates but reduce asymptotic body sizes of ectotherms. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how growth and key processes affecting it, such as consumption and metabolism, depend on both temperature and body mass within species. This limits our ability to inform growth models, link experimental data to observed growth patterns, and advance mechanistic food web models. To examine the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual growth, as well as the link between maximum consumption, metabolism, and body growth, we conducted a systematic review and compiled experimental data on fishes from 52 studies that combined body mass and temperature treatments. By fitting hierarchical models accounting for variation between species, we estimated how maximum consumption and metabolic rate scale jointly with temperature and body mass within species. We found that whole-organism maximum consumption increases more slowly with body mass than metabolism, and is unimodal over the full temperature range, which leads to the prediction that optimum growth temperatures decline with body size. Using an independent dataset, we confirmed this negative relationship between optimum growth temperature and body size. Small individuals of a given population may, therefore, exhibit increased growth with initial warming, whereas larger conspecifics could be the first to experience negative impacts of warming on growth. These findings help advance mechanistic models of individual growth and food web dynamics and improve our understanding of how climate warming affects the growth and size structure of aquatic ectotherms.",

      "abstract": "Cold weather injuries are relevant concerns for children during winter sports and outdoor activities. To mitigate the risk of cold injury in this high-risk population, providers can educate parents on proper outdoor attire as well as the added risks of wind and water exposure. There are 2 types of environmental cold injuries: freezing injuries and nonfreezing injuries. Frostbite is a freezing injury from direct contact with cold air or surfaces. The extent of injury depends on the depth to which the freezing extends. Treatment involves rewarming the frozen tissue with warm water baths and considering analgesia. Hypothermia is a nonfreezing cold injury, and it can occur even when ambient temperatures are above freezing. When there is a decrease in the body's core temperature, hypothermia progresses from mild to severe symptoms. Treatment of hypothermia is threefold but is also dependent on the core body temperature, as colder core temperatures will require more aggressive warming techniques. Hypothermia treatment involves passive protection from further heat loss (ie, removing wet clothing), which helps the body to warm itself. Treatment also involves active external rewarming wherein a heat source, such as a heated blanket, is used to increase body temperature. Active internal rewarming is the delivery of heat inside the patient's body, such as warmed intravenous fluids.",

      "abstract": "The unbearable heat waves that we are experiencing these days around the world are the result of increasing global warming, leading to heat stress and a constant health issue for the existing population. The thermoregulatory dysfunction of the human body due to climatological changes might result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance and transforms the human body from a normal physiological condition to a distorted pathological state. Subsequently, at one point in time, the human body may fail to handle its normal thermoregulatory function in the form of sudden unconsciousness and health defects. There might be associated dehydration that imposes renal damage, even to the extent to cause acute kidney injury (AKI), followed by chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thus, we cannot deny CKD as a major cause of death, mainly in patients having long-standing medical issues such as cardiac dysfunction, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, heat stress nephropathy (HSN) might therefore become a major health problem. There is always a hopeful way in our hands, fortunately, which is of course prevention, that comes through government policies and human awareness. The present review brings out light on the alarming resultant facts of heat stress, dehydration, its pathology, molecular derangements, and recommendations for the prevention of heat stress nephropathy.",

      "abstract": "As temperatures increase, there is growing evidence that species across much of the tree of life are getting smaller. These climate change-driven size reductions are often interpreted as a temporal analogue of the observation that individuals within a species tend to be smaller in the warmer parts of the species' range. For ectotherms, there has been a broad effort to understand the role of developmental plasticity in temperature-size relationships, but in endotherms, this mechanism has received relatively little attention in favour of selection-based explanations. We review the evidence for a role of developmental plasticity in warming-driven size reductions in birds and highlight insulin-like growth factors as a potential mechanism underlying plastic responses to temperature in endotherms. We find that, as with ectotherms, changes in temperature during development can result in shifts in body size in birds, with size reductions associated with warmer temperatures being the most frequent association. This suggests developmental plasticity may be an important, but largely overlooked, mechanism underlying warming-driven size reductions in endotherms. Plasticity and natural selection have very different constraining forces, thus understanding the mechanism linking temperature and body size in endotherms has broad implications for predicting future impacts of climate change on biodiversity.",

With the emerging wearable electronics, higher tactility and skin affinity are pursued for safe and user-friendly human-robot interactions. Fabrics interlocked by fibers perform traditional static functions such as warming, protection, and fashion. Recently, dynamic fibers and fabrics are favorable to deliver active stimulus responses such as sensing and actuating abilities for soft-robots and wearables. First, the responsive mechanisms of fiber/fabric actuators and their performances under various external stimuli are reviewed. Fiber/yarn-based artificial muscles for soft-robots manipulation and assistance in human motion are discussed, as well as smart clothes for improving human perception. Second, the geometric designs, fabrications, mechanisms, and functions of fibers/fabrics for sensing and energy harvesting from the human body and environments are summarized. Effective integration between the electronic components with garments, human skin, and living organisms is illustrated, presenting multifunctional platforms with self-powered potential for human-robot interactions and biomedicine. Lastly, the relationships between robotic/wearable fibers/fabrics and the external stimuli, together with the challenges and possible routes for revolutionizing the robotic fibers/fabrics and wearables in this new era are proposed.",

      "abstract": "In mammals, body-size responses to warming climates are diverse, and the mechanisms underlying these different responses have been little investigated. Using temporal and spatial datasets of three rodent species distributed across different climatic zones in China, we investigated temporal and spatial trends of body size (length and mass), identified the critical drivers of these trends, and inferred the potential causes underlying the distinct body-size responses to the critical drivers. We found that body mass of all species remained stable over time and across space. Body length, however, increased in one species over time and in two species across space. Generally, body-length variation was predicted best by minimum ambient temperature. Moreover, in two species, body length changed linearly with temperature differences between ancestral and colonization areas. These distinct temperature-length patterns may jointly be caused by species-specific temperature sensitivities and experienced magnitudes of warming. We hypothesize that species or populations distributed across distinct temperature gradients evolved different intrinsic temperature sensitivities, which affect how their body sizes respond to warming climates. Our results suggest that size trends associated with climate change should be explored at higher temporal and spatial resolutions, and include clades of species with similar distributions.",

      "title": "How will warming affect the growth and body size of the largest extant amphibian? More than the temperature-size rule.",
      "abstract": "Declining body size is a universal ecological response to global warming in ectotherms. Ectotherms grow faster but mature at a smaller size at higher temperatures. This phenomenon is known as the temperature-size rule (TSR). However, we know little about the details of the relationship between temperature and size. Here, this issue was studied in the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), one of the largest extant amphibians and a flagship species of conservation in China. Warm-acclimated A. davidianus larvae (25 °C) had accelerated development but little superiority in body growth when compared to their 15 °C counterparts when fed with red worm. This predicts a drastic decrease in adult body size with warming. However, a fish diet (more abundant lipid and protein) improved the growth performance at 25 °C. The underlying mechanism was studied. Warm-acclimated larvae had enlarged livers but shortened tails (fat depot). Their livers suffered from energy deficiencies and decreased protein levels, even when protein synthesis and energy metabolism were transcriptionally upregulated. This could be a direct explanation for their poor growth performance. Further analyses revealed a metabolic disorder resembling mammal glycogen storage disease in warm-acclimated larvae, indicating deficiency in glycogen catabolism. This speculation is consistent with their increased lipid and amino acid catabolism and explained the poor energy conditions of the warm-acclimated larvae. Additionally, a deficiency in glycogen metabolism explains the different efficiency of worm and fish diets in supporting the growth of warm-acclimated larvae, even when both diets were provided sufficiently. In conclusion, our results suggest that the relationship between temperature and body size can be flexible, which is a significant finding in terms of the TSR. The underlying metabolic and nutrient mechanisms were revealed. This knowledge can help deepen our understanding of the consequences of warming and can contribute to the conservation of A. davidianus.",

      "abstract": "Climate change has already had wide-ranging effects on populations, including shifts in species' ranges, phenology, and body size. Whereas some common patterns have emerged, the direction and magnitude of responses vary extensively among populations as well as across life stages within populations. Understanding the consequences of climate change and predicting future responses at the population level require experimental tests of how warmer temperatures affect life history traits, including growth rate, development time, and reproductive output. Here, we tested how experimental warming affected life history from larval development and survival to adult reproductive maturity and investment in mole salamanders, Ambystoma talpoideum. We found that a small temperature increase (~1°C) experienced during larval development had complex consequences: density-dependent effects on growth and body mass, density-independent effects on fat storage, and no effects on survival and reproductive investment. Although warming reduced growth rates, size at maturity, and fat storage, salamanders in both warmed and control conditions had similar survival and reproductive investment in their first year. However, costs of smaller body size and lower fat reserves may limit overwintering survival and/or future reproduction. Our study highlights the differential effects of warming across life history traits and multifaceted population responses to climate change. This work motivates future studies to examine variation in response to climate change across life stages and life history traits.",

      "abstract": "Body size reduction is a universal response to warming, but its ecological consequences across biological levels, from individuals to ecosystems, remain poorly understood. Most biological processes scale with body size, and warming-induced changes in body size can therefore have important ecological consequences. To understand these consequences, we propose a unifying, hierarchical framework for the ecological impacts of intraspecific body size reductions due to thermal plasticity that explicitly builds on three key pathways: morphological constraints, bioenergetic constraints and surface-to-volume ratio. Using this framework, we synthesize key consequences of warming-induced body size reductions at multiple levels of biological organization. We outline how this trait-based framework can improve our understanding, detection and generalization of the ecological impacts of warming.",

      "abstract": "Environmental pollution, accounting for both chemical and physical factors, is a major matter of concern due to its health consequences in both humans and animals. The release of greenhouse gases with the consequent increase in environmental temperature is acknowledged to have a major impact on the health of both animals and humans, in current and future generations. A large amount of evidence reports detrimental effects of acute heat stress on testis function, particularly on the spermatogenetic and steroidogenetic process, in both animal and human models, wich is largely related to the testis placement within the scrotal sac and outside the abdomen, warranting an overall scrotal temperature of 2°C-4°C lower than the core body temperature. This review will provide a thorough evaluation of environmental temperature's effect on testicular function. In particular, basic concepts of body thermoregulation will be discussed together with available data about the association between testis damage and heat stress exposure. In addition, the possible association between global warming and the secular decline of testis function will be critically evaluated in light of the available epidemiological studies.",

It is time for developed nations to commit to red meat reduction targets and shift to plant-based dietary patterns. Transitioning to plant-based diets (PBDs) has the potential to reduce diet-related land use by 76%, diet-related greenhouse gas emissions by 49%, eutrophication by 49%, and green and blue water use by 21% and 14%, respectively, whilst garnering substantial health co-benefits. An extensive body of data from prospective cohort studies and controlled trials supports the implementation of PBDs for obesity and chronic disease prevention. The consumption of diets high in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, fish, and unsaturated vegetable oils, and low in animal products, refined grains, and added sugars are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. Meat appreciation, health concerns, convenience, and expense are prominent barriers to PBDs. Strategic policy action is required to overcome these barriers and promote the implementation of healthy and sustainable PBDs.",

      "abstract": "Heat stress has far-reaching ramifications for agricultural production and the severity of its impact has increased alongside the growing threats of global warming. Climate change is exacerbating the already-severe consequences of seasonal heat stress and is predicted to cause additional losses in reproductive performance, milk production and overall productivity. Estimated and predicted losses are staggering, and without advancement in production practices during heat stress, these projected losses will threaten the human food supply. This is particularly concerning as the worldwide population and, thus, demand for animal products grows. As such, there is an urgent need for the development of technologies and management strategies capable of improving animal production capacity and efficiency during periods of heat stress. Reproduction is a major component of animal productivity, and subfertility during thermal stress is ultimately the result of both reproductive and whole-body physiological responses to heat stress. Improving reproductive performance during seasonal heat stress requires a thorough understanding of its effects on the reproductive system as well as other physiological systems involved in the whole-body response to elevated ambient temperature. To that end, this review will explore the reproductive repercussions of whole-body consequences of heat stress, including elevated body temperature, altered metabolism and circulating lipopolysaccharide. A comprehensive understanding of the physiological responses to heat stress is a prerequisite for improving fertility, and thus, the overall productivity of dairy cattle experiencing heat stress.",

      "abstract": "Societal concern about climate change and global warming has grown worldwide along with the concomitant awareness that health will be impacted deeply. Among living beings, humans have quite large capacities for adaptation to varied temperature conditions. Despite their tropical origin, they live under all Earth climates, such as polar, temperate, altitude, arid, and tropical climates, using a wide range of behavioral and physiological adaptive responses. We address the adaptive abilities of human sleep-wake regulation and its interplay with thermoregulation under different natural climates. Sleep represents one-third of our living time and is also a major determinant of morbidity and mortality; shortening sleep duration increases mortality and multimorbidity. In addition, major advances in sleep neurology have occurred in the last decades. Some have been extensively reviewed, notably comparative sleep physiology among animals, allowing one to hypothesize about the functions of the different sleep states, as well as their relation to cognitive neuroscience or body biorhythms. However, the question of the sleep adaptive capacity of humans to global warming has barely been addressed. We examine \"normal\" sleep and thermoregulation in young adults residing in temperate conditions. We then review the sleep and thermoregulatory reactions under various climatic conditions, demonstrating the role of sleep changes as potent adaptive responses to living under natural hot climatic conditions. As a result, we show that humans are well-equipped to adapt to severe climates.",

      "abstract": "Global warming can alter size distributions of animal communities, but the contribution of size shifts within versus between species to such changes remains unknown. In particular, it is unclear if expected body size shrinkage in response to warming, observed at the interspecific level, can be used to infer similar size shifts within species. In this study, we compare warming effects on interspecific (relative species abundance) versus intraspecific (relative stage abundance) size structure of competing consumers by analyzing stage-structured bioenergetic food web models consisting of one or two consumer species and two resources, parameterized for pelagic plankton. Varying composition and temperature and body size dependencies in these models, we predicted interspecific versus intraspecific size structure across temperature. We found that warming shifted community size structure toward dominance of smaller species, in line with empirical evidence summarized in our review of 136 literature studies. However, this result emerged only given a size-temperature interaction favoring small over large individuals in warm environments. In contrast, the same mechanism caused an intraspecific shift toward dominance of larger (adult) stages, reconciling disparate observations of size responses within and across zooplankton species in the literature. As the empirical evidence for warming-driven stage shifts is scarce and equivocal, we call for more experimental studies on intraspecific size changes with warming. Understanding the global warming impacts on animal communities requires that we consider and quantify the relative importance of mechanisms concurrently shaping size distributions within and among species.",

      "abstract": "Personal thermal management (PTM) is a promising approach for maintaining the thermal comfort zone of the human body while minimizing the energy consumption of indoor buildings. Recent studies have reported the development of numerous advanced textiles that enable PTM systems to regulate body temperature and are comfortable to wear. Herein, recent advancements in thermoregulatory clothing for PTM are discussed. These advances in thermoregulatory clothing have focused on enhancing the control of heat dissipation between the skin and the localized environment. We primarily summarize research on advanced clothing that controls the heat dissipation pathways of the human body, such as radiation- and conductance-controlled clothing. Furthermore, adaptive clothing such as dual-mode textiles, which can regulate the microclimate of the human body, as well as responsive textiles that address both thermal performance (warming and/or cooling) and wearability are discussed. Finally, we include a discussion on significant challenges and perspectives in this field, including large-scale production, smart textiles, bioinspired clothing, and AI-assisted clothing. This comprehensive review aims to further the development of sustainably manufactured advanced clothing with superior thermal performance and outstanding wearability for PTM in practical applications.",

We hypothesized that enhancing body heat loss by periocular skin warming would reduce sleep onset and improve sleep quality. Eighteen healthy volunteers were asked to maintain wakefulness with their eyes closed for 60 min after applying either a warming or sham eye mask, followed by a 60-min sleep period. Compared to the sham, periocular warming increased the distal skin temperature and distal-proximal skin temperature gradient only during the 30-min thermal manipulation period. In the subsequent sleep period, periocular warming facilitated sleep onset, increased stage 2 sleep and electroencephalographic delta activity during the first half of the sleep period relative to the sham. These results suggest that periocular skin warming may accelerate and deepen sleep by enhancing physiological heat loss via the distal skin, mimicking physiological conditions preceding habitual sleep.",

      "abstract": "Movement facilitates and alters species interactions, the resulting food web structures, species distribution patterns, community structures and survival of populations and communities. In the light of global change, it is crucial to gain a general understanding of how movement depends on traits and environmental conditions. Although insects and notably Coleoptera represent the largest and a functionally important taxonomic group, we still know little about their general movement capacities and how they respond to warming. Here, we measured the exploratory speed of 125 individuals of eight carabid beetle species across different temperatures and body masses using automated image-based tracking. The resulting data revealed a power-law scaling relationship of average movement speed with body mass. By additionally fitting a thermal performance curve to the data, we accounted for the unimodal temperature response of movement speed. Thereby, we yielded a general allometric and thermodynamic equation to predict exploratory speed from temperature and body mass. This equation predicting temperature-dependent movement speed can be incorporated into modeling approaches to predict trophic interactions or spatial movement patterns. Overall, these findings will help improve our understanding of how temperature effects on movement cascade from small to large spatial scales as well as from individual to population fitness and survival across communities.",

      "abstract": "To appreciate the strategy of prewarming, perioperative personnel should have a basic understanding of the physics of heat transfer and the thermoregulatory pathophysiology of anesthesia. The dominant cause of postinduction hypothermia is anesthesia-related redistribution of heat within the body; the role of cutaneous heat loss is minimal. Physiologic thermoregulatory system changes that occur in response to anesthesia make it almost impossible to reverse intraoperative hypothermia. However, prewarming is an effective strategy to prevent postinduction hypothermia from redistribution because it creates a temporary excess of heat in the body's peripheral thermal compartment. Perioperative nurses should implement active and passive prewarming strategies in accordance with the warming devices at their facility and available time. This article focuses on two major topics necessary to understand prewarming: the effect of anesthesia on postinduction thermoregulation and thermodynamic conditions that successful treatment strategies must exploit to produce desired outcomes.",

WSNs increase their action potential firing rates upon warming, a property that has been presumed to rely on the composition of thermosensitive ion channels within WSNs. Here, we describe a synaptic mechanism that regulates temperature sensitivity of preoptic WSNs and body temperature. Experimentally induced warming of the mouse hypothalamic preoptic area in vivo triggers body cooling. TRPM2 ion channels facilitate this homeostatic response and, at the cellular level, enhance temperature responses of WSNs, thereby linking WSN function with thermoregulation for the first time. Rather than acting within WSNs, we-unexpectedly-find TRPM2 to temperature-dependently increase synaptic drive onto WSNs by disinhibition. Our data emphasize a network-based interoceptive paradigm that likely plays a key role in encoding body temperature and that may facilitate integration of diverse inputs into thermoregulatory pathways.",

      "abstract": "Bee populations are exposed to multiple stressors, including land-use change, biological invasions, climate change, and pesticide exposure, that may interact synergistically. We analyze the combined effects of climate warming and sublethal insecticide exposure in the solitary bee Osmia cornuta. Previous Osmia studies show that warm wintering temperatures cause body weight loss, lipid consumption, and fat body depletion. Because the fat body plays a key role in xenobiotic detoxification, we expected that bees exposed to climate warming scenarios would be more sensitive to pesticides. We exposed O. cornuta females to three wintering treatments: current scenario (2007-2012 temperatures), near-future (2021-2050 projected temperatures), and distant-future (2051-2080). Upon emergence in spring, bees were orally exposed to three sublethal doses of an insecticide (Closer, a.i. sulfoxaflor; 0, 4.55 and 11.64 ng a.i./bee). We measured the combined effects of wintering and insecticide exposure on phototactic response, syrup consumption, and longevity. Wintering treatment by itself did not affect winter mortality, but body weight loss increased with increasing wintering temperatures. Similarly, wintering treatment by itself hardly influenced phototactic response or syrup consumption. However, bees wintered at the warmest temperatures had shorter longevity, a strong fecundity predictor in Osmia. Insecticide exposure, especially at the high dose, impaired the ability of bees to respond to light, and resulted in reduced syrup consumption and longevity. The combination of the warmest winter and the high insecticide dose resulted in a 70% longevity decrease. Smaller bees, resulting from smaller pollen-nectar provisions, had shorter longevity suggesting nutritional stress may further compromise fecundity in O. cornuta. Our results show a synergistic interaction between two major drivers of bee declines, and indicate that bees will become more sensitive to pesticides under the current global warming scenario. Our findings have important implications for pesticide regulation and underscore the need to consider multiple stressors to understand bee declines.",

      "abstract": "Human body core temperature is tightly regulated within approximately 37 °C. Global near surface temperature has increased by over 1.2 °C between 1850 and 2020. In light of the challenge this poses to human thermoregulation, the present perspective article sought to provide an overview on the effects of varying ambient and body temperature on cognitive, affective, and behavioural domains of functioning. To this end, an overview of observational and experimental studies in healthy individuals and individuals with mental disorders was provided. Within body core temperature at approximately 37 °C, relatively lower ambient and skin temperatures appear to evoke a need for social connection, whereas comparably higher temperatures appear to facilitate notions of other as closer and more sociable. Above-average ambient temperatures are associated with increased conflicts as well as incident psychotic and depressive symptoms, mental disorders, and suicide. With mild hypo- and hyperthermia, paradoxical effects are observed: whereas the acute states are generally characterised by impairments in cognitive performance, anxiety, and irritability, individuals with depression experience longer-term symptom improvements with treatments deliberately inducing these states for brief amounts of time. When taken together, it has thus become clear that temperature is inexorably associated with human cognition, affect, and (potentially) behaviour. Given the projected increase in global warming, further research into the affective and behavioural sequelae of heat and the mechanisms translating it into mental health outcomes is urgently warranted.",

      "abstract": "Locusts differ from ordinary grasshoppers in their ability to swarm over long distances and are among the oldest migratory pests. The ecology and biology of locusts make them among the most devastating pests worldwide and hence the calls for actions to prevent the next outbreaks. The most destructive of all locust species is the desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria). Here, we review the current locust epidemic 2020 outbreak and its causes and prevention including the green technologies that may provide a reference for future directions of locust control and food security. Massive locust outbreaks threaten the terrestrial environments and crop production in around 100 countries of which Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya are the most affected. Six large locust outbreaks are reported for the period from 1912 to 1989 all being closely related to long-term droughts and warm winters coupled with occurrence of high precipitation in spring and summer. The outbreaks in East Africa, India and Pakistan are the most pronounced with locusts migrating more than 150 km/day during which the locusts consume food equivalent to their own body weight on a daily basis. The plague heavily affects the agricultural sectors, which is the foundation of national economies and social stability. Global warming is likely the main cause of locust plague outbreak in recent decades driving egg spawning of up to 2-400,000 eggs per square meter. Biological control techniques such as microorganisms, insects and birds help to reduce the outbreaks while reducing ecosystem and agricultural impacts. In addition, green technologies such as light and sound stimulation seem to work, however, these are challenging and need further technological development incorporating remote sensing and modelling before they are applicable on large-scales. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the 2020 locust outbreak is the worst in 70 years probably triggered by climate change, hurricanes and heavy rain and has affected a total of 70,000 ha in Somalia and Ethiopia. There is a need for shifting towards soybean, rape, and watermelon which seems to help to prevent locust outbreaks and obtain food security. Furthermore, locusts have a very high protein content and is an excellent protein source for meat production and as an alternative human protein source, which should be used to mitigate food security. In addition, forestation of arable land improves local climate conditions towards less precipitation and lower temperatures while simultaneously attracting a larger number of birds thereby increasing the locust predation rates.",

      "abstract": "Human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, as membrane-bound hemoproteins, play important roles in the detoxification of drugs, cellular metabolism, and homeostasis. In humans, almost 80% of oxidative metabolism and approximately 50% of the overall elimination of common clinical drugs can be attributed to one or more of the various CYPs, from the CYP families 1-3. In addition to the basic metabolic effects for elimination, CYPs are also capable of affecting drug responses by influencing drug action, safety, bioavailability, and drug resistance through metabolism, in both metabolic organs and local sites of action. Structures of CYPs have recently provided new insights into both understanding the mechanisms of drug metabolism and exploiting CYPs as drug targets. Genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in CYP genes and environmental factors may be responsible for interethnic and interindividual variations in the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. In this review, we summarize and highlight the structural knowledge about CYPs and the major CYPs in drug metabolism. Additionally, genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as several intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to interindividual variation in drug response are also reviewed, to reveal the multifarious and important roles of CYP-mediated metabolism and elimination in drug therapy.",

      "abstract": "The gut microbiota and diet-induced changes in microbiome composition have been linked to various liver diseases, although the specific microbes and mechanisms remain understudied. Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is one such disease with limited therapeutic options due to its complex pathogenesis. We demonstrate that a diet rich in soluble dietary fiber increases the abundance of Bacteroides acidifaciens (B. acidifaciens) and alleviates alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. B. acidifaciens treatment alone ameliorates liver injury through a bile salt hydrolase that generates unconjugated bile acids to activate intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and its downstream target, fibroblast growth factor-15 (FGF15). FGF15 promotes hepatocyte expression of ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), which facilitates the metabolism of accumulated ornithine in the liver into glutamate, thereby providing sufficient glutamate for ammonia detoxification via the glutamine synthesis pathway. Collectively, these findings uncover a potential therapeutic strategy for ALD involving dietary fiber supplementation and B. acidifaciens.",

To mechanistically understand these relationships, here we map interactions between ∼150 small-molecule dietary xenobiotics and the gut microbiome, including the impacts of these compounds on community composition, the metabolic activities of human gut microbes on dietary xenobiotics, and interindividual variation in these traits. Microbial metabolism can toxify and detoxify these compounds, producing emergent interactions that explain community-specific remodeling by dietary xenobiotics. We identify the gene and enzyme responsible for detoxification of one such dietary xenobiotic, resveratrol, and demonstrate that this enzyme contributes to interindividual variation in community remodeling by resveratrol. Together, these results systematically map interactions between dietary xenobiotics and the gut microbiome and connect toxification and detoxification to interpersonal differences in microbiome response to diet.",

      "abstract": "Conclusions from previously reported articles have revealed that many commonly used pharmaceutical excipients, known to be pharmacologically inert, show effects on drug transporters and/or metabolic enzymes. Thus, the pharmacokinetics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) of active pharmaceutical ingredients are possibly altered because of their transport and metabolism modulation from the incorporated excipients. The aim of this review is to present studies on the interaction of various commonly-used excipients on pre-systemic metabolism by CYP450 enzymes. Excipients such as surfactants, polymers, fatty acids and solvents are discussed. Based on all the reported outcomes, the most potent inhibitors were found to be surfactants and the least effective were organic solvents. However, there are many factors that can influence the inhibition of CYP450, for instance type of excipient, concentration of excipient, type of CYP450 isoenzyme, incubation condition, etc. Such evidence will be very useful in dosage form design, so that the right formulation can be designed to maximize drug bioavailability, especially for poorly bioavailable drugs.",

Here we show that the Hippo pathway plays a critical role in regulating heavy metal homeostasis. Hippo signalling deficiency promotes the transcription of heavy metal response genes and protects cells from heavy metal-induced toxicity, a process independent of its classic downstream effectors YAP and TAZ. Mechanistically, the Hippo pathway kinase LATS phosphorylates and inhibits MTF1, an essential transcription factor in the heavy metal response, resulting in the loss of heavy metal response gene transcription and cellular protection. Moreover, LATS activity is inhibited following heavy metal treatment, where accumulated zinc directly binds and inhibits LATS. Together, our study reveals an interplay between the Hippo pathway and heavy metals, providing insights into this growth-related pathway in tissue homeostasis and stress response.",

The liver is considered as the principal site for the detoxification of ethanol metabolite, acetaldehyde (AcH), by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) and as a target for AUD treatment, however, our recent data indicate that the liver only plays a partial role in clearing systemic AcH. Here we show that a liver-gut axis, rather than liver alone, synergistically drives systemic AcH clearance and voluntary alcohol drinking. Mechanistically, we find that after ethanol intake, a substantial proportion of AcH generated in the liver is excreted via the bile into the gastrointestinal tract where AcH is further metabolized by gut ALDH2. Modulating bile flow significantly affects serum AcH level and drinking behaviour. Thus, combined targeting of liver and gut ALDH2, and manipulation of bile flow and secretion are potential therapeutic strategies to treat AUD.",

      "abstract": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are the main phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes mediating the most extensive glucuronidation-binding reaction in the human body. The UGT1A family is involved in more than half of glucuronidation reactions. However, significant differences exist in the distribution of UGT1As in vivo and the expression of UGT1As among individuals, and these differences are related to the occurrence of disease and differences in metabolism. In addition to genetic polymorphisms, there is now interest in the contribution of epigenetics and noncoding RNAs (especially miRNAs) to this differential change. Epigenetics regulates UGT1As pretranscriptionally through DNA methylation and histone modification, and miRNAs are considered the key mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation of UGT1As. Both epigenetic inheritance and miRNAs are involved in the differences in sex expression and in vivo distribution of UGT1As. Moreover, epigenetic changes early in life have been shown to affect gene expression throughout life. Here, we review and summarize the current regulatory role of epigenetics in the UGT1A family and discuss the relationship among epigenetics and UGT1A-related diseases and treatment, with references for future research.",

      "abstract": "During the last two decades, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1I3) has emerged as a master activator of drug- and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that govern the clearance of both exogenous and endogenous small molecules. Recent studies indicate that CAR participates, together with other nuclear receptors (NRs) and transcription factors, in regulation of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, hepatocyte communication, proliferation and toxicity, and liver tumor development in rodents. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) constitute a wide range of persistent organic compounds that have been associated with aberrations of hormone-dependent physiological processes. Their adverse health effects include metabolic alterations such as diabetes, obesity, and fatty liver disease in animal models and humans exposed to EDCs. As numerous xenobiotics can activate CAR, its role in EDC-elicited adverse metabolic effects has gained much interest. Here, we review the key features and mechanisms of CAR as a xenobiotic-sensing receptor, species differences and selectivity of CAR ligands, contribution of CAR to regulation hepatic metabolism, and evidence for CAR-dependent EDC action therein.",

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have identified some consistent disease-associated microbial features, leading to the emerging concept of microbiome-based therapeutics. However, it is also becoming clear that there are considerable variations in the microbiota among patients with the same disease. Variations in the microbial composition and function contribute to substantial differences in metabolic status of the host via production of a myriad of biochemically and functionally different microbial metabolites. Indeed, compelling evidence indicates that individuality of the microbiome may result in individualized responses to microbiome-based therapeutics and other interventions. Mechanistic understanding of the role of the microbiota in diseases and drug metabolism would help us to identify causal relationships and thus guide the development of microbiome-based precision or personalized medicine. In this review, we provide an overview of current efforts to use microbiome-based interventions for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and diabetes to approach precision medicine.",

In this Review, we summarize the major environmental pollutants that are attracting wide-ranging concern and the molecular basis underlying their effects on the immune system. Xenobiotic receptors, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), sense and respond to a subset of environmental pollutants by activating the expression of detoxification enzymes to protect the body. However, chronic activation of the AHR leads to immunotoxicity. KEAP1-NRF2 is another important system that protects the body against environmental pollutants. KEAP1 is a sensor protein that detects environmental pollutants, leading to activation of the transcription factor NRF2. NRF2 protects the body from immunotoxicity by inducing the expression of genes involved in detoxification, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Intervening in these sensor-response systems could protect the body from the devastating immunotoxicity that can be induced by environmental pollutants.",

      "abstract": "Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy, and the interactome of DMEs has attracted extensive attention. There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types. Because of the huge amount of accumulated data, the INTEDE made it possible to generalize key features for revealing disease etiology and optimizing clinical treatment. INTEDE is freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/intede/.",

This is part of the research and educational discipline ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination, and toxicity). Here, we review the work of Jan Commandeur and colleagues who have not only made a significant impact in understanding of phase I and phase II metabolism of several important compounds but also contributed greatly to the development of experimental techniques for the study of xenobiotic metabolism. Jan Commandeur's work has covered a broad area of research, such as the development of online screening methodologies, the use of a combination of enzyme mutagenesis and molecular modeling for structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, and the development of novel probe substrates. This work is the bedrock of current activities and brings the field closer to personalized (cohort-based) pharmacology, toxicology, and hazard/risk assessment.",

PXR is widely expressed in normal and malignant tissues. Drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters are also under PXR's regulation.

Various PXR polymorphisms may alter the function of the protein and are linked with significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents and clinical outcome variability. The purpose of this review is to summarize the roles of PXR polymorphisms in the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic drugs.

      "abstract": "The complex enzyme kinetics displayed by drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) (see Chapter 9 ) can, in part, be explained by an examination of their crystallographic protein structures. Fortunately, despite low sequence similarity between different families of drug-metabolizing CYPs, there exists a high degree of structural homology within the superfamily. This similarity in the protein fold allows for a direct comparison of the structural features of CYPs that contribute toward differences in substrate binding, heterotropic and homotropic cooperativity, and genetic variability in drug metabolism. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the nomenclature and the role of structural features that are common in all CYPs. We then apply these definitions to understand the different substrate specificities and functions in the CYP3A, CYP2C, and CYP2D families of enzymes.",

      "abstract": "The determination of mycotoxins content in food is not sufficient for the prediction of their potential in vivo cytotoxicity because it does not reflect their bioavailability and mutual interactions within complex matrices, which may significantly alter the toxic effects. Moreover, many mycotoxins undergo biotransformation and metabolization during the intestinal absorption process. Biotransformation is predominantly the conversion of mycotoxins meditated by cytochrome P450 and other enzymes. This should transform the toxins to nontoxic metabolites but it may possibly result in unexpectedly high toxicity. Therefore, the verification of biotransformation and bioavailability provides valuable information to correctly interpret occurrence data and biomonitoring results. Among all of the methods available, the in vitro models using monolayer formed by epithelial cells from the human colon (Caco-2 cell) have been extensively used for evaluating the permeability, bioavailability, intestinal transport, and metabolism of toxic and biologically active compounds. Here, the strengths and limitations of both in vivo and in vitro techniques used to determine bioavailability are reviewed, along with current detailed data about biotransformation of mycotoxins. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of mycotoxin effects is also discussed regarding the disorder of intestinal barrier integrity induced by mycotoxins.",

      "abstract": "The major determinants of drug or, al bioavailability are absorption and metabolism in the digestive tract. Genetic variations can cause significant differences in transporter and enzyme protein expression and function. The racial distribution of selected efflux transporter (i.e., Pgp, BCRP, MRP2) and metabolism enzyme (i.e., UGT1A1, UGT1A8) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly expressed in the digestive tract are reviewed in this paper with emphasis on the allele frequency and the impact on drug absorption, metabolism, and in vivo drug exposure. Additionally, preclinical and clinical models used to study the impact of transporter/enzyme SNPs on protein expression and function are also reviewed. The results showed that allele frequency of the major drug efflux transporters and the major intestinal metabolic enzymes are highly different in different races, leading to different drug disposition and exposure. The conclusion is that genetic polymorphism is frequently observed in different races and the related protein expression and drug absorption/metabolism function and drug in vivo exposure can be significantly affected, resulting in variations in drug response. Basic research on race-dependent drug absorption/metabolism is expected, and FDA regulations of drug dosing adjustment based on racial disparity are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Several recent studies have shown that citric acid/citrate (CA) can confer abiotic stress tolerance to plants. Exogenous CA application leads to improved growth and yield in crop plants under various abiotic stress conditions. Improved physiological outcomes are associated with higher photosynthetic rates, reduced reactive oxygen species, and better osmoregulation. Application of CA also induces antioxidant defense systems, promotes increased chlorophyll content, and affects secondary metabolism to limit plant growth restrictions under stress. In particular, CA has a major impact on relieving heavy metal stress by promoting precipitation, chelation, and sequestration of metal ions. This review summarizes the mechanisms that mediate CA-regulated changes in plants, primarily CA's involvement in the control of physiological and molecular processes in plants under abiotic stress conditions. We also review genetic engineering strategies for CA-mediated abiotic stress tolerance. Finally, we propose a model to explain how CA's position in complex metabolic networks involving the biosynthesis of phytohormones, amino acids, signaling molecules, and other secondary metabolites could explain some of its abiotic stress-ameliorating properties. This review summarizes our current understanding of CA-mediated abiotic stress tolerance and highlights areas where additional research is needed.",

      "abstract": "Critical aspects of physiology and cell function exhibit self-sustained ~24-hour variations termed circadian rhythms. In the liver, circadian rhythms play fundamental roles in maintaining organ homeostasis. Here, we established and characterized an in vitro liver experimental system in which primary human hepatocytes display self-sustained oscillations. By generating gene expression profiles of these hepatocytes over time, we demonstrated that their transcriptional state is dynamic across 24 hours and identified a set of cycling genes with functions related to inflammation, drug metabolism, and energy homeostasis. We designed and tested a treatment protocol to minimize atorvastatin- and acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. Last, we documented circadian-dependent induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines when triggered by LPS, IFN-β, or ",

      "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) exerts a toxic influence on numerous crucial growth and development processes in plants, notably affecting seed germination rate, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, and biomass. While considerable advances in Cd uptake and detoxification of plants have been made, the mechanisms by which plants adapt to and tolerate Cd toxicity remain elusive. This review focuses on the relationship between Cd and plants and the prospects for phytoremediation of Cd pollution. We highlight the following issues: (1) the present state of Cd pollution and its associated hazards, encompassing the sources and distribution of Cd and the risks posed to human health; (2) the mechanisms underlying the uptake and transport of Cd, including the physiological processes associated with the uptake, translocation, and detoxification of Cd, as well as the pertinent gene families implicated in these processes; (3) the detrimental effects of Cd on plants and the mechanisms of detoxification, such as the activation of resistance genes, root chelation, vacuolar compartmentalization, the activation of antioxidant systems and the generation of non-enzymatic antioxidants; (4) the practical application of phytoremediation and the impact of incorporating exogenous substances on the Cd tolerance of plants.",

The purpose of this review is to summarize scientific publications on arthropod P450s from major insect and mite agricultural pests, pollinators and Papilio sp, which have been functionally characterized and shown to metabolize xenobiotics and/or their role (direct or indirect) in pesticide toxicity or resistance has been functionally validated. The phylogenetic relationships among these P450s, the functional systems employed for their characterization and their xenobiotic catalytic properties are presented, in a systematic approach, including critical aspects and limitations. The potential of the primary P450-based metabolic pathway of target and non-target organisms for the development of highly selective insecticides and resistance-breaking formulations may help to improve the efficiency and sustainability of pest control.",

Tools commonly used to study the human liver metabolism include hepatocyte cell lines, primary human hepatocytes, and pluripotent stem cells-derived hepatocytes in vitro, and liver genetically humanized mouse model in vivo. However, none of these systems can mimic the human liver in physiological and pathological states satisfactorily. Liver-humanized mice, which are established by reconstituting mouse liver with human hepatocytes, have emerged as an attractive animal model to study drug metabolism and evaluate the therapeutic effect in \"human liver\" in vivo because the humanized livers greatly replicate enzymatic features of human hepatocytes. The application of liver-humanized mice in studying metabolic disorders is relatively less common due to the largely uncertain replication of metabolic profiles compared to humans. Here, we summarize the metabolic characteristics and current application of liver-humanized mouse models in metabolic disorders that have been reported in the literature, trying to evaluate the pros and cons of using liver-humanized mice as novel mouse models to study metabolic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Deoxynivalenol (DON) is the most abundant mycotoxin in cereal crops and derived foods and is of great concern in agriculture. Bioremediation strategies have long been sought to minimize the impact of mycotoxin contamination, but few direct and effective enzyme-catalyzed detoxification methods are currently available. In this study, we established a multi-enzymatic cascade reaction and successfully achieved detoxification at double sites: glutathionylation for the C-12,13 epoxide group and epimerization for the C-3 hydroxyl group. This yielded novel derivatives of DON, 3-epi-DON-13-glutathione (3-epi-DON-13-GSH) as well as its by-product, 3-keto-DON-13-GSH, for which precise structures were validated via liquid chromatography-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Both cell viability and DNA synthesis assays demonstrated dramatically decreased cytotoxicity of the double-site modified product 3-epi-DON-13-GSH. These findings provide a promising and urgently needed novel method for addressing the problem of DON contamination in agricultural and industrial settings.",

Plants have developed mechanisms aimed at regulating the level of the active form of these hormones, including their: directional transport, local biosynthesis, and degradation, as well as reversible and irreversible inactivation by binding to additional chemical groups. Despite almost a hundred years since the discovery of auxins, the functioning of these mechanisms, especially at the level of metabolism, is still not fully understood. In recent years, thanks to the development of new research methods, significant progress has been made in this field. This applies to both the identification of auxin biosynthetic pathways and the genes involved in them, as well as the detection of new auxin metabolites, their mutual connections and enzymes involved in their biosynthesis, transformation, and degradation. This work focuses on summarizing the current knowledge on this topic, considering the relationship of auxin metabolism with developmental processes and the response to changing environmental conditions.",

      "abstract": "Plant metabolites have a great potential for limiting the spread of harmful fungi. However, a better understanding of the mode-of-action of these molecules and the defense systems developed by fungi to resist them, is needed to assess the benefits/risks of using them as antifungal treatment. White-rot fungi are excellent models in this respect, as they have adapted to the hostile habitat that is wood. In fact, wood is a source of putative antifungal compounds that can be derived using extraction techniques. In this study, we demonstrated that esculin and esculetin, which are coumarins found in plants and wood, reduce the growth of the wood-rotting fungi Fomitiporia mediterranea, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pycnoporus cinnabarinus and Trametes versicolor. We have shown that extracellular strategies are developed by the fungi to deal with esculin, through the involvement of laccases, peroxidases and glycoside hydrolases, and intracellular strategies, mainly via upregulated protein translation. Comparative proteomic and metabolomic approaches revealed that, despite the fact that the species analysed are closely related (they all belong to the Agaricomycetes, and have the same trophic mode), their defense responses to esculin differ.",

They use cytochromes P450 (P450s) to detoxify tree-produced terpenes to produce pheromones, in de novo pheromone production and to oxidize odorants on antennae. Many Dendroctonus spp. use trans-verbenol as an aggregation pheromone, and it is formed from host-tree produced α-pinene hydroxylated by CYP6DE1 during larval stages, stored as verbenyl ester of fatty acids, and then released when the female begins feeding on a new host tree. Ips spp. hydroxylate de novo produced myrcene to form ipsdienol. Subsequent steps form the appropriate enantiomeric composition of ipsdienol and convert ipsdienol to ipsenol. In this article we review recent progress in elucidating the functions of P450s in Ips and Dendroctonus species and in doing so provide insights into the role of these enzymes in host phytochemical detoxification and pheromone production.",

      "abstract": "Drug development is a costly and lengthy process with low success rates. To improve the efficiency of drug development, there has been an increasing need in developing alternative methods able to eliminate toxic compounds early in the drug development pipeline. Drug metabolism plays a key role in determining the efficacy of a drug and its potential side effects. Since drug metabolism occurs mainly in the liver, liver cell-based alternative engineering platforms have been growing in the last decade. Microphysiological liver cell-based systems called liver-on-a-chip platforms can better recapitulate the environment for human liver cells in laboratory settings and have the potential to reduce the number of animal models used in drug development by predicting the response of the liver to a drug in vitro. In this review, we discuss the liver microphysiological platforms from the perspective of drug metabolism studies. We highlight the stand-alone liver-on-a-chip platforms and multi-organ systems integrating liver-on-a-chip devices used for drug metabolism mimicry in vitro and review the state-of-the-art platforms reported in the last few years. With the development of more robust and reproducible liver cell-based microphysiological platforms, the drug development field has the potential of reducing the costs and lengths associated with currently existing drug testing methods.",

However, it is toxic to some individuals, and the biological mechanisms causing toxicity are unknown. Limited literature is available on the role of glycine conjugation as the principal pathway in aspirin detoxification. Previous studies have quantified this two-step enzyme reaction as a singular enzymatic process. Consequently, the individual contributions of these enzymes to the kinetics remain unclear.",

      "abstract": "Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is characterised by non-specific and recurring symptoms affecting multiple organs and associated with exposure to chemicals, even at low concentrations, which are, under normal circumstances, harmless to the general population. Symptoms include general discomfort, cardiovascular instability, irritation of the sensory organs, breath disorders, hypersensitivity affecting the skin and epithelial lining of the gut, throat and lungs, anxiety, and learning and memory loss. Chemical intolerance is a key distinguishing feature of MCS, limiting considerably patients' lifestyle with serious social, occupational and economic implications. Since no specific diagnostic markers are currently available for chemical intolerance, the diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms. Despite the formulation of several hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology of MCS, its mechanisms remain undefined. A person-centred care approach, based on multidisciplinary and individualised medical plans, has shown promising results. However, more definite treatment strategies are required. We have reviewed the main experimental studies on MCS pathophysiology, focusing on the brain networks involved, the impact of environmental pollution on the olfactory system and the correlation with other pathologies such as neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we discuss treatment strategies targeting the olfactory system.",

      "abstract": "Type III secretion system effector proteins have primarily been characterized for their interactions with host cell proteins and their ability to disrupt host signaling pathways. We are testing the hypothesis that some effectors are active within the bacterium, where they modulate bacterial signal transduction and physiology. We previously determined that the Citrobacter rodentium effector NleB possesses an intra-bacterial glycosyltransferase activity that increases glutathione synthetase activity to protect the bacterium from oxidative stress. Here we investigated the potential intra-bacterial activities of NleB orthologs in Salmonella enterica and found that SseK1 and SseK3 mediate resistance to methylglyoxal. SseK1 glycosylates specific arginine residues on four proteins involved in methylglyoxal detoxification, namely GloA (R9), GloB (R190), GloC (R160), and YajL (R149). SseK1-mediated Arg-glycosylation of these four proteins significantly enhances their catalytic activity, thus providing another important example of the intra-bacterial activities of type three secretion system effector proteins. These data are also the first demonstration that a Salmonella T3SS effector is active within the bacterium.",

Today, scientists are especially interested in finding compounds that can help increase a healthy lifespan by detoxifying the body. Phytotherapy with specific approaches is used in alternative medicine to remove toxins from the body. Worldwide, research is conducted to identify medicinal plant-derived molecules that, with few or no side effects, may protect the liver and other organs.

      "abstract": "Neurotoxins pose significant challenges in defense and healthcare due to their disruptive effects on nervous tissues. Their extreme potency and enormous structural diversity have hindered the development of effective antidotes. Motivated by the properties of cell membrane-derived nanodiscs, such as their ultrasmall size, disc shape, and inherent cell membrane functions, here, we develop neuronal membrane-derived nanodiscs (denoted \"Neuron-NDs\") as a countermeasure nanomedicine for broad-spectrum neurotoxin detoxification. We fabricate Neuron-NDs using the plasma membrane of human SH-SY5Y neurons and demonstrate their effectiveness in detoxifying tetrodotoxin (TTX) and botulinum toxin (BoNT), two model toxins with distinct mechanisms of action. Cell-based assays confirm the ability of Neuron-NDs to inhibit TTX-induced ion channel blockage and BoNT-mediated inhibition of synaptic vesicle recycling. In mouse models of TTX and BoNT intoxication, treatment with Neuron-NDs effectively improves survival rates in both therapeutic and preventative settings. Importantly, high-dose administration of Neuron-NDs shows no observable acute toxicity in mice, indicating its safety profile. Overall, our study highlights the facile fabrication of Neuron-NDs and their broad-spectrum detoxification capabilities, offering promising solutions for neurotoxin-related challenges in biodefense and therapeutic applications.",

This review synthesizes epidemiological and clinical evidence from human studies elucidating the crucial role of detoxification impairment in AD and PD pathogenesis, complemented by mechanistic insights from preclinical models.

Targeted DMET proteomics that relies on synthetic stable isotope-labeled surrogate peptides as calibrators is routinely used for the quantification of selected proteins; however, the technique is limited to the quantification of a small number of proteins. Although the global proteomics-based total protein approach (TPA) is emerging as a better alternative for large-scale protein quantification, the conventional TPA does not consider differential sequence coverage by identifying unique peptides across proteins. Here, we optimized the TPA approach by correcting protein abundance data by the sequence coverage, which was applied to quantify 54 DMETs for characterization of 1) differential tissue DMET abundance in the human liver, kidney, and intestine, and 2) interindividual variability of DMET proteins in individual intestinal samples (",

Recent advances in sequencing, genome assembly, and phylogenetic methods have returned emphasis to the adaptive value of these enzymes in the context of herbivory. Comparisons of whole repertoires of P450s across related species reveal that P450s capable of metabolizing xenobiotics have an increased rate of gains compared to losses after gene duplications. In plants, studies have focused on enzymes and end-functions that have converged to provide increased resistance to herbivory. This review summarizes the latest findings related to the ecological value of P450s in the interactions between phytophagous insects and their host plants.",

      "abstract": "Mammalian carboxylesterases (CES), the key members of the serine hydrolase superfamily, hydrolyze a wide range of endogenous substances and xenobiotics bearing ester or amide bond(s). In humans, most of identified CES are segregated into the CES1A and CES2A subfamilies. Strong inhibition on human CES (including hCES1A and hCES2A) may modulate pharmacokinetic profiles of CES-substrate drugs, thereby changing the pharmacological and toxicological responses of these drugs. This review covered recent advances in discovery of hCES inhibitors from clinically available medications, as well as their impact on CES-associated drug metabolism. Three comprehensive lists of hCES inhibitors deriving from clinically available medications including therapeutic drugs, pharmaceutical excipients and herbal medicines, alongside with their inhibition potentials and inhibition parameters, are summarized. Furthermore, the potential risks of hCES inhibitors to trigger drug/herb-drug interactions (DDIs/HDIs) and future concerns in this field are highlighted. Potent hCES inhibitors may trigger clinically relevant DDIs/HDIs, especially when these inhibitors are co-administrated with CES substrate-drugs with very narrow therapeutic windows. All data and knowledge presented here provide key information for the clinicians to assess the risks of clinically available hCES inhibitors on drug metabolism. In future, more practical and highly specific substrates for hCES1A/hCES2A should be developed and used for studies on CES-mediated DDIs/HDIs both in vitro and in vivo.",

      "abstract": "The brain is supplied by an elaborate vascular network that originates extracranially and reaches deep into the brain. The concept of the neurovascular unit provides a useful framework to investigate how neuronal signals regulate nearby microvessels to support the metabolic needs of the brain, but it does not consider the role of larger cerebral arteries and systemic vasoactive signals. Furthermore, the recently emerged molecular heterogeneity of cerebrovascular cells indicates that there is no prototypical neurovascular unit replicated at all levels of the vascular network. Here, we examine the cellular and molecular diversity of the cerebrovascular tree and the relative contribution of systemic and brain-intrinsic factors to neurovascular function. Evidence supports the concept of a 'neurovascular complex' composed of segmentally diverse functional modules that implement coordinated vascular responses to central and peripheral signals to maintain homeostasis of the brain. This concept has major implications for neurovascular regulation in health and disease and for brain imaging.",

To accomplish this, static and dynamic indicators of fluid responsiveness have been widely studied.

      "abstract": "Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is commonly recognized as the consequence of coronary atherosclerosis and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). However, a significant number of patients may present angina or myocardial infarction even in the absence of any significant coronary artery stenosis and impairment of the coronary microcirculation has been increasingly implicated as a relevant cause of IHD. The term \"coronary microvascular dysfunction\" (CMD) encompasses several pathogenic mechanisms resulting in functional and/or structural changes in the coronary microcirculation and determining angina and myocardial ischemia in patients with angina without obstructive CAD (\"primary\" microvascular angina), as well as in several other conditions, including obstructive CAD, cardiomyopathies, Takotsubo syndrome and heart failure, especially the phenotype with preserved ejection fraction. The pathogenesis of CMD is complex and involves the combination of functional and structural alterations leading to impaired coronary blood flow and resulting in myocardial ischemia. In the absence of therapies specifically targeting CMD, attention has been focused on the role of modifiable risk factors. Here, we provide updated evidence regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CMD, with a particular focus on the role of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities. Moreover, we discuss the specific pathogenic mechanisms of CMD across the different cardiovascular diseases, aiming to pave the way for further research and the development of novel strategies for a precision medicine approach.",

Compared with high-load resistance training, mechanical load is markedly reduced with BFRT, but induces similar gains in muscle mass and strength. BFRT is thus an effective training strategy for people with physical limitations. Recent research indicates that BFRT has beneficial effects on glucose and mitochondrial metabolism. BFRT may therefore qualify as a valuable exercise alternative for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), a disorder characterized by impaired glucose metabolism, musculoskeletal decline, and exacerbated progression of sarcopenia. This review covers the effects of BFRT in healthy populations and in persons with impaired physical fitness, the mechanisms of action of this novel training modality, and possible applications for individuals with T2D.",

In the left oblique view, the artery appears coursing upward to the left. In the right oblique view, it courses anteriorly across the right ventricular outflow tract. The clinical significance of Vieussens' arterial ring lies in it being a major source of collateral blood flow to an occluded LAD.

Two main aims in acute stroke therapy include the restoration of cerebral blood flow in order to preserve energy supply to neurons and other brain cells, and minimizing neuronal loss.

As such, cerebral energy homeostasis is a key target in stroke therapy. The various articles in this special issue highlight energy metabolism changes following stroke, including disturbed cerebral blood circulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, programmed neuronal cell death and cell-cell communication in brain metabolism.

      "abstract": "Slow eating, which involves chewing food slowly and thoroughly, is an effective strategy for controlling appetite in order to avoid being overweight or obese. Slow eating also has the effect of increasing postprandial energy expenditure (diet-induced thermogenesis). It is still unclear whether this is due to oral stimuli; that is, the duration of tasting food in the mouth and the duration of chewing. To investigate the effects of oral stimuli on diet-induced thermogenesis in 11 healthy normal weight males, we conducted a randomized crossover study comprising three trials: (1) drinking liquid food normally, (2) drinking liquid food after tasting, and (3) adding chewing while tasting. Oral stimuli (i.e., the duration of tasting liquid food in the mouth and the duration of chewing) significantly increased diet-induced thermogenesis after drinking liquid food. This result demonstrates that the increase in diet-induced thermogenesis is due to oral stimuli rather than the influence of the food bolus. Increased diet-induced thermogenesis induced by chewing and taste stimuli may help to prevent overweight and obesity.",

      "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a significant and growing threat to human health, with increasing incidence. Promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis therapy (PBCRBS), a Traditional Chinese Medicine therapy, can be an adjuvant therapy to benefit patients with ICH by improving clinical efficacy. However, in theory, using PBCRBS to treat ICH carries the risk of hematoma enlargement and rebleeding, which has led to controversy over its application in ICH treatment. To demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of PBCRBS in treating ICH, this review first analyzes the pathological and physiological basis of ICH and secondly, the cascade of response after ICH and the involvement of cytokines and signaling pathways in this process. Finally, experimental and clinical studies on the treatment of ICH with PBCRBS over the past decade were retrieved from the PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, and the content of these studies was used to summarize commonly used herbs with PBCRBS effects and their mechanisms of action. Through analysis, hypertension has been identified as the most common cause of ICH. Heme, interleukin, reactive oxygen species, coagulation promoting particles and other induced mass effects, inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation cascade reactions lead to brain damage following ICH. This review includes 56 experimental studies and 83 clinical studies summarizing 28 commonly used herbs, demonstrating the positive impact of PBCRBS as an adjuvant therapy for ICH. In summary, PBCRBS appears effective and safe for treating ICH.",

The contemporary 3-dimensional scanner technology and the state-of-the-art MPI radionuclide tracers and pharmacological stress agents, as well as the cutting-edge image reconstruction techniques and data analysis software, have all enabled accurate, reliable and reproducible quantification of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF), and henceforth calculation of myocardial flow reserve (MFR) in several clinical scenarios. In patients with suspected coronary artery disease, both absolute stress MBF and MFR can identify myocardial territories subtended by epicardial coronary arteries with haemodynamically significant stenosis, as defined by invasive coronary fractional flow reserve measurement. In particular, absolute stress MBF and MFR offered incremental prognostic information for predicting adverse cardiac outcome, and hence for better patient risk stratification, over those provided by traditional clinical risk predictors. This article reviews the available evidence to support the translation of the current techniques and technologies into a useful decision-making tool in real-world clinical practice.",

Perhaps the major reason defects will appear fixed is that there is no absolute quantitative measurement of myocardial blood flow (MBF, rest and stress) with which to assess the magnitude and potential direction of change in the defect vs reference zone with stress. Cardiac PET MPI provides absolute measurements of MBF required to understand the clinical significance of the SPECT \"fixed\" defect and are highlighted.

      "abstract": "The function of the liver depends critically on its blood supply. Numerous in silico models have been developed to study various aspects of the hepatic circulation, including not only the macro-hemodynamics at the organ level, but also the microcirculation at the lobular level. In addition, computational models of blood flow and bile flow have been used to study the transport, metabolism, and clearance of drugs in pharmacokinetic studies. These in silico models aim to provide insights into the liver organ function under both healthy and diseased states, and to assist quantitative analysis for surgical planning and postsurgery treatment. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on state-of-the-art in silico models of the hepatic circulation and transport processes. We introduce the numerical methods and the physiological background of these models. We also discuss multiscale frameworks that have been proposed for the liver, and their linkage with the large context of systems biology, systems pharmacology, and the Physiome project.

      "abstract": "Blood flow in the human vascular system is a complex to understand example of fluid dynamics in a closed conduit. Any irregularities in the hemodynamics may lead to lethal cardiovascular disease like heart attack, heart failure and ischemia. Numerical simulation of hemodynamics in the blood vessel can facilitate a thorough understanding of blood flow and its interaction with the adjacent vessel wall. A good simulation approach for blood flow can be helpful in early prediction and diagnosis of the mentioned disease. The simulation outcomes may also provide decision support for surgical planning and medical implants. This study reports an extensive review of various approaches adopted to analyze the influence of blood rheological characteristics in a different class of blood vessels. In particular, emphasis was given on the identification of best possible rheological model to effectively solve the hemodynamics inside different blood vessels. The performance capability of different rheological models was discussed for different classes and conditions of vessels and the best/poor performing models are listed out. The Carreau, Casson and generalized power-law models were appeared to be superior for solving the blood flow at all shear rates. In contrast, power law, Walburn-Scheck and Herchel-Bulkley model lacks behind in the purpose.",

      "abstract": "The heart is widely acknowledged as the unique driver of blood circulation. Recently, we discovered a flow-driving mechanism that can operate without imposed pressure, using infrared (IR) energy to propel flow. We considered the possibility that, by exploiting this mechanism, blood vessels, themselves, could propel flow. We verified the existence of this driving mechanism by using a three-day-old chick-embryo model. When the heart was stopped, blood continued to flow for approximately 50 minutes, albeit at a lower velocity. When IR was introduced, the postmortem flow increased from ~41.1 ± 25.6 μm/s to ~153.0 ± 59.5 μm/s (n = 6). When IR energy was diminished under otherwise physiological conditions, blood failed to flow. Hence, this IR-dependent, vessel-based flow-driving mechanism may indeed operate in the circulatory system, complementing the action of the heart.",

Many imaging techniques have been applied to rodents in preclinical studies, to evaluate the magnitude of collateral blood flow and the time course of responses during the early phase of ischemic stroke. The collateral supply follows several different routes at the base of the brain (the circle of Willis) and its surface (leptomeningeal or pial arteries), corresponding to the proximal and distal collateral pathways, respectively. In this review, we describe and illustrate the cerebral collateral systems and their modifications following pre-Willis or post-Willis occlusion in rodents. We also review the potential pharmaceutical agents for stimulating the collateral blood supply tested to date. The time taken to establish a collateral blood flow supply through the leptomeningeal anastomoses differs between young and adult animals and between different species and genetic backgrounds. Caution is required when transposing preclinical findings to humans, and clinical trials must be performed to check the added value of pharmacological agents for stimulating the collateral blood supply at appropriate time points. However, collateral recruitment appears to be a rapid, beneficial, endogenous mechanism that can be stimulated shortly after artery occlusion. It should be considered a treatment target for use in addition to recanalization strategies.",

      "abstract": "Optimizing cerebral perfusion is key to rescuing salvageable ischemic brain tissue. Despite being an important determinant of cerebral perfusion, there are no effective guidelines for blood pressure (BP) management in acute stroke. The control of cerebral blood flow (CBF) involves a myriad of complex pathways which are largely unaccounted for in stroke management. Due to its unique anatomy and physiology, the cerebrovascular circulation is often treated as a stand-alone system rather than an integral component of the cardiovascular system. In order to optimize the strategies for BP management in acute ischemic stroke, a critical reappraisal of the mechanisms involved in CBF control is needed. In this review, we highlight the important role of collateral circulation and re-examine the pathophysiology of CBF control, namely the determinants of cerebral perfusion pressure gradient and resistance, in the context of stroke. Finally, we summarize the state of our knowledge regarding cardiovascular and cerebrovascular interaction and explore some potential avenues for future research in ischemic stroke.",

      "title": "Autonomic control of cerebral blood flow: fundamental comparisons between peripheral and cerebrovascular circulations in humans.",
      "abstract": "Understanding the contribution of the autonomic nervous system to cerebral blood flow (CBF) control is challenging, and interpretations are unclear. The identification of calcium channels and adrenoreceptors within cerebral vessels has led to common misconceptions that the function of these receptors and actions mirror those of the peripheral vasculature. This review outlines the fundamental differences and complex actions of cerebral autonomic activation compared with the peripheral circulation. Anatomical differences, including the closed nature of the cerebrovasculature, and differential adrenoreceptor subtypes, density, distribution and sensitivity, provide evidence that measures on peripheral sympathetic nerve activity cannot be extrapolated to the cerebrovasculature. Cerebral sympathetic nerve activity seems to act opposingly to the peripheral circulation, mediated at least in part by changes in intracranial pressure and cerebral blood volume. Additionally, heterogeneity in cerebral adrenoreceptor distribution highlights region-specific autonomic regulation of CBF. Compensatory chemo- and autoregulatory responses throughout the cerebral circulation, and interactions with parasympathetic nerve activity are unique features to the cerebral circulation. This crosstalk between sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes acts to ensure adequate perfusion of CBF to rising and falling perfusion pressures, optimizing delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, while attempting to maintain blood volume and intracranial pressure. Herein, we highlight the distinct similarities and differences between autonomic control of cerebral and peripheral blood flow, and the regional specificity of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation within the cerebrovasculature. Future research directions are outlined with the goal to further our understanding of autonomic control of CBF in humans.",

      "abstract": "Arterial collateralization, as determined by leptomeningeal anastomoses or pial collateral vessels, is a well-established vital player in cerebral blood flow restoration and neurological recovery from ischemic stroke. A secondary network of cerebral collateral circulation apart from the Circle of Willis, exist as remnants of arteriole development that connect the distal arteries in the pia mater. Recent interest lies in understanding the cellular and molecular adaptations that control the growth and remodeling, or arteriogenesis, of these pre-existing collateral vessels. New findings from both animal models and human studies of ischemic stroke suggest a multi-factorial and complex, temporospatial interplay of endothelium, immune and vessel-associated cell interactions may work in concert to facilitate or thwart arteriogenesis. These valuable reports may provide critical insight into potential predictors of the pial collateral response in patients with large vessel occlusion and may aid in therapeutics to enhance collateral function and improve recovery from stroke.

      "title": "Cerebral Microcirculation: Progress and Outlook of Laser Doppler Flowmetry in Neurosurgery and Neurointensive Care.",
      "abstract": "Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is a well-established technique for the investigation of tissue microcirculation. Compared to skin, the use in the human brain is sparse. The measurement of cerebral microcirculation in neurointensive care and during neurosurgery is challenging and requires adaptation to the respective clinical setting. The aim of the review is to present state of the art and progress in neurosurgery and neurointensive care where LDF has proven useful and can find clinical importance in the investigation of cerebral microcirculation. The literature in the field is summarized and recent technical improvements regarding LDF systems and fiber optical probe designs for neurosurgical and neurocritical care described. By combining two signals from the LDF unit, the measurement of the microcirculation (Perfusion) and gray whiteness (TLI) of the brain tissue, the full potential of the device is achieved. For example, a forward-looking LDF-probe detects high-risk hemorrhage areas and gray-white matter boundaries along intraoperative trajectories during stereotactic neurosurgery. Proof of principles are given for LDF as a guidance tool in deep brain stimulation implantation, brain tumor needle biopsies, and as long-term monitoring device in neurocritical care. With well-designed fiber optical probes, surgical fixation, and signal processing for movement reduction, LDF monitoring of the cerebral microcirculation is successful up to 10 days. The use of LDF can be combined with other physiological measurement techniques, for example, fluorescence spectroscopy for identification of glioblastoma during tumor surgery. Fiber optics can also be used during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite the many advantages, fiber optical LDF has not yet reached its full potential in clinical neuro-applications. Multicenter studies are required to further evaluate LDF in neurosurgery and neurointensive care. In conclusion, the present status of LDF in neurosurgery and neurointensive care has been reviewed. By combining Perfusion and TLI with tailored probe designs the full potential of LDF can be achived in measuring cerebral microcirculation. This includes guidance during DBS implantation and needle biopsies, and long-term monitoring in neurocritical care.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to measure cerebral, splanchnic, and renal transit times and the associated blood volumes using contrast ultrasound. In healthy individuals, regional transit times were calculated from time-intensity curves generated as ultrasound contrast passed through the associated inflow and outflow vessels. These included the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein (brain), the superior mesenteric artery and portal vein (intestines), and the renal artery and renal vein (kidney). An organ's blood volume relative to the stroke volume delivered to that organ with each cardiac cycle was calculated from the product of heart rate and transit time of contrast passage through the associated vascular bed. The fraction of systemic stroke volume received by each organ was calculated from the respective velocity-time integral and inflow vessel cross-sectional area and used to estimate absolute organ blood volume. The cohort consisted of 16 participants (age: 42 ± 13 years; 5 female) without known cerebrovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal disease. Cerebral, splanchnic, and renal transit times were obtained for 15, 14, and 8 individuals, respectively. Anatomic variability of the renal vessels confounded the acquisition of renal transit times. For all organs, transit times were reproducible and the associated blood volumes were generally comparable to reference values. Cerebral, gastrointestinal, and renal transit times/blood volumes can be reasonably acquired from contrast ultrasound, although the latter is less reliably available. Assessment of the impact on regional blood volumes of pharmacologic or other interventions is a next step toward clinical application of this technique.",

      "abstract": "The retinal microcirculation system constitutes a unique terminal vessel bed of the systemic circulation, and its perfusion status is directly associated with the neural function of the retina. This vascular network, essential for nourishing various layers of the retina, comprises two primary microcirculation systems: the retinal microcirculation and the choroidal microcirculation, with each system supplying blood to distinct retinal layers and maintaining the associated neural function. The blood flow of those capillaries is regulated via different mechanisms. However, a range of internal and external factors can disrupt the normal architecture and blood flow within the retinal microcirculation, leading to several retinal pathologies, including diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and vascular occlusions. Metabolic disturbances such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are known to modify retinal microcirculation through various pathways. These alterations are observable in chronic metabolic conditions like diabetes, coronary artery disease, and cerebral microvascular disease due to advances in non-invasive or minimally invasive retinal imaging techniques. Thus, examination of the retinal microcirculation can provide insights into the progression of numerous chronic metabolic disorders. This review discusses the anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology of the retinal microvascular system, with a particular emphasis on the connections between retinal microcirculation and systemic circulation in both healthy states and in the context of prevalent chronic metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "The coronary circulation is a complex system in which vascular resistances are determined by an interplay of forces in at least three compartments: the epicardial, the microvascular, and the venous district. Cardiologists, and particularly interventional cardiologists, normallly place the focus of their attention on diseases of the epicardial coronary circulation as possible causes of coronary syndromes and neglect the importance of the other two compartments of coronary circulation. The study of the coronary microcirculation, an increasingly recognized source of ischemia, has long been disregarded, but is witnessing a revival since the (re-)introduction of diagnostic tools in the better equipped catheterization laboratories. Unfortunately, to date our understanding of coronary microvascular disease remains incomplete and the numerous proposed classifications fail to reflect its complexity. Further, no specific therapy for these disorders is available. The coronary venous circulation is an even more neglected third vascular district. Its role in regulating coronary resistances is almost completely unexplored, but inital evidence suggests that the modulation of venous pressure might help improve coronary perfusion. Coronary sinus interventions are a group of invasive techniques (both surgical and catheter-based) that are designed to treat ischaemic heart disease by increasing coronary venous pressure and therefore redistributing coronary blood flow towards the endocardium. In this review paper, we revise the role of these interventions with particular focus on acute and chronic coronary microvascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic stroke presents a major global economic and public health burden. Although recent advances in available endovascular therapies show improved functional outcome, a good number of stroke patients are either ineligible or do not have access to these treatments. Also, robust collateral flow during acute ischemic stroke independently predicts the success of endovascular therapies and the outcome of stroke. Hence, adjunctive therapies for cerebral blood flow (CBF) enhancement are urgently needed. A very clear overview of the pial collaterals and the role of genetics are presented in this review. We review available evidence and advancement for potential therapies aimed at improving CBF during acute ischemic stroke. We identified heme-free soluble guanylate cyclase activators; Sanguinate, remote ischemic perconditioning; Fasudil, S1P agonists; and stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion as promising potential CBF-enhancing therapeutics requiring further investigation. Additionally, we outline and discuss the critical steps required to advance research strategies for clinically translatable CBF-enhancing agents in the context of acute ischemic stroke models.",

In particular, research on soy products has increased dramatically following their emergence as functional foods capable of improving blood circulation and intestinal regulation. In addition to their nutritional value, soybeans contain specific phytochemical substances that promote health and are a source of dietary fiber, phospholipids, isoflavones (e.g., genistein and daidzein), phenolic acids, saponins, and phytic acid, while serving as a trypsin inhibitor. These individual substances have demonstrated effectiveness in preventing chronic diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, cardiac diseases, diabetes, and senile dementia, as well as in treating cancer and suppressing osteoporosis. Furthermore, soybean can affect fibrinolytic activity, control blood pressure, and improve lipid metabolism, while eliciting antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, and antibacterial effects. In this review, rather than to improve on the established studies on the reported nutritional qualities of soybeans, we intend to examine the physiological activities of soybeans that have recently been studied and confirm their potential as a high-functional, well-being food.",

      "abstract": "Age-related cerebromicrovascular changes, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and microvascular rarefaction, play a significant role in the development of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and neurodegenerative diseases. Utilizing the unique model of heterochronic parabiosis, which involves surgically joining young and old animals, we investigated the influence of systemic factors on these vascular changes. Our study employed heterochronic parabiosis to explore the effects of young and aged systemic environments on cerebromicrovascular aging in mice. We evaluated microvascular density and BBB integrity in parabiotic pairs equipped with chronic cranial windows, using intravital two-photon imaging techniques. Our results indicate that short-term exposure to young systemic factors leads to both functional and structural rejuvenation of cerebral microcirculation. Notably, we observed a marked decrease in capillary density and an increase in BBB permeability to fluorescent tracers in the cortices of aged mice undergoing isochronic parabiosis (20-month-old C57BL/6 mice [A-(A)]; 6 weeks of parabiosis), compared to young isochronic parabionts (6-month-old, [Y-(Y)]). However, aged heterochronic parabionts (A-(Y)) exposed to young blood exhibited a significant increase in cortical capillary density and restoration of BBB integrity. In contrast, young mice exposed to old blood from aged parabionts (Y-(A)) rapidly developed cerebromicrovascular aging traits, evidenced by reduced capillary density and increased BBB permeability. These findings underscore the profound impact of systemic factors in regulating cerebromicrovascular aging. The rejuvenation observed in the endothelium, following exposure to young blood, suggests the existence of anti-geronic elements that counteract microvascular aging. Conversely, pro-geronic factors in aged blood appear to accelerate cerebromicrovascular aging. Further research is needed to assess whether the rejuvenating effects of young blood factors could extend to other age-related cerebromicrovascular pathologies, such as microvascular amyloid deposition and increased microvascular fragility.",

First, the plasma is separated from blood elements in extra-corporeal circulation by passing through membrane filter. The plasma is then filtrated through the second filter in order to remove proteins with a high molecular mass, e.g. lipids, fibrinogen, α2-macroglobulin, von Willebrand factor, immunoglobulin IgM. The purified plasma is then returned together with the blood elements back to the patient. The aim of the procedure is to improve the microcirculation and rheological properties of the blood. Rheopheresis is well established method for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration, acute sensorineural hearing loss, calciphylaxis, systemic sclerosis or peripheral vascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a major retinal disorder and a leading cause of blindness. Diabetic macular edema (DME) is an ocular complication in patients with diabetes, and it can impair vision significantly. DME is a disorder of the neurovascular system, and it causes obstructions of the retinal capillaries, damage of the blood vessels, and hyperpermeability due to the expression and action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These changes result in hemorrhages and leakages of the serous components of blood that result in failures of the neurovascular units (NVUs). Persistent edema of the retina around the macula causes damage to the neural cells that constitute the NVUs resulting in diabetic neuropathy of the retina and a reduction in vision quality. The macular edema and NVU disorders can be monitored by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Neuronal cell death and axonal degeneration are irreversible, and their development can result in permanent visual loss. Treating the edema before these changes are detected in the OCT images is necessary for neuroprotection and maintenance of good vision. This review describes the effective treatments for the macular edema that are therefore neuroprotective.",

      "abstract": "Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHPCCBs) are widely used to treat hypertension and chronic coronary artery disease. One common adverse effect of DHPCCBs is peripheral edema, particularly of the lower limbs. The side effect could lead to dose reduction or discontinuation of the medication. The combination of DHPCCBs and renin-angiotensin system blockers has shown to reduce the risk of DHPCCBs-associated peripheral edema compared with DHPCCBs monotherapy. We performed the current systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to estimate the rate of peripheral edema with DHPCCBs as a class and with individual DHPCCBs and the ranking of the reduction of peripheral edema. The effects of renin-angiotensin system blockers on DHPCCBs network meta-analysis were created to analyze the ranking of the reduction of peripheral edema. A total of 3312 publications were identified and 71 studies with 56,283 patients were included. Nifedipine ranked highest in inducing peripheral edema (SUCRA 81.8%) and lacidipine (SUCRA 12.8%) ranked the least. All DHPCCBs except lacidipine resulted in higher relative risk (RR) of peripheral edema compared with placebo. Nifedipine plus angiotensin receptor blocker (SUCRA: 92.3%) did not mitigate peripheral edema and amlodipine plus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (SUCRA: 16%) reduced peripheral edema the most. Nifedipine ranked the highest and lacidipine ranked the lowest amongst DHPCCBs for developing peripheral edema when used for cardiovascular indications. The second or higher generation of DHPCCBs combination with ACEIs or ARBs or diuretics lowered the chance of peripheral edema development compared to single DHPCCB treatment.",

Acute prolapse of internal haemorrhoids is presented with oedema, inflammation and acute pain.

After the topical application of sugar, haemorrhoids begin to shrink immediately and edema is drastically reduced, while haemorrhoidal tissue can easily retracted back into the anal canal. The method is a cheap, quick and painless way to control the worsening symptoms such as swelling, bleeding and irritation. In addition, this method can easily be applied in the GP practice without the necessity of any form of anaesthesia.",

      "title": "Compression therapy for leg oedema in patients with heart failure.",
      "abstract": "The presence of chronic heart failure (CHF) results in a significant risk of leg oedema. Medical compression (MC) treatment is one of the basic methods of leg oedema elimination in patients with chronic venous disease and lymphedema, but it is not routinely considered in subjects with CHF-related swelling. In the study, an overview of the current knowledge related to the benefits and risk of using MC in the supportive treatment of leg oedema in CHF patients is presented. The available studies dedicated the comprehensive management of leg swelling using MC in CHF patients published in the English language literature till December 2019 were evaluated in term of the treatment efficacy and safety. In studies performed on CHF populations, manual lymphatic drainage, MC stocking, multilayer bandaged, as well as intermittent pneumatic compression or electric calf stimulations were used. The current evidence is based on non-randomized studies, small study cohorts, as well as very heterogenous populations. The use of the intermittent pneumatic compression in CHF patients significantly increases the right auricular pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressures as well as decreases systemic vascular resistance in most patients without the clinical worsening. The transient and rapid increase in the human atrial natriuretic peptide, after an application of the MC stocking in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II patients was observed without clinical exacerbation. An application of the multilayer bandages in NYHA classes III and IV patients lead a significant increase in the right arterial pressure and lead to transient deterioration of the right and the left ventricular functions. In the manual lymphatic drainage study, aside from expected leg circumference reduction, no clinical worsening was observed. In a pilot study performed in a small cohort of CHF patients, electrical calf stimulation use resulted in a reduction in the lean mass of the legs without cardiac function worsening. The use of local leg compression can be considered stable CHF patients without decompensated heart function for both CHF-related oedema treatment and for treatment of the concomitant diseases leading to leg swelling occurrence. The use of MC in more severe classes of CHF (NYHA III and IV) should be the subject of future clinical studies to select the safest and most efficient compression method as well as to select the patients who benefit most from this kind of treatment.",

This case will discuss the use of intravenous diphenhydramine (Benadryl), the application of ice to the cervix, side-lying release, epidural analgesia use, manual reduction of the cervix, and various positions to encourage reduction in cervical swelling. It is hoped these strategies will add to a midwife's clinical resources by providing ways to promote vaginal birth in the setting of cervical edema during labor.",

      "abstract": "The TRAILBLAZER-ALZ 6 study (NCT05738486) evaluated the effect of different donanemab dosing regimens on amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema/sulcal effusions (ARIA-E). The modified titration arm met the primary outcome and significantly reduced ARIA-E frequency compared with the standard dosing while maintaining a similar pharmacodynamic effect on amyloid reduction at 24 weeks. Primary outcome and 52-week data were previously published. Completed study results at 76 weeks are reported here. ARIA-E frequencies were 15.6 % and 24.2 % in the modified titration and standard arms, respectively. ARIA-E radiographic severity was significantly lower (p = 0.015) with modified titration than with standard dosing. Additionally, symptomatic ARIA-E frequency was lower with modified titration versus standard dosing (2.8 % vs 4.8 %). The frequency of serious adverse events was comparable between the modified titration and standard dosing arms. A more gradual titration of donanemab dosing significantly reduced ARIA-E risk versus standard dosing. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT05738486.",

      "abstract": "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) has been used to reduce pain or improve motor function in musculoskeletal and neurological disorders in the clinic. Although some studies have suggested electrotherapy as an intervention for edema, the effects and mechanisms of TENS on inflammation-induced edema remain unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of TENS on arthritic pain with edema. 1% carrageenan was injected into the right tibiofemoral joint of 69 male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g). After the development of arthritic pain, low-frequency (4-Hz, Low-TENS, n = 25) and high-frequency (100-Hz, High-TENS, n = 25) TENS with sub-motor threshold or placebo-TENS (n = 19) was applied for 20-min to medio-lateral part of the ipsilateral side. Weight bearing and knee-bend tests were used to assess pain-like behaviors. Also, we examined the size of edema and measured tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels in the synovium by western blot. Eight rats in each of the two TENS groups were injected with Naloxone. Edema was reduced in the low- and high-frequency TENS groups at 6-h. TENS-treated rats showed reduced pain in the knee-bend test at 6-h. We observed decreased weight load shifts on the ipsilateral side in TENS groups. Naloxone reduced these effects. TNF-α and IL-1β expression decreased in the synovial membrane at 6-h. These results suggest that low- and high-frequency TENS have acutely positive effects on inflammatory edema, with the management of arthritic pain and reduction in pro-inflammatory mediators. Therefore, Low-TENS and High-TENS may be useful in treating acute inflammatory pain and edema.",

      "abstract": "Renal artery stenosis manifests as poorly-controlled hypertension, impaired renal function or pulmonary oedema, therefore the success of treatment is dependent on indication. This study aims to determine the outcomes of patients undergoing renal artery stenting (RASt) based on therapeutic aim compared to criteria used in the largest randomised trial. Retrospective case-note review of patients undergoing RASt between 2008-2021 (n = 74). The cohort was stratified by indication for intervention (renal dysfunction, hypertension, pulmonary oedema) and criteria employed in the CORAL trial, with outcomes and adverse consequences reported. Intervention for hypertension achieved significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and antihypertensive agents at 1 year (median 43 mmHg, 1 drug), without detrimental impact on renal function. Intervention for renal dysfunction reduced serum creatinine by a median 124 μmol/L, sustained after 6 months. Intervention for pulmonary oedema was universally successful with significant reduction in SBP and serum creatinine sustained at 1 year. Patients who would have been excluded from the CORAL trial achieved greater reduction in serum creatinine than patients meeting the inclusion criteria, with equivalent blood pressure reduction. There were 2 procedure-related mortalities and 5 procedural complications requiring further intervention. 5 patients had reduction in renal function following intervention and 7 failed to achieve the intended therapeutic benefit. Renal artery stenting is effective in treating the indication for which it has been performed. Previous trials may have underestimated the clinical benefits by analysis of a heterogenous population undergoing a procedure rather than considering the indication, and excluding patients who would maximally benefit.",

      "abstract": "Objective To systematically review the literature and assess the effectiveness of perioperative systemic and nonsystemic therapies in reducing edema after orthognathic surgery. Study Design Four databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Bireme, and Scopus) were searched. Only randomized clinical trials were included and assessed using the RoB 2.0 software (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Studies were grouped into time of assessment and systemic/nonsystemic therapy. Results Eighteen studies were included in this review (8 in the meta-analysis, n = 349). The qualitative assessment of systemic (enzyme therapy, dexamethasone, betamethasone, and Venoplant) and nonsystemic therapies (thermotherapy and K-Taping) appear to reduce edema. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) after 72 hours (CI: -1.03 to 2.31; P = .45), and 30 days (CI: -1.53 to 0.49; P = .49), and laser after 24 hours (CI: -1.36 to 1.48; P = .93), 72 hours (CI: -4.81 to 2.92; P = .63), 30 days (CI: -3.44 to 0.99; P = .28), and 90 days (CI: -1.83 to 0.96; P = .54) showed no significance. Thermotherapy reduced edema after 48 hours (CI: -48.47 to -13.31; P = .0006) and 30 days (CI: -14.73 to -1.98; P = .01). Conclusion The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations tool showed moderate evidence for thermotherapy (significant reduction of edema), whereas the MLD and laser results were rated as high certainty of evidence (no reduction of edema).",

      "title": "Diuretic resistance in patients with kidney disease: Challenges and opportunities.",
      "abstract": "Edema caused by kidney disease is called renal edema. Edema is a common symptom of many human kidney diseases. Patients with renal edema often need to take diuretics.However, After taking diuretics, patients with kidney diseases are prone to kidney congestion, decreased renal perfusion, decreased diuretics secreted by renal tubules, neuroendocrine system abnormalities, abnormal ion transporter transport, drug interaction, electrolyte disorder, and hypoproteinemia, which lead to ineffective or weakened diuretic use and increase readmission rate and mortality. The main causes and coping strategies of diuretic resistance in patients with kidney diseases were described in detail in this report. The common causes of DR included poor diet (electrolyte disturbance and hypoproteinemia due to patients' failure to limit diet according to correct sodium, chlorine, potassium, and protein level) and poor drug compliance (the patient did not take adequate doses of diuretics. true resistance occurs only if the patient takes adequate doses of diuretics, but they are not effective), changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, electrolyte disorders, changes in renal adaptation, functional nephron reduction, and decreased renal blood flow. Common treatment measures include increasing in the diuretic dose and/or frequency, sequential nephron blockade,using new diuretics, ultrafiltration treatment, etc. In clinical work, measures should be taken to prevent or delay the occurrence and development of DR in patients with kidney diseases according to the actual situation of patients and the mechanism of various causes. Currently, there are many studies on DR in patients with heart diseases. Although the phenomenon of DR in patients with kidney diseases is common, there is a relatively little overview of the mechanism and treatment strategy of DR in patients with kidney diseases. Therefore, this paper hopes to show the information on DR in patients with kidney diseases to clinicians and researchers and broaden the research direction and ideas to a certain extent.",

Since the main complications after rhinoseptoplasty are caused by excessive inflammatory reactions and development of fibrosis along nasal implants which can lead to a revision rhinoseptoplasty, in this retrospective multicenter blinded study we have evaluated the efficacy of LDM ultrasound for the treatment of the postoperative perilesional ecchymosis and edema in patients after rhinoseptoplasty.",

Thus, this study was conducted to compare ICU patients' upper limb edema between two groups with the intervention of limb elevation and intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC). In this quasi-experimental before and after study, 40 patients were recruited. One upper limb was randomly assigned to the upper limb elevation (ULE) group and the other one was assigned to the IPC group. The circumference of the wrist and the middle of the arm were compared between and within groups. Results showed that in both groups of IPC and ULE and all five sessions (unless the second session of ULE), participants' arm and wrist edema were reduced significantly after the interventions (arm: P < .01; wrist: P < .0001). The differences between the two groups of ULE and IPC in regards to limb edema reduction were not significant. Although there was no significant difference between IPC and ULE intervention in the removal of edema, ULE seems to be more feasible and practical, which should be assessed in future studies.",

      "abstract": "Normal shear stress is essential for the normal structure and functions of the microcirculation. Hemorrhagic shock leads to reduced shear stress due to reduced tissue perfusion. Although essential for the urgent restoration of cardiac output and systemic blood pressure, large volume resuscitation with currently available solutions causes hemodilution, further reducing endothelial shear stress. In this narrative review, we consider how the use of currently available resuscitation solutions results in persistent reduction in endothelial shear stress, despite successfully increasing cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. We consider how this reduced shear stress causes (1) a failure to restore normal vasomotor function and normal tissue perfusion thus leading to persistent tissue hypoxia and (2) increased microvascular endothelial permeability resulting in edema formation and impaired organ function. We discuss the need for clinical research into resuscitation strategies and solutions that aim to quickly restore endothelial shear stress in the microcirculation to normal.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal traumas are among the most common routine challenges faced by Emergency Radiologists, in particular in case of radiographically occult nondisplaced fractures or in case of soft tissue injuries. With the development of Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) technology, new post-processing applications have gained a useful diagnostic role in many fields of musculoskeletal imaging including acute skeletal trauma imaging. In addition to conventional CT images, DECT allows for the generation of virtual calcium-suppressed images subtracting calcium from unenhanced CT images based on the fact that material attenuation varies at different energy levels. In this way, virtual-non-calcium (VNC) images can precisely characterize traumatic bone marrow edema in both axial and appendicular skeleton, facilitating prompt clinical decision, especially when magnetic resonance method is contraindicated or unavailable. Other DECT emerging applications in the trauma setting include metal artifact reduction and collagen mapping for the evaluation of injuries affecting ligament, tendon, and intervertebral disk. This review focuses on the basic principles of DECT and related post-processing algorithms, highlighting the current advantages and limitations of these new imaging advances in the Emergency Department related to skeletal traumas.",

      "title": "Effect of Tranexamic Acid on Progression of Hematoma in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh and also worldwide. Secondary brain injury from progressive intracerebral hematoma, increasing cerebral edema, raised intracranial pressure and subsequent cerebral ischemia is the main cause for morbidity and mortality following TBI. Secondary brain injury is worsened by post-traumatic coagulopathy, which occurs in brain injured patients and is associated with increase in risk of death and morbidity. The antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces the hematoma expansion and demonstrated improved clinical outcome also reduced the mortality and morbidity. This was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) done in the Department of Neurosurgery, Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Included patients were randomized to get either the intravenous tranexamic acid (Group A) or placebo (Group B) treatment based on a computer-generated code list (50 patients in each group) along with usual medical management for traumatic brain injury. The extent of contusion expansion (hematoma plus perihematomal oedema) as the primary outcome at 48 hour after admission and was measured by brain CT scan. The contusion and oedema volume were calculated both the times (on admission and after 48 hours). Glasgow coma scale (GCS) after 48 hours and Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) after 7 days were observed. In this study showed increase in hematoma volume in both groups (p<0.05). But the increased hematoma volume in the Group A was significantly less than that in the control group. The mean total hemorrhage expansion was (1.5±1.1) ml and (4.6±1.9) ml in the Group A and Group B, respectively. In Group A- 02(4.0%) patients required operation, whereas in Group B- 11(22.0%) patients required operation. The result was significant (p=0.023) between groups. Therefore use of tranexamic acid is associated with lesser hematoma volume progression. Mean GCS (after 48 hours), mean GOS (after 7 days) result were significantly better in Group A (p<0.001). This study concluded that tranexamic acid has beneficial effect on the patient with significant traumatic brain injury. Tranexamic acid helps in reduction of intracerebral progression of contusion and improvement of clinical outcomes in patients with TBI.",

      "abstract": "This Systematic Review and Meta-analysis was conducted with the following PICOS question: patients undergoing third molar surgery (P) can benefit from low-intensity laser therapy (I) as compared to other postoperative management (C) to reduce pain, edema, and trismus (O), evaluated in previous randomized clinical trials (S). Databases used were PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde, screening for studies published between 2015 and 2020. The meta-analysis was based on the standardized mean difference (SMD), under a 95% confidence interval (CI). 246 studies were initially included, and after the screening of data, 10 studies were selected for the final sample. The qualitative analysis resulted in favorable results for pain and edema management in most studies, whereas trismus remained controversial. Meta-analysis resulted in (SMD, -0.53; 95% CI, -0.82,-0.24), (SMD, -0.60; 95% CI, -0.81,-0.39), and (SMD, -0.62; 95% CI, -2.63, 1.39) for pain, edema, and trismus, respectively, indicating statistical success on pain and edema reduction, but not for trismus. LLLT can act on reducing postoperative pain and edema following third molar surgery, whereas, trismus remains not significantly changed.",

      "title": "A Comparison Between Piezosurgery and Conventional Osteotomies in Rhinoplasty on Post-Operative Oedema and Ecchymosis: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Piezosurgery use has become increasingly prevalent in osteotomies. Piezoelectric ultrasound waves can cut bone effectively, and some studies have shown reduced post-operative morbidities compared to conventional osteotomies. Oedema and ecchymosis are common complications of rhinoplasty and can impact patient satisfaction, wound healing, and recovery. We aim to provide an up-to-date comparison of post-operative oedema and ecchymosis in piezosurgery and conventional osteotomies. A literature search was conducted using the following online libraries; Pubmed, Cochrane, Science Direct, and ISRCTN (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number). English publications between 2015 and 2020 were included. A systematic review was completed, and a comparison of oedema and ecchymosis in piezosurgery and conventional osteotomies was examined alongside other outcomes such as pain, mucosal injury, and surgery time. Eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met our criteria with a combined total of 440 patients: 191 male and 249 female. Piezosurgery had statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in short-term oedema compared to conventional osteotomies in 75% of the papers included, and in 50% this persisted across the whole follow-up period. Similarly, ecchymosis scoring was initially statistically lower (p < 0.05) in piezosurgery in 87.5% of the RCTs, and in 75% this persisted across the whole follow-up period. A reduction in pain (p < 0.05) and mucosal injury (p < 0.05) was also seen in piezoelectric osteotomies. The length of surgery time varied. Piezoelectric osteotomies reduce oedema and ecchymosis compared to conventional osteotomies, in addition to improving pain and mucosal injury. However, disadvantages such as length of surgery time and cost have been reported. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE III: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

      "title": "Testosterone acts through the membrane protein GPRC6A to cause cardiac edema in zebrafish embryos.",
      "abstract": "Androgens are classically thought to act through intracellular androgen receptors (AR/NR3C4), but they can also trigger non-genomic effects via membrane proteins. Although several membrane androgen receptors have been characterized in vitro, their functions in vivo remain unclear. Using a chemical-genetic screen in zebrafish, we found that GPRC6A, a G-protein-coupled receptor, mediates non-genomic androgen actions during embryonic development. Exposure to androgens (androstanedione, DHT and testosterone) caused cardiac edema or tail curvature in wild-type embryos, as well as in ar mutants, suggesting AR-independent pathways. We then mutated putative membrane androgen receptors [gprc6a, hcar1-4 and zip9 (slc39a9)] and found that only gprc6a mutants exhibited a significant reduction in cardiac edema after testosterone exposure. Additionally, co-treatment of wild-type embryos with testosterone and GPRC6A antagonists significantly suppressed the cardiac edema phenotype. Using RNA-seq and RNA rescue approaches, we found that testosterone and GPRC6A cause cardiac phenotypes by reducing Pak1 signaling. Our results indicate that testosterone induces cardiac edema in zebrafish embryos through GPRC6A, independent of nuclear androgen receptors, highlighting a previously unappreciated non-genomic androgen signaling pathway in embryonic development.",

      "abstract": "Edema as an adverse drug reaction is a commonly underestimated yet potentially debilitating condition. This study analyzes the incidence of severe psychotropic drug-induced edema (e.g., edema affecting the face, legs, or multiple body parts and lasting for more than 1 week, or in any case necessitating subsequent diuretic use) among psychiatric inpatients. The cases under examination are derived from an observational pharmacovigilance program conducted in German-speaking countries (\"Arzneimittelsicherheit in der Psychiatrie\", AMSP) from 1993 to 2016. Among the 462,661 inpatients monitored, severe edema was reported in 231 cases, resulting in an incidence of 0.05%. Edema occurred more frequently in women (80% of all cases) and older patients (mean age 51.8 years). Pregabalin had the highest incidence of severe edema, affecting 1.46‰ of patients treated with pregabalin, followed by mirtazapine (0.8‰). The majority of edema cases showed a positive response to appropriate countermeasures, such as dose reduction and drug discontinuation, and resolved by the end of the observation period. While most instances of drug-induced edema are reversible, they can have a significant impact on patient well-being and potentially result in decreased treatment adherence. It is, therefore, crucial to remain vigilant regarding risk-increasing circumstances during treatment with psychotropic drugs.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation-related diseases are recognized as the major cause of morbidity around the globe. In this study, the anti-inflammatory potential of sericin, curcumin, and their mixture was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Edema was induced via 1% carrageenan and then sericin (0.03, 0.06, 0.09 mg/ml), curcumin (1%, 2%, 3%), and their mixture doses were applied topically. The paw circumference and thickness were measured after 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-hour post-carrageenan injection. The levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were measured from the serum. In mice fibroblast cells, sericin (20, 40, 60 μg/ml), curcumin (5, 10, 20 μM), and mixture concentrations were applied and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Afterward, the cells were used for the analysis of gene expression, and the supernatant was collected for protein expression of IL-1β, IL-4, and IL-10. Our results demonstrated that sericin and curcumin caused a dose-dependent reduction in edema, whereas the mixture-treated group reduced the paw thickness and circumference most significantly (p = .0001). Furthermore, the mixture treatment of carrageenan-inflicted group increased the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 (650.87 pg/ml) and IL-10 (183.14 pg/ml), in comparison to the carrageenan control. The in vitro data revealed that among all the treatment doses, the mixture-treated group has effectively reduced the gene (1.13-fold) and protein (51.9 pg/ml) expression of IL-1β in comparison to McCoy cells stimulated with LPS. Moreover, mixture treatment elevated the expression of IL-4 and IL-10 at genes (4.3-fold and 3.7-fold, respectively) and protein levels (169.33 and 141.83 pg/ml, respectively). The current study reports the enhanced anti-inflammatory effects of the mixture of curcumin and sericin through modulating expressions of interleukins in vitro and in vivo. Thus, natural products (curcumin and sericin)-based formulations have greater potential for clinical investigations.",

      "abstract": "Large territory middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischaemic strokes account for around 10% of all ischaemic strokes and have a particularly devastating prognosis when associated with malignant oedema. Progressive cerebral oedema starts developing in the first 24 to 48 hours of stroke ictus with an associated rise in intracranial pressure. The rise in intracranial pressure may eventually overwhelm compensatory mechanisms leading to a cascading secondary damage to surrounding unaffected parenchyma. This downward spiral can rapidly progress to death or severe neurological disability. Early decompressive craniectomy to relieve intracranial pressure and associated tissue shift can help ameliorate this secondary damage and improve outcomes. Evidence has been accumulating of the benefit of early surgical decompression in stroke patients. Earlier studies have excluded people above the age of 60 due to associated poor outcomes; however, newer trials have included this patient subgroup. This review follows a Cochrane Review published in 2012.",

This type of oedema is initiated when blood flow in the affected core region falls sufficiently to deprive brain cells of the ATP needed to maintain ion gradients.

Etiologies are broadly divided into traumatic, including postsurgical, and nontraumatic, most commonly in the setting of malignancy. The management of chylothorax largely depends on the cause and includes dietary modification and drainage of the pleural space. A definitive intervention, whether surgical or a percutaneous lymphatic intervention, should be considered in patients with a persistently high volume of chylous output and in those with a prolonged leak, before complications such as malnutrition ensue. No methodologically robust clinical trials guiding management are currently available. In this article, we review the current literature and propose a stepwise, evidence-based multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothorax.",

      "abstract": "Lymphoedema is the swelling of one or several parts of the body owing to lymph accumulation in the extracellular space. It is often chronic, worsens if untreated, predisposes to infections and causes an important reduction in quality of life. Primary lymphoedema (PLE) is thought to result from abnormal development and/or functioning of the lymphatic system, can present in isolation or as part of a syndrome, and can be present at birth or develop later in life. Mutations in numerous genes involved in the initial formation of lymphatic vessels (including valves) as well as in the growth and expansion of the lymphatic system and associated pathways have been identified in syndromic and non-syndromic forms of PLE. Thus, the current hypothesis is that most cases of PLE have a genetic origin, although a causative mutation is identified in only about one-third of affected individuals. Diagnosis relies on clinical presentation, imaging of the structure and functionality of the lymphatics, and in genetic analyses. Management aims at reducing or preventing swelling by compression therapy (with manual drainage, exercise and compressive garments) and, in carefully selected cases, by various surgical techniques. Individuals with PLE often have a reduced quality of life owing to the psychosocial and lifelong management burden associated with their chronic condition. Improved understanding of the underlying genetic origins of PLE will translate into more accurate diagnosis and prognosis and personalized treatment.",

The classification of cervical lymph nodes by Rouvière has long been most widely referenced in textbooks and articles because it covers most of the lymph nodes of the head and neck region. Anatomical review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck helps surgeons understand and treat the patients who have any cancers and cancer metastasis in and around the head and neck regions. Regardless, comprehensive review of the lymphatic system of the head and neck has been rarely discussed. This paper details the anatomy of the lymphatics of these regions by reviewing related publications, books, official reports from the academic society and also describes the clinical manifestations and levels used in staging of the various lymph nodes with illustrations and computed tomographic images.",

      "abstract": "There are two vascular networks in mammals that coordinately function as the main supply and drainage systems of the body. The blood vasculature carries oxygen, nutrients, circulating cells, and soluble factors to and from every tissue. The lymphatic vasculature maintains interstitial fluid homeostasis, transports hematopoietic cells for immune surveillance, and absorbs fat from the gastrointestinal tract. These vascular systems consist of highly organized networks of specialized vessels including arteries, veins, capillaries, and lymphatic vessels that exhibit different structures and cellular composition enabling distinct functions. All vessels are composed of an inner layer of endothelial cells that are in direct contact with the circulating fluid; therefore, they are the first responders to circulating factors. However, endothelial cells are not homogenous; rather, they are a heterogenous population of specialized cells perfectly designed for the physiological demands of the vessel they constitute. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the specification of arterial, venous, capillary, and lymphatic endothelial cell identities during vascular development. We also discuss how the dysregulation of these processes can lead to vascular malformations, and therapeutic approaches that have been developed for their treatment.",

Whether MLVs exist in the anterior part of the murine and human skull and how they connect with the glymphatic system and extracranial lymphatics remained unclear. Here, we used light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging of mouse whole-head preparations after OVA-A555 tracer injection into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and performed real-time vessel-wall (VW) magnetic resonance imaging (VW-MRI) after systemic injection of gadobutrol in patients with neurological pathologies. We observed a conserved three-dimensional anatomy of MLVs in mice and humans that aligned with dural venous sinuses but not with nasal CSF outflow, and we discovered an extended anterior MLV network around the cavernous sinus, with exit routes through the foramina of emissary veins. VW-MRI may provide a diagnostic tool for patients with CSF drainage defects and neurological diseases.",

Dysfunction of mLVs results in the deposition of metabolic products, accelerates neuroinflammation, and promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. Thus, mLVs represent a novel therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize the structure and function of mLVs and to discuss the potential effect of aging and ApoE4 on mLV dysfunction, as well as their roles in the pathogenesis of AD.",

      "abstract": "The recent discovery of the meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) and glymphatic pathways has challenged the long-lasting dogma that the central nervous system (CNS) lacks a lymphatic system and therefore does not interact with peripheral immunity. This discovery has reshaped our understanding of mechanisms underlying CNS drainage. Under normal conditions, a close connection between mLVs and the glymphatic system enables metabolic waste removal, immune cell trafficking, and CNS immune surveillance. Dysfunction of the glymphatic-mLV system can lead to toxic protein accumulation in the brain, and it contributes to the development of a series of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The identification of precise cerebral transport routes is based mainly on indirect, invasive imaging of animals, and the results cannot always be applied to humans. Here we review the functions of the glymphatic-mLV system and evidence for its involvement in some CNS diseases. We focus on emerging noninvasive imaging techniques to evaluate the human glymphatic-mLV system and their potential for preclinical diagnosis and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. Potential strategies that target the glymphatic-mLV system in order to treat and prevent neurological disorders are also discussed.",

      "title": "Meningeal lymphatic drainage: novel insights into central nervous system disease.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that meningeal lymphatic drainage plays a significant role in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Studies have indicated that CNS diseases and conditions associated with meningeal lymphatic drainage dysfunction include neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, infections, traumatic brain injury, tumors, functional cranial disorders, and hydrocephalus. However, the understanding of the regulatory and damage mechanisms of meningeal lymphatics under physiological and pathological conditions is currently limited. Given the importance of a profound understanding of the interplay between meningeal lymphatic drainage and CNS diseases, this review covers seven key aspects: the development and structure of meningeal lymphatic vessels, methods for observing meningeal lymphatics, the function of meningeal lymphatics, the molecular mechanisms of meningeal lymphatic injury, the relationships between meningeal lymphatic vessels and CNS diseases, potential regulatory mechanisms of meningeal lymphatics, and conclusions and outstanding questions. We will explore the relationship between the development, structure, and function of meningeal lymphatics, review current methods for observing meningeal lymphatic vessels in both animal models and humans, and identify unresolved key points in meningeal lymphatic research. The aim of this review is to provide new directions for future research and therapeutic strategies targeting meningeal lymphatics by critically analyzing recent advancements in the field, identifying gaps in current knowledge, and proposing innovative approaches to address these gaps.",

Distributed throughout the body and embedded in the lymphatic system, local lymph nodes are continuously informed about the state of the organs owing to a constant drainage of lymph. The tissue-derived lymph carries products of cell metabolism, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, pathogens and circulating immune cells. Notably, there is a growing body of evidence that individual lymph nodes differ from each other in their capacity to generate immune responses. Here, we review the structure and function of the lymphatic system and then focus on the factors that lead to functional heterogeneity among different lymph nodes.

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-related form of dementia associated with the accumulation of pathological aggregates of amyloid beta and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These phenomena are accompanied by exacerbated inflammation and marked neuronal loss, which altogether contribute to accelerated cognitive decline. The multifactorial nature of AD, allied to our still limited knowledge of its etiology and pathophysiology, have lessened our capacity to develop effective treatments for AD patients. Over the last few decades, genome wide association studies and biomarker development, alongside mechanistic experiments involving animal models, have identified different immune components that play key roles in the modulation of brain pathology in AD, affecting its progression and severity. As we will relay in this review, much of the recent efforts have been directed to better understanding the role of brain innate immunity, and particularly of microglia. However, and despite the lack of diversity within brain resident immune cells, the brain border tissues, especially the meninges, harbour a considerable number of different types and subtypes of adaptive and innate immune cells. Alongside microglia, which have taken the centre stage as important players in AD research, there is new and exciting evidence pointing to adaptive immune cells, namely T and B cells found in the brain and its meninges, as important modulators of neuroinflammation and neuronal (dys)function in AD. Importantly, a genuine and functional lymphatic vascular network is present around the brain in the outermost meningeal layer, the dura. The meningeal lymphatics are directly connected to the peripheral lymphatic system in different mammalian species, including humans, and play a crucial role in preserving a \"healthy\" immune surveillance of the CNS, by shaping immune responses, not only locally at the meninges, but also at the level of the brain tissue. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive view on our current knowledge about the meningeal lymphatic vasculature, emphasizing its described roles in modulating CNS fluid and macromolecule drainage, meningeal and brain immunity, as well as glial and neuronal function in aging and in AD.",

      "abstract": "Skull development coincides with the onset of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, brain-CSF perfusion, and meningeal lymphangiogenesis, processes essential for brain waste clearance. How these processes are affected by craniofacial disorders such as craniosynostosis are poorly understood. We report that raised intracranial pressure and diminished CSF flow in craniosynostosis mouse models associate with pathological changes to meningeal lymphatic vessels that affect their sprouting, expansion, and long-term maintenance. We also show that craniosynostosis affects CSF circulatory pathways and perfusion into the brain. Further, craniosynostosis exacerbates amyloid pathology and plaque buildup in Twist1+/-:5xFAD transgenic Alzheimer's disease models. Treating craniosynostosis mice with Yoda1, a small molecule agonist for Piezo1, reduces intracranial pressure and improves CSF flow, in addition to restoring meningeal lymphangiogenesis, drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes, and brain-CSF perfusion. Leveraging these findings, we show that Yoda1 treatments in aged mice with reduced CSF flow and turnover improve lymphatic networks, drainage, and brain-CSF perfusion. Our results suggest that CSF provides mechanical force to facilitate meningeal lymphatic growth and maintenance. Additionally, applying Yoda1 agonist in conditions with raised intracranial pressure and/or diminished CSF flow, as seen in craniosynostosis or with ageing, is a possible therapeutic option to help restore meningeal lymphatic networks and brain-CSF perfusion.",

      "abstract": "The meningeal lymphatic network enables the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and facilitates the removal of central nervous system (CNS) waste. During aging and in Alzheimer's disease, impaired meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes the buildup of toxic misfolded proteins in the CNS. Reversing this age-related dysfunction represents a promising strategy to augment CNS waste clearance; however, the mechanisms underlying this decline remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that age-related alterations in meningeal immunity underlie this lymphatic impairment. Single-cell RNA sequencing of meningeal lymphatic endothelial cells from aged mice revealed their response to IFNγ, which was increased in the aged meninges due to T cell accumulation. Chronic elevation of meningeal IFNγ in young mice via AAV-mediated overexpression attenuated CSF drainage-comparable to the deficits observed in aged mice. Therapeutically, IFNγ neutralization alleviated age-related impairments in meningeal lymphatic function. These data suggest manipulation of meningeal immunity as a viable approach to normalize CSF drainage and alleviate the neurological deficits associated with impaired waste removal.",

Here, we find that Piezo1 is necessary for the proper development and function of meningeal lymphatic vessels and that activating Piezo1 through transgenic overexpression or treatment with the chemical agonist Yoda1 is sufficient to increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow by improving lymphatic absorption and transport. The abnormal accumulation of CSF, which often leads to hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly, currently lacks effective treatments. We discovered that meningeal lymphatics in mouse models of Down syndrome were incompletely developed and abnormally formed. Selective overexpression of Piezo1 in lymphatics or systemic administration of Yoda1 in mice with hydrocephalus or Down syndrome resulted in a notable decrease in pathological CSF accumulation, ventricular enlargement and other associated disease symptoms. Together, our study highlights the importance of Piezo1-mediated lymphatic mechanotransduction in maintaining brain fluid drainage and identifies Piezo1 as a promising therapeutic target for treating excessive CSF accumulation and ventricular enlargement.",

      "abstract": "The lymphatic vasculature is the natural pathway for the resolution of inflammation, yet the role of pulmonary lymphatic drainage function in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains poorly characterized. In this study, indocyanine green-near infrared lymphatic living imaging was performed to examine pulmonary lymphatic drainage function in septic mouse models. We found that the pulmonary lymphatic drainage was impaired owing to the damaged lymphatic structure in sepsis-induced ARDS. Moreover, prior lymphatic defects by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) worsened sepsis-induced lymphatic dysfunction and inflammation. Posttreatment with vascular endothelial growth factor-C (Cys156Ser) (VEGF-C156S), a ligand of VEGFR-3, ameliorated lymphatic drainage by rejuvenating lymphatics to reduce the pulmonary edema and promote draining of pulmonary macrophages and neutrophils to pretracheal lymph nodes. Meanwhile, VEGF-C156S posttreatment reversed sepsis-inhibited CC chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), which colocalizes with pulmonary lymphatic vessels. Furthermore, the advantages of VEGF-C156S on the drainage of inflammatory cells and edema fluid were abolished by blocking VEGFR-3 or CCL21. These results suggest that efficient pulmonary lymphatic drainage is necessary for inflammation resolution in ARDS. Our findings offer a therapeutic approach to sepsis-induced ARDS by promoting lymphatic drainage function.",

      "abstract": "The glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatics have recently been characterized. Glymphatic system is a glia-dependent system of perivascular channels, and it plays an important role in the removal of interstitial metabolic waste products. The meningeal lymphatics may be a key drainage route for cerebrospinal fluid into the peripheral blood, may contribute to inflammatory reaction and central nervous system (CNS) immune surveillance. Breakdowns and dysfunction of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatics play a crucial role in age-related brain changes, the pathogenesis of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as in brain injuries and tumors. This review discusses the relationship recently characterized meningeal lymphatic vessels with the glymphatic system, which provides perfusion of the CNS with cerebrospinal and interstitial fluids. The review also presents the results of human studies concerning both the presence of meningeal lymphatics and the glymphatic system. A new understanding of how aging, medications, sleep and wake cycles, genetic predisposition, and even body posture affect the brain drainage system has not only changed the idea of brain fluid circulation but has also contributed to an understanding of the pathology and mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) promote tissue clearance and immune surveillance in the central nervous system (CNS). Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) regulates MLV development and maintenance and has therapeutic potential for treating neurological disorders. Herein, we investigated the effects of VEGF-C overexpression on brain fluid drainage and ischemic stroke outcomes in mice. Intracerebrospinal administration of an adeno-associated virus expressing mouse full-length VEGF-C (AAV-mVEGF-C) increased CSF drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs) by enhancing lymphatic growth and upregulated neuroprotective signaling pathways identified by single nuclei RNA sequencing of brain cells. In a mouse model of ischemic stroke, AAV-mVEGF-C pretreatment reduced stroke injury and ameliorated motor performances in the subacute stage, associated with mitigated microglia-mediated inflammation and increased BDNF signaling in brain cells. Neuroprotective effects of VEGF-C were lost upon cauterization of the dCLN afferent lymphatics and not mimicked by acute post-stroke VEGF-C injection. We conclude that VEGF-C prophylaxis promotes multiple vascular, immune, and neural responses that culminate in a protection against neurological damage in acute ischemic stroke.",

      "abstract": "White matter hyperintensity (WMH) represents a critical global medical concern linked to cognitive decline and dementia, yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, humans are directly demonstrated that high WMH burden correlates with delayed drainage of meningeal lymphatic vessels (mLVs) and glymphatic pathway. Additionally, a longitudinal cohort study reveals that glymphatic dysfunction predicts WMH progression. Next, in a rat model of WMH, the presence of impaired lymphangiogenesis and glymphatic drainage is confirmed, followed by elevated microglial activation and white matter demyelination. Notably, enhancing meningeal lymphangiogenesis through adeno-associated virus delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) mitigates microglial gliosis and white matter demyelination. Conversely, blocking the growth of mLVs with a VEGF-C trap strategy exacerbates these changes. The findings highlight the role of mLVs and glymphatic pathway dysfunction in aggravating brain white matter injury, providing a potential novel strategy for WMH prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with multiple predisposing factors and complicated pathogenesis. Aβ peptide is one of the most important pathogenic factors in the etiology of AD. Accumulating evidence indicates that the imbalance of Aβ production and Aβ clearance in the brain of AD patients leads to Aβ deposition and neurotoxic Aβ oligomer formation. Melatonin shows a potent neuroprotective effect and can prevent or slow down the progression of AD, supporting the view that melatonin is a potential therapeutic molecule for AD. Melatonin modulates the regulatory network of secretase expression and affects the function of secretase, thereby inhibiting amyloidogenic APP processing and Aβ production. Additionally, melatonin ameliorates Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and probably promotes Aβ clearance through glymphatic-lymphatic drainage, BBB transportation and degradation pathways. In this review, we summarize and discuss the role of melatonin against Aβ-dependent AD pathogenesis. We explore the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of melatonin on Aβ production and assembly, Aβ clearance, Aβ neurotoxicity and circadian cycle disruption. We summarize multiple clinical trials of melatonin treatment in AD patients, showing that melatonin has a promising effect on improving sleep quality and cognitive function. This review aims to stimulate further research on melatonin as a potential therapeutic agent for AD.",

      "abstract": "Recently developed antimigraine therapeutics targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling are effective, though their sites of activity remain elusive. Notably, the lymphatic vasculature is responsive to CGRP signaling, but whether meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) contribute to migraine pathophysiology is unknown. Mice with lymphatic vasculature deficient in the CGRP receptor (CalcrliLEC mice) treated with nitroglycerin-mediated (NTG-mediated) chronic migraine exhibit reduced pain and light avoidance compared with NTG-treated littermate controls. Gene expression profiles of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) isolated from the meninges of Rpl22HA/+;Lyve1Cre RiboTag mice treated with NTG revealed increased MLV-immune interactions compared with cells from untreated mice. Interestingly, the relative abundance of mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1-interacting (MAdCAM1-interacting) CD4+ T cells was increased in the deep cervical lymph nodes of NTG-treated control mice but not in NTG-treated CalcrliLEC mice. Treatment of cultured hLECs with CGRP peptide in vitro induced vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin) rearrangement and reduced functional permeability. Likewise, intra cisterna magna injection of CGRP caused rearrangement of VE-cadherin, decreased MLV uptake of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and impaired CSF drainage in control mice but not in CalcrliLEC mice. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for lymphatics in chronic migraine, whereby CGRP signaling primes MLV-immune interactions and reduces CSF efflux.",

      "title": "Meningeal lymphatic vessels mediate neurotropic viral drainage from the central nervous system.",
      "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that brain meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) act as a drainage path directly into the cervical lymph nodes (CLNs) for macromolecules contained in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, the role of MLVs during CNS viral infection remains unexplored. Here, we found that infection with several neurotropic viruses in mice promotes MLV expansion but also causes impaired MLV-mediated drainage of macromolecules. Notably, MLVs could drain virus from the CNS to CLNs. Surgical ligation of the lymph vessels or photodynamic ablation of dorsal MLVs increased neurological damage and mortality of virus-infected mice. By contrast, pretreatment with vascular endothelial growth factor C promoted expansion of functional MLVs and alleviated the effects of viral infection. Together, these data indicate that functional MLVs facilitate virus clearance, and MLVs represent a critical path for virus spreading from the CNS to the CLNs. MLV-based therapeutic strategies may thus be useful for alleviating infection-induced neurological damage.",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) was once perceived as entirely shielded from the immune system, protected behind the blood-brain barrier and thought to lack lymphatic drainage. However, recent evidence has challenged many dogmas in neuroimmunology. Indeed, by means of glymphatics, brain-derived \"waste\" from deep within the CNS mobilizes toward immunologically active brain borders, where meningeal lymphatic vessels are appropriately positioned to drain antigens from the brain to the periphery. Accordingly, the presentation of brain-derived self-peptides emerges at the brain's borders and drives T cell responses with suppressive properties, critical in allowing active immunosurveillance while limiting aberrant immune reactivity. Taking into consideration these concepts, we further discuss how inflammation, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases potentially reshape the repertoire of self-antigens and immune cells, disrupting the healthy dialogue between the CNS and immune system. Collectively, this evolving perspective unveils new therapeutic avenues for CNS pathologies.",

      "abstract": "In the musculoskeletal system, lymphatic vessels (LVs), which are interdigitated with blood vessels, travel and form an extensive transport network. Blood vessels in bone regulate osteogenesis and hematopoiesis, however, whether LVs in bone affect fracture healing is unclear. Here, we investigate the lymphatic draining function at the tibial fracture sites using near-infrared indocyanine green lymphatic imaging (NIR-ICG) and discover that lymphatic drainage insufficiency (LDI) starts on day one and persists for up to two weeks following the fracture in male mice. Sufficient lymphatic drainage facilitates fracture healing in male mice. Furthermore, we identify that lymphatic platelet thrombosis (LPT) blocks the draining lymphoid sinus and LVs, causes LDI, and inhibits fracture healing in male mice, which can be rescued by a blood thinner. Moreover, unblocked lymphatic drainage decreases neutrophils and increases M2-type macrophages of the hematoma niche to support osteoblast (OB) survival and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) proliferation via transporting damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in male rats. Lymphatic platelet thrombolysis also benefits senile fracture healing in female mice. These findings demonstrate that LPT limits bone regeneration by impeding lymphatic transporting DAMPs. Together, these findings represent a way forward in the treatment of bone repair.",

Meningeal lymphatics are essential for drainage of molecules in the cerebrospinal fluid to the peripheral immune system. Their potential role in depression-like behaviour has not been investigated. Here, we show in mice, sub-chronic variable stress as a model of depression-like behaviour impairs meningeal lymphatics in females but not in males. Manipulations of meningeal lymphatics regulate the sex difference in the susceptibility to stress-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice, as well as alterations of the medial prefrontal cortex and the ventral tegmental area, brain regions critical for emotional regulation. Together, our findings suggest meningeal lymphatic impairment contributes to susceptibility to stress in mice, and that restoration of the meningeal lymphatics might have potential for modulation of depression-like behaviour.",

Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of functional lymphatics are not fully understood, the interplay between lymphangiogenesis and immune regulation has recently been explored in relation to the initiation and development of these diseases. In this field, experimental therapeutic strategies targeting lymphangiogenesis have shown promise by reducing myocardial inflammation, edema and fibrosis, and improving cardiac function. On the other hand, however, whether lymphangiogenesis is beneficial or detrimental to cardiac transplant survival remains controversial. In the light of recent evidence, cardiac lymphangiogenesis, a thriving and challenging field has been summarized and discussed, which may improve our knowledge in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and transplant biology.",

      "abstract": "The 5 most important pillars of conservative lymphoedema therapy are (1) compression, (2) manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), (3) exercise, (4) skin and wound care, and (5) self-management. Without compression therapy the risk of cellulitis is increased and causes an elevated health/economic burden. The use of nocturnal compression shows advantages and a high degree of treatment adherence. The previous recommendation that compression should not be used for cellulitis has been cancelled. On the contrary, compression therapy is explicitly desirable for inflammatory dermatoses. The fact that lymphedema extremities show a 3-fold higher association with malignant skin tumours compared to unaffected extremities deserves attention. Using ICG lymphography, 4 different functional regions of lymphatic leg bundles were differentiated. The severity of the lymphoedema correlated with the kind of affected bundles. Vascularized lymph node transfer, which is a reconstructive lymphatic surgery procedure, was found to show evidence in terms of volume reduction, improved functionality, and better quality of life. The higher the BMI, the higher the risk of developing lymphoedema. Meta-analyses confirm the benefits of an active lifestyle with exercise and sporting activities in conjunction with patient education. Apparative systems for decongestion (intermittent pneumatic compression) usually force patients to remain immobile during application. Portable apparative compression systems are a promising alternative but are not yet available in Germany. Primary lymphoedema is not a uniform entity. The St. George's classification system shows the association of primary lymphoedema with systemic or syndromic diseases and vascular malformations as well. As a work-in-progress algorithm, it is a valuable aid in classifying primary lymphoedema, confirming the diagnosis and finding therapeutic approaches.",

It is therefore not surprising that the list of human diseases associated with lymphatic malfunctions has grown larger, including issues beyond lymphedema, a pathology traditionally associated with lymphatic drainage insufficiency. Thus, the discovery of factors and pathways that can promote optimal lymphatic functions may offer new therapeutic options. Accumulating evidence indicates that aside from biochemical factors, biomechanical signals also regulate lymphatic vessel expansion and functions postnatally.

Recent evidence suggests that meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) contribute significantly to the drainage of cerebrospinal and interstitial fluid. Deep cervical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA), a microsurgical technique designed to enhance this drainage, has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. Preliminary findings from exploratory studies in China indicate possible cognitive and biomarker improvements, but current evidence is limited by small sample sizes, non-randomized designs, and methodological variability. Without standardized protocols and rigorous clinical validation, the broader applicability of LVA remains uncertain. Further investigation through multicenter, controlled trials is essential to objectively assessing its safety, efficacy, and clinical relevance in the management of AD.",

      "title": "The lymphatic drainage systems in the brain: a novel target for ischemic stroke?",
      "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed three lymphatic drainage systems in the brain, that is, the glymphatic system, the intramural periarterial drainage pathway, and meningeal lymphatic vessels, whose roles in various neurological diseases have been widely explored. The glymphatic system is a fluid drainage and waste clearance pathway that utilizes perivascular space and aquaporin-4 protein located in the astrocyte endfeet to provide a space for exchange of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. The intramural periarterial drainage pathway drives the flow of interstitial fluid through the capillary basement membrane and the arterial tunica media. Meningeal lymphatic vessels within the dura mater are involved in the removal of cerebral macromolecules and immune responses. After ischemic stroke, impairment of these systems could lead to cerebral edema, accumulation of toxic factors, and activation of neuroinflammation, while restoration of their normal functions can improve neurological outcomes. In this review, we summarize the basic concepts of these drainage systems, including drainage routes, physiological functions, regulatory mechanisms, and detection technologies. We also focus on the roles of lymphatic drainage systems in brain injury after ischemic stroke, as well as recent advances in therapeutic strategies targeting these drainage systems. These findings provide information for potential novel strategies for treatment of stroke.",

However, since its early symptoms are inconclusive in addition to the complexity of the pathological basis, there is a rather limited effective therapies and interventions. Recently, accumulating evidence suggested that various brain-waste-clearance dysfunctions are closely related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of CSVD, and after a comprehensive and systematic review we classified them into two broad categories: trans-barrier transport and lymphatic drainage. The former includes blood brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, and the latter, glymphatic-meningeal lymphatic system and intramural periarterial drainage pathway. We summarized the concepts and potential mechanisms of these clearance systems, proposing a relatively complete framework for elucidating their interactions with CSVD. In addition, we also discussed recent advances in therapeutic strategies targeting clearance dysfunction, which may be an important area for future CSVD research.",

      "title": "Dietary recommendations for prevention of atherosclerosis.",
      "abstract": "This review aims at summarizing updated evidence on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk associated with consumption of specific food items to substantiate dietary strategies for atherosclerosis prevention. A systematic search on PubMed was performed to identify meta-analyses of cohort studies and RCTs with CVD outcomes. The evidence is highly concordant in showing that, for the healthy adult population, low consumption of salt and foods of animal origin, and increased intake of plant-based foods-whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts-are linked with reduced atherosclerosis risk. The same applies for the replacement of butter and other animal/tropical fats with olive oil and other unsaturated-fat-rich oil. Although the literature reviewed overall endorses scientific society dietary recommendations, some relevant novelties emerge. With regard to meat, new evidence differentiates processed and red meat-both associated with increased CVD risk-from poultry, showing a neutral relationship with CVD for moderate intakes. Moreover, the preferential use of low-fat dairies in the healthy population is not supported by recent data, since both full-fat and low-fat dairies, in moderate amounts and in the context of a balanced diet, are not associated with increased CVD risk; furthermore, small quantities of cheese and regular yogurt consumption are even linked with a protective effect. Among other animal protein sources, moderate fish consumption is also supported by the latest evidence, although there might be sustainability concerns. New data endorse the replacement of most high glycemic index (GI) foods with both whole grain and low GI cereal foods. As for beverages, low consumption not only of alcohol, but also of coffee and tea is associated with a reduced atherosclerosis risk while soft drinks show a direct relationship with CVD risk. This review provides evidence-based support for promoting appropriate food choices for atherosclerosis prevention in the general population.",

      "title": "Tallow, Rendered Animal Fat, and Its Biocompatibility With Skin: A Scoping Review.",
      "abstract": "There is a surge in the skincare industry marketing the use of natural ingredients as efficacious agents. Although this has been popular in the Eastern hemisphere for a while, Western countries are starting to put more emphasis on naturally derived products. This paper chose to analyze the current research available on tallow, which is a solid fat derived from animals. Tallow has long been used as a neutral cooking fat, ingredient in soaps, biofuel product, and now ingredient in skincare products. The purpose of this scoping review was to look at the current research pertaining to the therapeutic benefits of tallow on the skin. Using the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, a scoping review was conducted using two databases: EMBASE and PubMed as sources of evidence. The searches for studies were conducted using the following key terms: (tallow) AND (skin or dermatology or dermatitis or emulsion or cosmetics or eczema). Papers were excluded if they were not in English, if they did not mention the effects of tallow on the skin, and if they did not use tallow rendered from an animal. Date ranges and geographical locations for articles were not part of our inclusion or exclusion criteria. We focused on the following five research questions: Does the composition of tallow make it better suitable for use on skin? What is the benefit of using tallow on skin? Does tallow have therapeutic properties for skin conditions? What side effects does tallow have on the skin? Is tallow reef-safe? While there is much evidence supporting the use of tallow as an ingredient in animal feed, cooking, soaps, and biofuels, there are significant research gaps in how it can be used on human skin. Our search on PubMed and EMBASE resulted in a total of 147 studies being screened with 19 fitting our specific criteria. Of the 19 studies, there were comparative studies, basic science studies, and animal studies. After reviewing the studies to answer the objectives in this paper, we were able to find information that supported the first three objectives; however, more research is still needed. Specifically, more research is needed that is geared towards tallow as a cosmetic product in humans. The fourth objective, which was to answer the side effects of topical tallow, had the most discrepancies between the sources. The fifth objective also found supporting information; however, only two sources were found. Overall, there needs to be more research with controlled variables on the side effects of topical tallow. Different research designs that could be explored include case studies, randomized controlled trials, cross-sectional studies, and qualitative studies.",

      "title": "Saturated Fatty Acid Chain Length and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of saturated fatty acid chain lengths on the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The importance of replacement macronutrients is also discussed. PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane library were searched for relevant prospective cohort studies that measured SFA chain length via diet analysis through October of 2020. A second updated PubMed search was conducted from October 2020 to 7 August 2022. Five prospective cohort studies were added. All studies used food frequency questionnaires to assess dietary intake. For all five added studies, the main sources of saturated fat were palmitic and steric acid from meat and cheese. Most studies discovered an association with increased risk of CVD and long-chain saturated fatty acid intake, as well as a neutral (potentially beneficial) association with short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids. Isocaloric substitutions were associated with a higher risk for CVD when saturated fats were replaced with refined carbohydrates and protein from meat, but a reduced or neutral impact when relaced with plant-based protein, unsaturated fat, or complex carbohydrates. When examining the impact of diet on CVD risk, it is critical to consider the macronutrient replacing saturated fat as well as the saturated fat chain length, whole foods, and diet patterns on CVD risk. The studies included in this review suggest that LCSFA (C12-18) may increase the risk for CVD development, while SCFA and MCFA (C4--C10) may be more beneficial or neutral.",

      "abstract": "The 2-component molecular-level model dividing body mass into fat and fat-free mass (FFM) is a cornerstone of contemporary body composition research across multiple disciplines. Confusion prevails, however, as the term lean body mass (LBM) is frequently used interchangeably with FFM in scientific discourse. Are LBM and FFM the same or different body components? Captain Albert R. Behnke originated the LBM concept in 1942 and he argued that his \"physiological\" LBM component included \"essential\" fat or structural lipids whereas FFM is a chemical entity \"free\" of fat. Classical experimental animal and human studies conducted during Behnke's era laid the foundation for the widely used body density and total body water 2-component molecular-level body composition models. Refined body composition models, organization of lipids into structural and functional groupings, and lipid extraction methods all have advanced since Behnke's era. Our review provides an in-depth analysis of these developments with the aim of clarifying distinctions between the chemical composition of LBM and FFM. Our retrospective analysis reveals that FFM, derived experimentally as the difference between body weight and extracted neutral or nonpolar lipids (mainly triglycerides), includes polar or structural lipids (that is, Behnke's \"essential\" fat). Accordingly, LBM as originally proposed by Behnke has the same chemical composition as FFM, thus answering a longstanding ambiguity in the body composition literature. Bringing body composition science into the modern era mandates the use of the chemically correct term FFM with the elimination of the duplicative term LBM that today has value primarily in a historical context. Avoiding the use of the term LBM additionally limits confusion surrounding similar widely used body composition terms such as lean mass, lean soft tissue mass, and lean muscle mass.",

      "title": "Long-term high-fat diet consumption by mice throughout adulthood induces neurobehavioral alterations and hippocampal neuronal remodeling accompanied by augmented microglial lipid accumulation.",
      "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) consumption is generally associated with an increased risk of cognitive and emotional dysfunctions that constitute a sizeable worldwide health burden with profound social and economic consequences. Middle age is a critical time period that affects one's health later in life; pertinently, the prevalence of HFD consumption is increasing among mature adults. Given the growing health-related economic burden imposed globally by increasing rates of noncommunicable diseases in rapidly aging populations, along with the pervasive but insidious health impairments associated with HFD consumption, it is critically important to understand the effects of long-term HFD consumption on brain function and to gain insights into their potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, adult male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned a control diet (CD, 10 kJ% from fat) or an HFD (60 kJ% from fat) for 6 months (6 M) or 9 months (9 M) followed by behavioral tests, serum biochemical analysis, and histological examinations of both the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampus. In both the 6 M and 9 M cohorts, mice that consumed an HFD exhibited poorer memory performance in the Morris water maze test (MWM) and greater depression- and anxiety-like behavior during the open field test (OFT), sucrose preference test (SPT) and forced swim test (FST) than control mice. Compared with age-matched mice in the CD group, mice in the HFD group showed abnormal hippocampal neuronal morphology, which was particularly evident in the ventral hippocampus. Hippocampal microglia in mice in the HFD group generally had a more activated phenotype evidenced by a smaller microglial territory area and increased cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68, a marker of phagocytic activity) immunoreactivity, while the microglial density in the dentate gyrus (DG) was decreased, indicating microglial decline. The engulfment of postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95, a general postsynaptic marker) puncta by microglia was increased in the HFD groups. Histological analysis of neutral lipids using a fluorescent probe (BODIPY) revealed that the total neutral lipid content in regions of interests (ROIs) and the lipid load in microglia were increased in the HFD group relative to the age-matched CD group. In summary, our results demonstrated that chronic HFD consumption from young adulthood to middle age induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior as well as memory impairment. The negative influence of chronic HFD consumption on behavioral and hippocampal neuroplasticity appears to be linked to a change in microglial phenotype that is accompanied by a remarkable increase in cellular lipid accumulation. These observations highlighting the potential to target lipid metabolism deficits to reduce the risk of HFD-associated emotional dysfunctions.",

LDs have a unique structure comprising of a hydrophobic core of neutral lipids (fat), triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol esters (CE) surrounded by a phospholipid monolayer. LD surface is decorated by a multitude of proteins and enzymes rendering this compartment functional. Accumulating evidence suggests that LDs originate from discrete ER-subdomains, demarcated by the lipodystrophy protein seipin, however, the mechanisms of which are not well understood. LD biogenesis factors together with biophysical properties of the ER membrane orchestrate spatiotemporal regulation of LD nucleation and growth at specific ER subdomains in response to metabolic cues. Defects in LD formation manifests in several human pathologies, including obesity, lipodystrophy, ectopic fat accumulation, and insulin resistance. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular events during initial stages of eukaryotic LD assembly and discuss the critical role of factors that ensure fidelity of this process.",

      "title": "Milk Fat Globules: 2024 Updates.",
      "abstract": "Milk fat globules (MFGs) are a remarkable example of nature's ingenuity. Human milk (HM) carries contains 3-5% fat, 0.8-0.9% protein, 6.9-7.2% carbohydrate calculated as lactose, and 0.2% mineral constituents. Most of these nutrients are carried in these MFGs, which are composed of an energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) core surrounded by a triple membrane structure. The membrane contains polar lipids, specialized proteins, glycoproteins, and cholesterol. Each of these bioactive components serves important nutritional, immunological, neurological, and digestive functions. These MFGs are designed to release energy rapidly in the upper gastrointestinal tract and then persist for some time in the gut lumen so that the protective bioactive molecules are conveyed to the colon. These properties may shape the microbial colonization and innate immune properties of the developing gastrointestinal tract. Milk fat globules in milk from humans and ruminants may resemble in structure but there are considerable differences in size, profile, composition, and specific constituents. There are possibilities to not only enhance the nutritional composition in a goal-oriented fashion to correct specific deficiencies in the infant but also to use these fat globules as a nutraceutical in infants who require specific treatments. To mention a few, there might be possibilities in enhancing neurodevelopment, in defense against gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections, improving insulin sensitivity, treating chronic inflammation, and altering plasma lipids. This review provides an overview of the composition, structure, and biological activities of the various components of the MFGs. We have assimilated research findings from our own laboratory with an extensive review of the literature utilizing key terms in multiple databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Direct. To avoid bias in the identification of studies, keywords were short-listed a priori from anecdotal experience and PubMed's Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) thesaurus.",

      "title": "Lipid Droplets in Cancer.",
      "abstract": "Lipid droplets have a unique structure among organelles consisting of a dense hydrophobic core of neutral lipids surrounded by a single layer of phospholipids decorated with various proteins. Often labeled merely as passive fat storage repositories, they in fact have a remarkably dynamic life cycle. Being formed within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, lipid droplets rapidly grow, shrink, traverse the cytosol, and engage in contacts with other organelles to exchange proteins and lipids. Their lipid and protein composition changes dynamically in response to cellular states and nutrient availability. Remarkably, their biogenesis is induced when cells experience various forms of nutrient, energy, and redox imbalances, including lipid excess and complete nutrient deprivation. Cancer cells are continuously exposed to nutrient and oxygen fluctuations and have the capacity to switch between alternative nutrient acquisition and metabolic pathways in order to strive even during severe stress. Their supply of lipids is ensured by a series of nutrient uptake and scavenging mechanisms, upregulation of de novo lipid synthesis, repurposing of their structural lipids via enzymatic remodeling, or lipid recycling through autophagy. Importantly, most of these pathways of lipid acquisition converge at lipid droplets, which combine different lipid fluxes and control their usage based on specific cellular needs. It is thus not surprising that lipid droplet breakdown is an elaborately regulated process that occurs via a complex interplay of neutral lipases and autophagic degradation. Cancer cells employ lipid droplets to ensure energy production and redox balance, modulate autophagy, drive membrane synthesis, and control its composition, thereby minimizing stress and fostering tumor progression. As regulators of (poly)unsaturated fatty acid trafficking, lipid droplets are also emerging as modulators of lipid peroxidation and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Clearly, dysregulated lipid droplet turnover may also be detrimental to cancer cells, which should provide potential therapeutic opportunities in the future. In this review, we explore how lipid droplets consolidate lipid acquisition and trafficking pathways in order to match lipid supply with the requirements for cancer cell survival, growth, and metastasis.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for muscle loss and sarcopenia. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) or \"gliflozins\" are one of the newest anti-hyperglycemic drugs. They reduce blood glucose levels by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption in the early proximal convoluted tubule. Various randomized trials showed that SGLT2i have cardio-protective and reno-protective action. SGLT2i also affect body composition. They usually decrease body fat percentage, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, regarding the muscle mass, there are conflicting findings some studies showing detrimental effects and others showed neutral or beneficial effects. This issue is extremely important not only because of the wide use of SGLT2i around globe; but also skeletal muscle mass consumes large amounts of calories during exercise and is an important determinant of resting metabolic rate and skeletal muscle loss hinders energy consumption leading to obesity. In this systematic review, we extensively reviewed the experimental and clinical studies regarding the impact of SGLT2i on muscle mass and related metabolic alterations. Importantly, studies are heterogeneous and there is unmet need to highlight the alterations in muscle during SGLT2i use.",

LDs are formed at the endoplasmic reticulum and have diverse roles in lipid storage, energy metabolism, membrane trafficking, and cellular signaling. In addition to their physiological cellular functions, LDs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including metabolic disorders, cancer, and infections. A number of intracellular bacterial pathogens modulate and/or interact with LDs during host cell infection. Members of the genera Mycobacterium, Legionella, Coxiella, Chlamydia, and Salmonella exploit LDs as a source of intracellular nutrients and membrane components to establish their distinct intracellular replicative niches. In this review, we focus on the biogenesis, interactions, and functions of LDs, as well as on their role in lipid metabolism of intracellular bacterial pathogens.",

      "abstract": "Most current dietary guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) recommend the consumption of low-fat dairy in place of regular-fat dairy foods, one of the main sources of dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Here, we summarize the data presented and discussions held-relating to the validity of such recommendations-between a panel of international nutrition research experts at a high-level closed workshop on \"Saturated Fat in Dairy and Cardiovascular Diseases,\" which took place in Amsterdam on 15-16 April, 2024. The most recent evidence indicates that overall, consumption of milk, yogurt and cheese, irrespective of fat content, is neutrally associated with CVD risk. There is also no evidence yet from randomized controlled trials that consumption of regular-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese has different effects on a broad array of cardiometabolic risk factors when compared with consumption of low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. Thus, the body of evidence does not support differentiation between regular-fat and low-fat dairy foods in dietary guidelines for both adults and children. Strategies focusing primarily on reduction of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, the main source of SFAs in Western diets, rather than on the fat content of dairy foods, are more likely to benefit the population's cardiovascular health. Future research is needed to understand better the place of regular-fat and low-fat dairy foods within healthy eating patterns.",

      "abstract": "The transgender (trans) population includes individuals with gender identities more fittingly aligned with the opposite sex or with an alternative that transcends the classical dipole of male/female. Hormonal treatment in transgender individuals aims to suppress the secretion of endogenous sex steroids and replace them with the steroids of the desired gender. The mainstay of gender-affirming treatment in transgender males is testosterone, whereas for transgender females it is estrogen, usually combined with an anti-androgen or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist if testes are present. Testosterone and estrogen are involved in carbohydrate metabolism via direct effects on skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, and immune cells and indirectly through changes in body fat mass and distribution. The effect of transgender treatment on glucose tolerance is not clear. The provided conflicting results demonstrate a positive, neutral, or even negative association between exogenous testosterone and insulin sensitivity in trans men. Studies show that feminizing hormonal therapy of trans women has mainly an aggravating effect on insulin sensitivity. The existing evidence is not robust and further research is needed to investigate the relationships between body fat distributions, muscle mass, and glycemia/insulin resistance in transgender people under hormonal therapy.",

The complexity of the dairy matrix is associated with a heterogeneous impact on health outcomes from increased, decreased, or neutral effects for specific dairy products and specific health outcomes. Researchers must become more nuanced and systematic in their study of the role of dairy products in health to develop meaningful dietary recommendations. This review of the evidence for the dairy matrix and health points out the dearth of randomized controlled trials and of mechanistic insights.

      "abstract": "Hypercholesterolemia is frequently intertwined with hepatosteatosis, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperglycemia. This study is designed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of miR-206 in contrast to statins in the context of managing hypercholesterolemia in mice. We previously showed that miR-206 is a potent inhibitor of de novo lipogenesis (DNL), cholesterol synthesis, and gluconeogenesis in mice. Given that these processes occur within hepatocytes, we employed a mini-circle (MC) system to deliver miR-206 specifically to hepatocytes (designated as MC-miR-206). A single intravenous injection of MC-miR-206 maintained high levels of miR-206 in the liver for at least two weeks, thereby maintaining suppression of hepatic DNL, cholesterol synthesis, and gluconeogenesis. MC-miR-206 significantly reduced DNA damage, endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress, and hepatic toxicity. Therapeutically, both MC-miR-206 and statins significantly reduced total serum cholesterol and triglycerides as well as LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol in mice maintained on the normal chow and high-fat high-cholesterol diet. MC-miR-206 reduced liver weight, hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol, and blood glucose, while statins slightly increased hepatic cholesterol and blood glucose and failed to affect levels of liver weight and hepatic triglycerides. Mechanistically, miR-206 alleviated hypercholesterolemia by inhibiting hepatic cholesterol synthesis, while statins increased HMGCR activity, hepatic cholesterol synthesis, and fecal-neutral steroid excretion. MiR-206 facilitates the regression of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatosteatosis. MiR-206 outperforms statins by reducing hyperglycemia, hepatic cholesterol levels, and hepatic toxicity.",

They have roles both during oogenesis and in provisioning the developing embryo. In Drosophila, large numbers of LDs are generated in nurse cells during mid-oogenesis and then transferred to oocytes. Their number and spatial distribution changes developmentally and in response to various experimental manipulations. This chapter demonstrates how to visualize LDs in Drosophila follicles, both in fixed tissues and living samples. For fixed samples, the protocol explains how to prepare female flies, dissect ovaries, isolate follicles, fix, apply stains, mount the tissue, and perform imaging. For live samples, the protocol shows how to dissect ovaries, apply a fluorescent LD dye, and culture follicles such that they remain alive and healthy during imaging. Finally, a method is provided that employs in vivo centrifugation to assess colocalization of markers with LDs.",

      "abstract": "Effects of added fat in sow diets on the sows' reproductive performance and offspring growth performance are influenced by multiple factors such as genetics, nutrition, parity, ambient temperatures, and farm management. Individual studies cannot cover all these factors. With the view to address this challenge, we searched all studies that were published from 1986 to 2020, and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the fat effect. In total, 19 papers were collected and analyzed. Fat supplementation in sow diets during late gestation and lactation decreased average daily feed intake (ADFI, P < 0.05) and tended to increase average daily energy intake (ADEI, P = 0.11). It had no impact on litter weights at birth (P = 0.40) or weaning (P = 0.46). It increased total numbers of piglets at birth (P = 0.07), but had no effect on liveborn per litter (P = 0.90) or survival rate (P = 0.48) of piglets to weaning. Fat supplementation had no significant effect on sow body weight loss (P = 0.67) or backfat thickness changes (P = 0.66), but sows fed diets with added fat had increased milk fat concentration (P = 0.03) and shorter wean to estrus intervals (WEI, P = 0.01). In specific circumstances, fat supplementation tended to improve growth performance of piglets with low litter weights at birth (P = 0.14), or when the sows lost large amounts of body weight during lactation (P = 0.11). The level of supplemented fat was 10% and higher would decrease liveborn per litter at neutral temperature (P = 0.10). The meta-analysis revealed that fat supplementation to sows diet during late gestation and lactation can be beneficial for sow reproductive performance and litter growth performance.",

      "abstract": "The sonographic appearance of soft tissue can be altered by trauma and positional change with torsional stress. This creates challenges for ultrasonographic interpretation, because most descriptive literature and standard instructional references are displayed in anatomically neutral or other conventional positions. Knowledge of anatomic alteration and changes in sonographic appearance with torsional stress is essential for accurately assessing soft tissue abnormalities in conditions of spasticity, traumatic and post-surgical changes, and other conditions that distort musculoskeletal relationships. A systematic scanning approach to these alterations is needed for accurate diagnostic interpretation, optimizing electrode placement for electrodiagnostic techniques, effective needle placement for therapeutic ultrasound-guided procedures, and even planning for restorative surgery. This review describes expected positional changes of normal structures with torsional alteration, as well as sonographic recognition of scars, burns, hematomas, fat layer fracture, Morel-Lavallee lesions, abscesses, foreign bodies, myotendinous lesions, muscle injury and denervation, and traumatic peripheral nerve injury.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a complex epidemic disease caused by an imbalance of adipose tissue function that results in hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance which further develop into type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Adipose tissue is responsible for fat storage; white adipose tissue stores excess energy as fat for availability during starvation, whereas brown adipose tissue regulates thermogenesis through fat oxidation using uncoupling protein 1. However, hypertrophic fat storage results in inflammation and increase the chances for obesity which triggers autophagy genes and lipolytic enzymes to regulate lipid metabolism. Autophagy degrades cargo molecule with the help of lysosome and redistributes the energy back to the cell. Autophagy regulates adipocyte differentiation by modulating master regulators of adipogenesis. Adipogenesis is the process which stores excessive energy in the form of lipid droplets. Lipid droplets (LD) are dynamic cellular organelles that store toxic free-fatty acids into neutral triglycerides in adipose tissue. LD activates both lipolysis and lipophagy to degrade excess triglycerides. In obese tissue, autophagy is activated via pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by surplus fat stored in the adipose tissue. This review focused on the process of autophagy and adipogenesis and the transcription factors that regulate lipogenesis and lipolysis in the adipose tissue. We have also discussed about the importance of autophagic regulation within adipose tissue which controls the onset of obesity and its associated diseases.",

      "title": "Symposium review: Physical characterization of feeds and development of the physically effective fiber system.",
      "abstract": "Historical research had shown that forage particle size influences chewing activity, ruminal pH, volatile fatty acid profiles, and milk fat percentage. With this in mind, Mertens in 1997 published one of the most frequently cited papers in the Journal of Dairy Science that laid out a comprehensive system for integrating neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and particle size of feeds into one measure: physically effective NDF (peNDF). Based on total chewing time (i.e., eating plus ruminating), peNDF enabled ration formulation to meet the minimum fiber requirements of ruminants to maintain ruminal pH and milk fat. Total chewing time is related to feed NDF content and particle size, so Mertens proposed that peNDF could be determined simply from a chemical measure of NDF and particle size measured as the fraction of dry matter retained on a 1.18-mm sieve with vertical shaking of a dried sample. In the past 2 decades, the peNDF system has been incorporated into nutrition models and is routinely used in ration formulation. Early on, Mertens recognized that starch would affect the minimum peNDF requirements, and his work was the first to demonstrate that starch and fermentation pH affect ruminal fiber degradation kinetics. Subsequently, Mertens's insight into particle size analysis was extended from fibrous feeds to corn silage processing with the development of the commonly used corn silage fragmentation index for assessing starch availability. Participants at the 33rd Discover Conference on fiber in 2017 ranked improved physical description of feeds as a top priority for future research, undoubtedly recognizing the need to carry forward Mertens's pioneering work. Future research will likely focus on improving the physicochemical and biological evaluation of rumen fiber degradation and passage, thereby improving the prediction of animal response. The comprehensive system that David Mertens built for meeting the fiber requirements of ruminants has transformed ration formulation.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to characterize total-tract nutrient digestibility, energy balance, and N balance in the critical dietary and metabolic transitions of the lactation cycle. Twelve dairy cows were housed in tiestalls from 10 wk before to 16 wk after parturition. After 2 wk of adaptation to the facility and diet, digestibility of organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), starch, and N were measured, and energy and N balances determined at weekly intervals by total collection of feces, urine, and milk over 48 h. Cows were individually fed ad libitum a grass silage- and corn silage-based total mixed ration during lactation and a corn silage- and barley straw-based total mixed ration during the dry period. Effects of stage of lactation were evaluated by clustering week in 5 groups: late lactation (wk -8 to -7), dry period (wk -6 to -1), and 3 early lactation periods (wk 1 to 5, wk 6 to 10, and wk 11 to 16). In lactation, apparent total-tract digestibility of OM, NDF, and starch was lowest in the first 5 wk of lactation. From wk 2 to 16 after parturition, apparent nutrient digestibility of all nutrients increased linearly, but with a negative quadratic component for dry matter, OM, and NDF, to levels comparable to those reported in last 2 wk of the previous lactation. However, differences in digestibility across lactation stage were moderate, illustrated by the difference between OM digestibility in late lactation (last 2 wk, 74.8%) and early lactation (first 5 wk, 72.5%). Cows were in negative energy balance for the first 8 wk after calving, and in negative N balance for the first 4 wk after calving. Based on energy and N balance, we predicted that 36.5 kg of body fat and 3.5 kg of body protein were gained in the last 8 wk before calving, and that 47.5 kg of body fat and 7.6 kg of body protein were mobilized in the first weeks of lactation. These predicted changes in body mass, both the gain before calving and loss after calving, were greater by 37% and 10%, respectively, than fluctuations in measured body weight (corrected for predicted gut fill and fetus weights). At wk 1 and 2 postpartum, body N loss corresponded to 25 and 29%, respectively, of total N excretion in milk, and body energy loss corresponded to 64% and 44%, respectively, of the energy exported to milk, illustrating the important contribution of N and energy from body stores to milk production in early lactation. Metabolic N efficiency, measured as total N output (milk and body) over digestible N input (from diet and body), averaged 54.4% in the last 2 wk of lactation, increased to 65.9% 2 wk after calving, and decreased linearly as lactation advanced to 61.9% by wk 16. Short (48 h) but weekly repetition of total collection of feces and urine appears to be a suitable approach to evaluate temporal changes in nutrient digestibility, energy balance, and N balance across lactation and the dry period.",

      "abstract": "Flaxseed contains significant concentration of mucilage or gum (a type of hydrocolloid). Flaxseed mucilage (FM) predominantly occurs in the outermost layer of the seed's hull and is known to possess numerous health benefits such as delayed gastric emptying, reduced serum cholesterol, and improved glycemic control. FM is typically composed of an arabinoxylan (neutral in nature) and a pectic-like material (acidic in nature). Similar to gum arabic, FM exhibits good water-binding capacity and rheological properties (similar functionality); therefore, FM can be used as its replacement in foods. In this review, an overview of methods used for FM extraction and factors influencing the extraction yield were discussed initially. Thereafter, food applications of FM as gelling agent/gel-strengthening agent, structure-forming agent, stabilizing agent, fat replacer, anti-retrogradation agent, prebiotic, encapsulating agent, edible coatings and films/food packaging material, and emulsifier/emulsion stabilizer were included. At the end, some limitations to its wide application and potential solutions were added.",

      "title": "Pitfalls and challenges of the purinergic signaling cascade in obesity.",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a worldwide health problem which have reached pandemic proportions, now also including low and middle-income countries. Excessive or abnormal fat deposition in the abdomen especially in the visceral compartment is tightly associated with a high metabolic risk for arterial hypertension, type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders (especially articular degeneration) and some cancers. Contrariwise, accumulation of fat in the subcutaneous compartment has been associated with a neutral metabolic impact, favoring a lower risk of insulin resistance. Obesity results more often from an avoidable imbalance between food consumption and energy expenditure. There are several recommended strategies for dealing with obesity, including pharmacological therapies, but their success remains incomplete and may not compensate the associated adverse effects. Purinergic signaling operated by ATP and its metabolite, adenosine, has attracted increasing attention in obesity. The extracellular levels of purines often reflect the energy status of a given cell population. Adenine nucleotides and nucleosides fine tuning control adipogenesis and mature adipocytes function via the activation of P2 and P1 purinoceptors, respectively. These features make the purinergic signaling cascade a putative target for therapeutic intervention in obesity and related metabolic syndromes. There are, however, gaps in our knowledge regarding the role of purines in adipocyte precursors differentiation and mature adipocytes functions, as well as their impact among distinct adipose tissue deposits (e.g. white vs. brown, visceral vs. subcutaneous), which warrants further investigations before translation to clinical trials can be made.",

SLC3A2 plays a role on both sides of this dichotomy as an adaptor to SLC7A5, a transporter of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA: Leu, Ile, Val), and to SLC7A11, a cystine importer supplying cysteine to the synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione. Endurance in mammalian muscle depends in part on oxidation of BCAA; however, elevated serum levels are associated with insulin resistance and shortened lifespans.

      "abstract": "'Feeling fat' refers to the subjective experience of carrying excess weight and relates to severity of eating pathology. Despite research suggesting that 'feeling fat' fluctuates across contexts, this construct is almost exclusively assessed in terms of frequency or as a trait. Examining state 'feeling fat' in response to external stimuli can inform us of the nature of this construct. In an experimental study, 290 community women were exposed to five categories of affective (pleasant, aversive, and neutral) and body (thin and non-thin) images in quasi-random order. Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) valence and arousal rating scales as well as a novel SAM 'feeling fat' scale were rated for each image. Theoretically-relevant constructs (i.e., trait 'feeling fat', thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, eating pathology) were also measured. Body images elicited greater state 'feeling fat' than affective images, with images of non-thin bodies producing higher state 'feeling fat' than thin bodies. Positive correlations were observed between state 'feeling fat' in response to thin and all variables of interest, whereas associations between these variables and 'feeling fat' in response to non-thin images were small or non-significant. The development of a state measure of 'feeling fat' allows for the investigation of triggers of this bodily experience and will facilitate future research.",

Compared with single polysaccharide, the combined polysaccharide showed synergistic effect on formulating the non-fat whipped cream with better properties. The non-fat whipped creams showed high overrun (up to 570 %), excellent drainage stability (no drainage occurred within 120 min) and comparable hardness (up to 1.1 N) than that of control (a commercially dairy whipped cream). Moreover, the non-fat whipped creams were all solid-like (storage modulus > loss modulus) and exhibited outstanding shape retention ability. These properties were greatly affected by the types and ratios of combined polysaccharide. The combination of anionic and neutral polysaccharides was more beneficial for its properties, and the effect depended on the combined ratios. Especially for samples containing gellan gum/guar gum, their appearance only changed slightly after standing for 60 min, and simultaneously showed satisfying sensory acceptability when the combined ratio was 2/3. Therefore, these novel non-fat whipped creams could be popularized as the functional products aiming at specific groups such as diabetes and obesity people in the future.",

As comparison groups, normal birthweight (NBW) piglets were fed a CHF (NBW-CHF) or standard pig grower diet (NBW-Chow). A total of 35 pigs completed the study and were fed for a total of 7 weeks, including 1 week of CHF transition diet. At 12 weeks of age, piglets were euthanized.

      "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are commonly found in various biological cells and are organelles related to cell metabolism. LDs, the number and size of which are heterogeneous across cell type, are primarily composed of polar lipids and proteins on the surface with neutral lipids in the core. Neutral lipids stored in LDs can be degraded by lipolysis and lipophagocytosis, which are regulated by various proteins. The process of LD formation can be summarized in four steps. In addition to energy production, LDs play an extremely pivotal role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid toxicity, storage of fat-soluble vitamins, regulation of oxidative stress, and reprogramming of cell metabolism. Interestingly, LDs, the hub of integration between metabolism and the immune system, are involved in antitumor immunity, anti-infective immunity (viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) and some metabolic immune diseases. Herein, we summarize the role of LDs in several major immune cells as elucidated in recent years, including T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils. Additionally, we analyze the role of the interaction between LDs and immune cells in two typical metabolic immune diseases: atherosclerosis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.",

      "abstract": "Neutral lipids (NLs) are apolar oil molecules synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum bilayer upon diverse biological stimuli. NLs synthesized are released in the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. At a critical concentration, NLs condense by phase separation and nucleate a lipid droplet (LD). After an LD forms, a fraction of NLs can be present in the bilayer but at a concentration below that of the nucleation. Here, we study whether and how the accumulation of NLs alters a lipid bilayer's mechanical properties. In synthetic systems, we found that NLs proffer unusual bilayer stretching capacities, especially in the presence of negatively curved phospholipids. This impact becomes spectacular when an LD is contiguous with the bilayer and supplies it with NLs. The tested NLs markedly decrease the bilayer area expansion modulus and significantly increase lysis tension but had opposite effects on membrane bending rigidity. Our data unveil how NL molecules modify overall membrane mechanics, the alteration of which may be linked to pathologies or anticancer treatments targeting NLs.",

      "title": "Functional Proteins from Biovalorization of Peanut Meal: Advances in Process Technology and Applications.",
      "abstract": "Environmental costs associated with meat production have necessitated researchers and food manufacturers to explore alternative sources of high-quality protein, especially from plant origin. Proteins from peanuts and peanut-by products are high-quality, matching industrial standards and nutritional requirements. This review contributes to recent developments in the production of proteins from peanut and peanut meal. Conventional processing techniques such as hot-pressing kernels, use of solvents in oil removal, and employing harsh acids and alkalis denature the protein and damage its functional properties, limiting its use in food formulations. Controlled hydrolysis (degree of hydrolysis between 1 and 10%) using neutral and alkaline proteases can extract proteins and improve peanut proteins' functional properties, including solubility, emulsification, and foaming activity. Peanut proteins can potentially be incorporated into meat analogues, bread, soups, confectionery, frozen desserts, and cakes. Recently, pretreatment techniques (microwave, ultrasound, high pressure, and atmospheric cold plasma) have been explored to enhance protein extraction and improve protein functionalities. However, most of the literature on physicochemical pretreatment techniques has been limited to the lab scale and has not been analysed at the pilot scale. Peanut-derived peptides also exhibit antioxidant, anti-hypertensive, and anti-thrombotic properties. There exists a potential to incorporate these peptides into high-fat foods to retard oxidation. These peptides can also be consumed as dietary supplements for regulating blood pressure. Further research is required to analyse the sensory attributes and shelf lives of these novel products. In addition, animal models or clinical trials need to be conducted to validate these results on a larger scale.",

      "title": "Determination and prediction of the available energy and amino acids digestibility of full-fat soybean fed to growing pigs.",
      "abstract": "Two experiments were conducted to determine the digestible energy and metabolizable energy contents, as well as the apparent ileal digestibility and standardized ileal digestibility of amino acids in full-fat soybean fed to growing pigs. Ten full-fat soybean samples were collected from different areas in China and used in two experiments in this study. In Exp. 1, 66 growing pigs (initial body weight = 18.48 ± 1.2 kg) were randomly allotted to 1 of 11 diets (n = 6) including a corn basal diet and 10 experimental diets formulated by replacing the corn with 30% full-fat soybean. In Exp. 2, 11 growing pigs (initial body weight = 50.45 ± 3.2 kg) were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and arranged in a 6 × 11 Youden square design with 11 diets and 6 periods. The diets included an N-free diet based on cornstarch and sucrose and 10 experimental diets formulated with full-fat soybeans as the sole source of amino acids. Chromic oxide was added into the diets as an indigestible maker to calculate the digestibility of the amino acids. Results showed that there was considerable variation in neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, and trypsin inhibitor contents in the 10 full-fat soybean samples with a coefficient of variation greater than 10%. On a dry matter basis, the averaged digestible energy and metabolizable energy values in the 10 full-fat soybean samples were 4,855 and 4,555 kcal/kg, respectively, both were positively correlated with the ether extract content. The best-fitted prediction equations for digestible energy and metabolizable energy of full-fat soybean were: digestible energy, kcal/kg = 3,472 + 94.87 × ether extract - 97.63 × ash (R2 = 0.91); metabolizable energy, kcal/kg = 3,443 + 65.11 × ether extract - 36.84 × trypsin inhibitor (R2 = 0.91). In addition, all full-fat soybean samples showed high apparent ileal digestibility and standardized ileal digestibility values in amino acids and were all within the range of previously published values. Those values significantly varied among different samples (P < 0.05) for most amino acids, except for glycine and proline. In conclusion, full-fat soybean is a high-quality protein ingredient with high ileal digestibility of amino acids when fed to growing pigs, and the metabolizable energy value of full-fat soybean could be predicted based on its ether extract and trypsin inhibitor contents.",

      "title": "Dairy foods and cardiometabolic diseases: an update and a reassessment of the impact of SFA.",
      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD are major causes of mortality and chronic morbidity. Whilst mortality from CVD has decreased they remain the largest cause of death in Europe and the prevalence of T2D is increasing rapidly. A consistent component of public health advice is to reduce intake of SFA to reduce CVD in particular, which implies limiting dairy food consumption. The prospective studies and randomised controlled trials included in this review show that for dairy foods at least, SFA are not consistently associated with CVD or T2D risk. For CVD the association with dairy foods is generally neutral despite dairy foods being the major source of SFA in many diets. This creates considerable doubt, at least for dairy foods, concerning the validity of the traditional diet-heart hypothesis which positively relates SFA intake to increased serum LDL-cholesterol and subsequent increased CVD. There is now emerging evidence to explain this which is highly relevant to dairy foods. These include the potentially counterbalancing effect of SFA-stimulated HDL-cholesterol and specific food matrix factors. In addition, SFA are associated with the less atherogenic large buoyant LDL particles and possible counterbalancing hypotensive effects of dairy proteins. Overall, dairy foods have either a neutral or beneficial association with CVD and T2D. Beneficial associations are seen for blood pressure and the reduced T2D risk linked to yoghurt consumption, a subject that needs urgent attention given the sharp rise in T2D prevalence in many countries.",

      "abstract": "This experiment evaluated the effects of roughage levels and supplemental fat on intake, growth performance, health, and physiological responses of newly received finishing cattle during 58-d receiving period. A total of 72 crossbred steers (initial body weight [BW] = 200 ± 13 kg) were used in a randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments, consisting of two roughage levels (wheat hay at 30% [R30] or 60% [R60]; dry matter [DM] basis) and two levels of supplemental fat (yellow grease at 0% [-FAT; no additional fat] or 3.5% [+FAT]; DM basis). Upon arrival, calves were individually weighed, blocked by off-truck shrunk BW, and assigned to 24 soil-surfaced pens (three calves per pen). Shrunk BW was also collected on day 58 for the calculation of average daily gain (ADG). Throughout the study, calves were assessed for bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Effects of roughage level × supplemental fat interaction were only observed for diet particle size distribution and estimated physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) of diets (P ≤ 0.10). Adding fat to R60 diets tended to increase the percentage of particles retained in the 8-mm screen (P = 0.06) and the estimated peNDF (P = 0.10), but did not affect R30 diets. Dietary roughage level did not affect DM intake (DMI; P = 0.85). Calves-fed R30 tended to have greater ADG and final BW than calves-fed R60 (P ≤ 0.08). Gain efficiency (gain:feed ratio; G:F) was greater for calves-fed R30 than calves-fed R60 (P = 0.01). Dietary roughage level did not affect morbidity and mortality (P ≥ 0.11). Supplemental fat did not affect DMI (P = 0.6) but tended (P = 0.09) to increase ADG compared to -FAT diets. The G:F was greater for calves-fed +FAT than -FAT (P = 0.03). The +FAT diet tended (P = 0.10) to increase the number of retreatments against BRD compared to -FAT, although the total number of antimicrobial treatments required to treat sick calves (P = 0.78) and the mortality rate (P = 0.99) were not affected by supplemental fat. Feeding +FAT diet tended (P ≤ 0.09) to increase plasma concentration of cortisol and immunoglobulin-G compared to -FAT. In summary, feeding 30% roughage diets or adding 3.5% yellow grease (DM basis) as supplemental fat increased G:F during the feedlot receiving period.",

      "abstract": "Lipid disorders involving derangements in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, or both are commonly encountered in clinical practice and often have implications for cardiovascular risk and overall health. Recent advances in knowledge, recommendations, and treatment options have necessitated an updated approach to these disorders. Older classification schemes have outlived their usefulness, yielding to an approach based on the primary lipid disturbance identified on a routine lipid panel as a practical starting point. Although monogenic dyslipidemias exist and are important to identify, most individuals with lipid disorders have polygenic predisposition, often in the context of secondary factors such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. With regard to cardiovascular disease, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is essentially causal, and clinical practice guidelines worldwide have recommended treatment thresholds and targets for this variable. Furthermore, recent studies have established elevated triglycerides as a cardiovascular risk factor, whereas depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol now appears less contributory than was previously believed. An updated approach to diagnosis and risk assessment may include measurement of secondary lipid variables such as apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a), together with selective use of genetic testing to diagnose rare monogenic dyslipidemias such as familial hypercholesterolemia or familial chylomicronemia syndrome. The ongoing development of new agents-especially antisense RNA and monoclonal antibodies-targeting dyslipidemias will provide additional management options, which in turn motivates discussion on how best to incorporate them into current treatment algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Whilst dietary cholesterol guidelines have waivered through the years with historic restrictions lifted for the majority of the general population, recommendations to reduce saturated fat intake have been the mainstay of dietary guidelines since the 1980s and were recently reinforced by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). Cholesterol metabolism is complex, with saturated fat known to have a more significant contribution at raising levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, it is clear from metabolic research that hyper-responsiveness to both dietary cholesterol and saturated fat exists; hence, for specific subsets of the population, reductions in both nutrients may be indicated. With this in mind, the current article aims to provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying biological variation in responsiveness and introduces research currently underway which will hopefully identify simple biomarkers that can be used to predict responsiveness and permit tailored, personalised, dietary advice. Eggs are a well-known source of dietary cholesterol whilst being low in saturated fat. A common question encountered in clinical practice is must individuals limit intake to manage blood cholesterol levels. This article summarises key recent papers which confirm that eggs can be enjoyed as part of a healthy balanced diet, whilst highlighting the need for further research in certain population groups, e.g. in individuals with diabetes.",

      "title": "Nutrition interventions for adults with dyslipidemia: A Clinical Perspective from the National Lipid Association.",
      "abstract": "Lifestyle habits can have a profound impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. The National Lipid Association previously published recommendations for lifestyle therapies to manage dyslipidemia. This Clinical Perspective provides an update with a focus on nutrition interventions for the three most common dyslipidemias in adults: 1) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) elevation; 2) triglyceride (TG) elevation, including severe hypertriglyceridemia with chylomicronemia; and 3) combined dyslipidemia, with elevations in both LDL-C and TG levels. Lowering LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are the primary objectives for reducing ASCVD risk. With severe TG elevation (≥500 mg/dL), the primary objective is to prevent pancreatitis and ASCVD risk reduction is secondary. Nutrition interventions that lower LDL-C levels include reducing cholesterol-raising fatty acids and dietary cholesterol, as well as increasing intakes of unsaturated fatty acids, plant proteins, viscous fibers, and reducing adiposity for patients with overweight or obesity. Selected dietary supplements may be employed as dietary adjuncts. Nutrition interventions for all patients with elevated TG levels include restricting intakes of alcohol, added sugars, and refined starches. Additional lifestyle factors that reduce TG levels are participating in daily physical activity and reducing adiposity in patients with overweight or obesity. For patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, an individualized approach is essential. Nutrition interventions for addressing concurrent elevations in LDL-C and TG include a combination of the strategies described for lowering LDL-C and TG. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to facilitate success in making and sustaining dietary changes and the assistance of a registered dietitian nutritionist is highly recommended.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the major mortality cause in developed countries with hypercholesterolaemia being one of the primary modifiable causes. Lifestyle intervention constitutes the first step in cholesterol management and includes dietary modifications along with the use of functional foods and supplements. Functional foods enriched with plant sterols/stanols have become the most widely used nonprescription cholesterol-lowering approach, despite the lack of randomized trials investigating their long-term safety and cardiovascular efficacy. The cholesterol-lowering effect of plant-sterol supplementation is well-established and a potential beneficial impact on other lipoproteins and glucose homeostasis has been described. Nevertheless, experimental and human observational studies investigating the association of phytosterol supplementation or circulating plant sterols with various markers of atherosclerosis and ASCVD events have demonstrated controversial results. Compelling evidence from recent genetic studies have also linked elevated plasma concentrations of circulating plant sterols with ASCVD presence, thus raising concerns about the safety of phytosterol supplementation. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide up-to-date data on the effect of plant sterols/stanols on lipid-modification and cardiovascular outcomes, as well as to discuss any safety issues and practical concerns.",

      "abstract": "Dyslipidemia refers to unhealthy changes in blood lipid composition and is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). Usually, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary goal for dyslipidemia management. However, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) has gained attention as an alternative, reliable goal. It encompasses all plasma lipoproteins like LDL, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), TRL-remnants, and lipoprotein a [Lp(a)] except high-density lipoproteins (HDL). In addition to LDL-C, several other constituents of non-HDL-C have been reported to be atherogenic, aiding the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. They are acknowledged as contributors to residual ASCVD risk that exists in patients on statin therapy with controlled LDL-C levels. Therefore, non-HDL-C is now considered an independent risk factor or predictor for CVD. The popularity of non-HDL-C is attributed to its ease of estimation and non-dependency on fasting status. It is also better at predicting ASCVD risk in patients on statin therapy, and/or in those with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. In addition, large follow-up studies have reported that individuals with higher baseline non-HDL-C at a younger age (<45 years) were more prone to adverse CVD events at an older age, suggesting a predictive ability of non-HDL-C over the long term. Consequently, non-HDL-C is recommended as a secondary goal for dyslipidemia management by most international guidelines. Intriguingly, geographical patterns in recent epidemiological studies showed remarkably high non-HDL-C attributable mortality in high-risk countries. This review highlights the independent role of non-HDL-C in ASCVD pathogenesis and prognosis. In addition, the need for a country-specific approach to dyslipidemia management at the community/population level is discussed. Overall, non-HDL-C can become a co-primary or primary goal in dyslipidemia management.",

      "abstract": "The extracts of red yeast rice (RYR) are currently the most effective cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals. This activity is mainly due to monacolin K, a weak reversible inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, whose daily consumption causes a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol plasma levels up to 15% to 25% within 6 to 8 weeks. The decrease in LDL-cholesterol is accompanied by a proportional decrease in total and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Some trials suggest that RYR use is associated with improvement in endothelial function and arterial stiffness, whereas a long-term study supports its role in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite the statin-like mechanism of action, the risk related to 3 to 10 mg monacolin K taken per day is minimal (mild myalgia in previously severely statin-intolerant subjects). RYR could represent a therapeutic tool to support lifestyle improvement in managing mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in low-risk patients, including those who cannot be treated with statins or other LDL-cholesterol-lowering therapies.",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic condition characterised by the build-up of plaque in the inner lining of the blood vessels and it is the main underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The development of atherosclerosis is associated with the accumulation of cholesterol and inflammation. Although effective therapies exist to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, some patients still experience cardiovascular events due to persistent inflammation, known as residual inflammatory risk (RIR). Researchers have conducted laboratory and animal studies to investigate the measurement and targeting of the inflammatory cascade associated with atherosclerosis, which have yielded promising results. In addition to guideline-directed lifestyle modifications and optimal medical therapy focusing on reducing LDL-C levels, pharmacological interventions targeting inflammation may provide further assistance in preventing future cardiac events. This review aims to explain the mechanisms of inflammation in atherosclerosis, identifies potential biomarkers, discusses available therapeutic options and their strengths and limitations, highlights future advancements, and summarises notable clinical studies. Finally, an evaluation and management algorithm for addressing RIR is presented.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death around the world with various efforts being made to reduce risk in patients through preventive measures. One major method for prevention has been managing cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein to decrease atherosclerotic plaque burden, potentially decreasing future cardiac complications. Statins have been the gold standard therapy for hypercholesterolemia treatment due to their ease of dosing, limited drug interactions, and favorable safety profile. Unfortunately, statin therapy alone is not always effective enough to adequately control a patient's elevated lipid levels and combination therapy may be warranted. Ezetimibe is commonly added to regimens to help augment cholesterol lowering by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol. The recent approval of a combination tablet of high-intensity rosuvastatin and ezetimibe has introduced a potentially more beneficial option for cholesterol management in addition to the only available combination of moderate intensity simvastatin and ezetimibe. We aimed to identify potential beneficial effects of ezetimibe by comparing its use in combination with high-intensity rosuvastatin compared to a statin therapy alone or in combination with moderate intensity simvastatin through a literature review. The current evidence indicated that combination therapy outperformed statin monotherapy in reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and patients were more likely to achieve their target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal level. This suggests rosuvastatin/ezetimibe combination holds a potential place in therapy for patients requiring a more aggressive reduction in cholesterol to help prevent atherosclerotic disease.",

      "abstract": "PCSK9 is a serine protease that regulates plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and cholesterol by mediating the endolysosomal degradation of LDL receptor (LDLR) in the liver. When PCSK9 functions unchecked, it leads to increased degradation of LDLR, resulting in elevated circulatory levels of LDL and cholesterol. This dysregulation contributes to lipid and cholesterol metabolism abnormalities, foam cell formation, and the development of various diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), viral infections, cancer, and sepsis. Emerging clinical and experimental evidence highlights an imperative role for PCSK9 in metabolic anomalies such as hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia, as well as inflammation, and disturbances in mitochondrial homeostasis. Moreover, metabolic hormones - including insulin, glucagon, adipokines, natriuretic peptides, and sex steroids - regulate the expression and circulatory levels of PCSK9, thus influencing cardiovascular and metabolic functions. In this comprehensive review, we aim to elucidate the regulatory role of PCSK9 in lipid and cholesterol metabolism, pathophysiology of diseases such as CVD, infections, cancer, and sepsis, as well as its pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical targeting for therapeutic management of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Management of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is central to preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and key to reducing the risk of ASCVD events. Current guidelines on the management of blood cholesterol recommend statins as first-line therapy for LDL-C reduction according to an individual's ASCVD risk and baseline LDL-C levels. The addition of nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy to statins to achieve intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended for patients at very high risk of ASCVD events, including patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who have not achieved adequate LDL-C lowering with statins alone. Despite guideline recommendations and clinical trial evidence to support the use of lipid-lowering therapies for ASCVD risk reduction, most patients at high or very high risk do not meet LDL-C thresholds. This review explores the challenges associated with LDL-C lowering in contemporary clinical practice and proposes a framework for rethinking the binary definition of ASCVD, shifting from \"primary\" versus \"secondary\" prevention to a \"continuum of risk.\" The approach considers the role of plaque burden and progression in subclinical disease and emphasizes the importance of early risk assessment and treatment for preventing first cardiovascular events. Patients at high risk of ASCVD events who require significant LDL-C lowering should be considered for combination therapies comprising statin and nonstatin agents. Practical guidance for the pharmacological management of elevated LDL-C, both now and in the future, is provided.",

      "abstract": "This National Lipid Association (NLA) Expert Clinical Consensus provides an overview of the physiologic and clinical considerations regarding the role of apolipoprotein B (apoB) measurement to guide clinical care based on the available scientific evidence and expert opinion. ApoB represents the total concentration of atherogenic lipoprotein particles in the circulation and more accurately reflects the atherogenic burden of lipoproteins when compared to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). ApoB is a validated clinical measurement that augments the information found in a standard lipoprotein lipid panel; therefore, there is clinical value in using apoB in conjunction with a standard lipoprotein lipid profile when assessing risk and managing lipid-lowering therapy (LLT). ApoB has been shown to be superior to LDL-C in risk assessment both before and during treatment with LLT. In individuals, there can be discordance between levels of LDL-C and apoB, as well as LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), despite high levels of population-wide correlation. When there is discordance between LDL-C and apoB, or LDL-C and non-HDL-C, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk generally aligns better with apoB or non-HDL-C. Additionally, apoB can be used in tandem with standard lipoprotein lipid measurements to diagnose distinct lipoprotein phenotypes. ApoB testing can inform clinical prognosis and care, as well as enable family cascade screening, when an inherited lipoprotein syndrome is identified. The NLA and other organizations will continue to educate clinicians about the role of apoB measurement in improving clinical risk assessment and dyslipidemia management. An urgent need exists to improve access and reimbursement for apoB testing.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by metabolic dysfunctions and could predict future risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). However, the traditionally defined dichotomous MetS neither reflected MetS severity nor considered demographic variations. Here we develop a continuous, age-sex-ethnicity-specific MetS score based on continuous measures of the five metabolic dysfunctions (waist circumference [WC], triglycerides [TG], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], mean arterial pressure [MAP], and fasting blood glucose [FBG]). We find that the weights of metabolic dysfunctions in the score vary across age-sex-ethnicity-specific subgroups, with higher weights for TG, HDL-C, and WC. Each unit increase in the score is associated with increased risks for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension, and elevated levels of HbA1c, cholesterol, body mass index, and serum uric acid. The score shows high sensitivity and accuracy for detecting CVD-related risk factors and is validated in different geographical regions. Our study would advance early identification of CVD risks and, more broadly, preventive medicine and sustainable development goals.",

      "title": "Bempedoic acid in the management of lipid disorders and cardiovascular risk. 2023 position paper of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP).",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) and the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Substantial reductions in the CVD prevalence have been achieved in recent years by the attenuation of risk factors (particularly hypertension and dyslipidaemias) in primary and secondary prevention. Despite the remarkable success of lipid lowering treatments, and of statins in particular, in reducing the risk of CVD, there is still an unmet clinical need for the attainment of guideline lipid-targets in even 2/3 of patients. Bempedoic acid, the first in-class inhibitor of ATP-citrate lyase presents a new approach to lipid-lowering therapy. By reducing the endogenous production of cholesterol, upstream of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA-reductase, i.e., the target of statins, bempedoic acid reduces circulating plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and major adverse CVD events (MACE). Bempedoic acid has the potential to contribute to the reduction of CVD risk not only as monotherapy, but even further as part of a lipid-lowering combination therapy with ezetimibe, reducing LDL-C cholesterol up to 40%. This position paper of the International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) summarises the recent evidence around the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid and presents practical recommendations for its use, which complement the 'lower-is-better-for-longer' approach to lipid management, which is applied across international guidelines for the management of CVD risk. Practical evidence-based guidance is provided relating to the use of bempedoic acid in atherosclerotic CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, and statin intolerance. Although there are still no sufficient data avilable for the role of bempedoic acid in the primary prevention of CVD, its favourable effects on plasma glucose and inflammatory markers makes this drug a rational choice in the patient-centred care of specific groups of primary prevention.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that chronic stress can enhance the development of multiple human diseases, including cancer. However, the role of chronic stress in esophageal carcinogenesis and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study uncovered that dysregulated cholesterol metabolism significantly promotes esophageal carcinogenesis under chronic stress conditions. Our findings indicate that the persistent elevation of glucocorticoids induced by chronic stress stimulates cholesterol uptake, contributing to esophageal carcinogenesis. The activated glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) enrichment at the promoter region of High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2) facilitates its transcription. As a transcription coactivator, HMGB2 enhances Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Transcription Factor 1 (SREBF1) transcription and regulates cholesterol metabolism through LDL particle uptake into cells via Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR). These results emphasize the significant impact of chronic stress on esophageal carcinogenesis and establish cholesterol metabolism disorder as a crucial link between chronic stress and the development of ESCC. The implications suggest that effectively managing chronic stress may serve as a viable strategy for preventing and treating ESCC.",

      "abstract": "Plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations correlate negatively with the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). According to a widely cited model, HDL elicits its atheroprotective effect through its role in reverse cholesterol transport, which comprises the efflux of cholesterol from macrophages to early forms of HDL, followed by the conversion of free cholesterol (FCh) contained in HDL into cholesteryl esters, which are hepatically extracted from the plasma by HDL receptors and transferred to the bile for intestinal excretion. Given that increasing plasma HDL-cholesterol levels by genetic approaches does not reduce the risk of ASCVD, the focus of research has shifted to HDL function, especially in the context of macrophage cholesterol efflux. In support of the reverse cholesterol transport model, several large studies have revealed an inverse correlation between macrophage cholesterol efflux to plasma HDL and ASCVD. However, other studies have cast doubt on the underlying reverse cholesterol transport mechanism: in mice and humans, the FCh contained in HDL is rapidly cleared from the plasma (within minutes), independently of esterification and HDL holoparticle uptake by the liver. Moreover, the reversibility of FCh transfer between macrophages and HDL has implicated the reverse process - that is, the transfer of FCh from HDL to macrophages - in the aetiology of increased ASCVD under conditions of very high plasma HDL-FCh concentrations.",

      "abstract": "Cellular disruption of lipid and cholesterol metabolism results in pathological processes linked to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Classically, at the transcription stages, the Cholesterol levels are controlled by two cellular pathways. First, the SREBP transcription factor family controls Cholesterol biosynthesis via transcriptional regulation of critical rate-limiting cholesterogenic and lipogenic proteins. Secondly, The LXR/RXR transcription factor family controls cholesterol shuttling via transcriptional regulation of cholesterol transport proteins. In addition, the posttranscriptional control of gene expression of various enzymes and proteins of cholesterol biosynthesis pathways is mediated by small non-coding microRNAs. Regulatory noncoding miRNAs are critical regulators of biological processes, including developmental and metabolic functions. miRNAs function to fine-tune lipid and cholesterol metabolism pathways by controlling the mRNA levels and translation of critical molecules in each pathway. This review discusses the regulatory roles of miRNAs in cholesterol and lipid metabolism via direct and indirect effects on their target genes, including SREBP, LXR, HDL, LDL, and ABCA transporters. We also discuss the therapeutic implications of miRNA functions and their purported role in the potentiation of small molecule therapies.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D and cholesterol metabolism overlap significantly in the pathways that contribute to their biosynthesis. However, our understanding of their independent and co-regulation is limited. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and atherosclerosis, the pathology associated with elevated cholesterol, is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease. It is therefore important to understand vitamin D metabolism as a contributory factor. From the literature, we compile evidence of how these systems interact, relating the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved to the results from observational studies. We also present the first systems biology pathway map of the joint cholesterol and vitamin D metabolisms made available using the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) Markup Language (SBGNML). It is shown that the relationship between vitamin D supplementation, total cholesterol, and LDL-C status, and between latitude, vitamin D, and cholesterol status are consistent with our knowledge of molecular mechanisms. We also highlight the results that cannot be explained with our current knowledge of molecular mechanisms: (i) vitamin D supplementation mitigates the side-effects of statin therapy; (ii) statin therapy does not impact upon vitamin D status; and critically (iii) vitamin D supplementation does not improve cardiovascular outcomes, despite improving cardiovascular risk factors. For (iii), we present a hypothesis, based on observations in the literature, that describes how vitamin D regulates the balance between cellular and plasma cholesterol. Answering these questions will create significant opportunities for advancement in our understanding of cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "Abetalipoproteinemia (ABL) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic pathogenic mutations in the MTTP gene. Deficiency of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) abrogates the assembly of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoprotein in the intestine and liver, resulting in malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins and severe hypolipidemia. Patients with ABL typically manifest steatorrhea, vomiting, and failure to thrive in infancy. The deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins progressively develops into a variety of symptoms later in life, including hematological (acanthocytosis, anemia, bleeding tendency, etc.), neuromuscular (spinocerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, etc.), and ophthalmological symptoms (e.g., retinitis pigmentosa). If left untreated, the disease can be debilitating and even lethal by the third decade of life due to the development of severe complications, such as blindness, neuromyopathy, and respiratory failure. High dose vitamin supplementation is the mainstay for treatment and may prevent, delay, or alleviate the complications and improve the prognosis, enabling some patients to live to the eighth decade of life. However, it cannot fully prevent or restore impaired function. Novel therapeutic modalities that improve quality of life and prognosis are awaited. The aim of this review is to 1) summarize the pathogenesis, clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and management of ABL, and 2) propose diagnostic criteria that define eligibility to receive financial support from the Japanese government for patients with ABL as a rare and intractable disease. In addition, our diagnostic criteria and the entry criterion of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ＜15 mg/dL and apoB ＜15 mg/dL can be useful in universal or opportunistic screening for the disease. Registry research on ABL is currently ongoing to better understand the disease burden and unmet needs of this life-threatening disease with few therapeutic options.",

To prevent cardiovascular disease and premature mortality, patients with the condition need to be identified and to start treatment early in life.

In particular, these new therapies are expected to improve outcomes for patients with severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or statin intolerance. For patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, lipoprotein apheresis is currently the most valuable therapy available, but new approaches might reduce the need for this effective yet invasive, time-consuming, and expensive treatment.",

      "title": "Best practice for LDL-cholesterol: when and how to calculate.",
      "abstract": "The lipid profile is important in the risk assessment for cardiovascular disease. The lipid profile includes total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL-C has traditionally been calculated using the Friedewald equation (invalid with TGs greater than 4.5 mmol/L and is based on the assumption that the ratio of TG to cholesterol in very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is 5 when measured in mg /dL). LDL-C can be quantified with a reference method, beta-quantification involving ultracentrifugation and this is unsuitable for routine use. Direct measurement of LDL-C was expected to provide a solution with high TGs. However, this has some challenges because of a lack of standardisation between the reagents and assays from different manufacturers as well as the additional costs. Furthermore, mild hypertriglyceridaemia also distorts direct LDL-C measurements. With the limitations of the Friedewald equation, alternatives have been derived. Newer equations include the Sampson-National Institutes of Health (NIH) equation 2 and the Martin-Hopkins equation. The Sampson-NIH2 equation was derived using beta-quantification in a population with high TG and multiple least squares regression to calculate VLDL-C, using TGs and non-HDL-C as independent variables. These data were used in a second equation to calculate LDL-C. The Sampson-NIH2 equation can be used with TGs up to 9 mmol/L. The Martin-Hopkins equation uses a 180 cell stratification of TG/non-HDL-C to determine the TG:VLDL-C ratio and can be used with TGs up to 4.5 mmol/L. Recently, an extended Martin-Hopkins equation has become available for TGs up to 9.04 mmol/L.This article discusses the best practice approach to calculating LDL-C based on the available evidence.",

In this chapter, a discussion will be presented on the current recommendations for the management of mild-moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (150-880mg/dL). The aim of the interventions used is to decrease the LDL-cholesterol (c-LDL) and control the HTG. This entails reducing apoprotein B (ApoB) levels, the number of remaining TG-rich lipoproteins (LRP), non-HDL-cholesterol (c-non-HDL), and increasing HDL-cholesterol (c-HDL). The management strategy includes healthy lifestyle recommendations, and subsequent use of lipid-lowering drugs, including statins, fibrates, n-3 fatty acids and PCSK9 inhibitors.",

      "title": "Cholesterol-ferroptosis nexus: Unveiling novel cancer therapeutic avenues.",
      "abstract": "Ferroptosis, a novel form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-mediated lipid peroxidation, holds immense potential in cancer therapeutics due to its role in tumor progression and resistance. This review predominantly explores the intricate relationship between ferroptosis and cholesterol metabolism pathways, mainly focusing on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This review highlights the therapeutic implications of targeting cholesterol metabolism pathways for cancer treatment by delving into the mechanisms underlying ferroptosis regulation. Strategies such as inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and suppressing squalene synthesis offer promising avenues for inducing ferroptosis in cancer cells. Moreover, insights into targeting the 7-dehydrocholesterol pathway provide novel perspectives on modulating ferroptosis susceptibility and managing ferroptosis-associated diseases. Understanding the interplay between ferroptosis and cholesterol metabolism pathways underscores the potential of lipid metabolism modulation as an innovative therapeutic approach in cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Extensive research has focused on cellular cholesterol and its regulation, primarily due to its crucial physiological roles and its association with numerous diseases resulting from dysregulated homeostasis. Consequently, investigating cholesterol metabolism and the network of regulating proteins remains an ongoing challenge for biomedical research seeking new molecular targets to manage aberrant cholesterol levels in pathologic conditions. There is evidence that Sigma-2/TMEM97 receptor regulates cholesterol metabolism. However, the mechanisms remain incompletely understood to date. Therefore, this study aimed to employ a pharmacological approach based on selective Sigma-2/TMEM97 agonists, rimcazole and siramesine, to uncover the contribution of this receptor to cholesterol homeostasis. Our results indicate that Sigma-2/TMEM97 activation modulates cholesterol uptake by altering key proteins involved in, leading to free cholesterol and neutral lipids accumulation. This sheds light on potential mechanisms implied, contributing a new piece to the intricate puzzle of cholesterol metabolism homeostasis.",

      "title": "Algae Food Products as a Healthcare Solution.",
      "abstract": "Diseases such as obesity; cardiovascular diseases such as high blood pressure, myocardial infarction and stroke; digestive diseases such as celiac disease; certain types of cancer and osteoporosis are related to food. On the other hand, as the world's population increases, the ability of the current food production system to produce food consistently is at risk. As a result, intensive agriculture has contributed to climate change and a major environmental impact. Research is, therefore, needed to find new sustainable food sources. One of the most promising sources of sustainable food raw materials is macroalgae. Algae are crucial to solving this nutritional deficiency because they are abundant in bioactive substances that have been shown to combat diseases such as hyperglycemia, diabetes, obesity, metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. Examples of these substances include polysaccharides such as alginate, fucoidan, agar and carrageenan; proteins such as phycobiliproteins; carotenoids such as β-carotene and fucoxanthin; phenolic compounds; vitamins and minerals. Seaweed is already considered a nutraceutical food since it has higher protein values than legumes and soy and is, therefore, becoming increasingly common. On the other hand, compounds such as polysaccharides extracted from seaweed are already used in the food industry as thickening agents and stabilizers to improve the quality of the final product and to extend its shelf life; they have also demonstrated antidiabetic effects. Among the other bioactive compounds present in macroalgae, phenolic compounds, pigments, carotenoids and fatty acids stand out due to their different bioactive properties, such as antidiabetics, antimicrobials and antioxidants, which are important in the treatment or control of diseases such as diabetes, cholesterol, hyperglycemia and cardiovascular diseases. That said, there have already been some studies in which macroalgae (red, green and brown) have been incorporated into certain foods, but studies on gluten-free products are still scarce, as only the potential use of macroalgae for this type of product is considered. Considering the aforementioned issues, this review aims to analyze how macroalgae can be incorporated into foods or used as a food supplement, as well as to describe the bioactive compounds they contain, which have beneficial properties for human health. In this way, the potential of macroalgae-based products in eminent diseases, such as celiac disease, or in more common diseases, such as diabetes and cholesterol complications, can be seen.",

      "abstract": "Tangier disease is a genetic disorder characterized by an absence or extremely low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C). It is caused by a dysfunctional mutation of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) gene, the mandatory gene for generation of HDL particles from cellular cholesterol and phospholipids, and it appears in an autosomal recessive hereditary profile. To date, 35 cases have been reported in Japan and 109 cases outside Japan. With dysfunctional mutations in both alleles (homozygotes or compound heterozygotes), the HDL-C level is mostly less than 5 mg/dL and there is 10 mg/dL or less of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), the major protein component of HDL. In patients with Tangier disease, major physical findings are orange-colored pharyngeal tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, corneal opacity, lymphadenopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. Although patients tend to have decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, premature coronary artery disease is frequently observed. No specific curative treatment is currently available, so early identification of patients and preventing atherosclerosis development are crucial. Management of risk factors other than low HDL-C is also important, such as LDL-C levels, hypertension and smoking. Additionally, treatment for glucose intolerance might be required because impaired insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells has occasionally been reported.",

      "abstract": "Over the past 40 years, there has been considerable research into the management and treatment of atherogenic lipid disorders. Although the majority of treatments and management strategies for cardiovascular disease (CVD) center around targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), there is mounting evidence for the residual CVD risk attributed to high triglyceride (TG) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) levels despite the presence of lowered LDL-C levels. Among the biological mechanisms for clearing TG-rich lipoproteins, the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) plays a key role in the trafficking and metabolism of lipoprotein particles in multiple tissues, but it is not ordinarily expressed in the liver. Since VLDLR is capable of binding and internalizing apoE-containing TG-rich lipoproteins as well as Lp(a), hepatic VLDLR expression has the potential for promoting clearance of these atherogenic particles from the circulation and managing the residual CVD risk not addressed by current lipid lowering therapies. This review provides an overview of VLDLR function and the potential for developing a genetic medicine based on liver-targeted VLDLR gene expression.",

      "abstract": "Indians have early onset atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and acquire the risk factors at a younger age, and hence we need to aggressively address the management of dyslipidemia in the young. Cholesterol levels early in life will influence the development of atherosclerosis. Young atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients (18-40 yrs) should receive lipid-lowering drugs to reduce LDL-C<55 mg. Due to the asymptomatic nature of dyslipidemia, early screening will enable the implementation of management strategies which will decrease future cardiovascular events. In this review, we will provide insights into identifying and managing dyslipidemia in the 18-40 years age group (young adults). It is suggested that early detection and more aggressive management of dyslipidemia in young adults with or without risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, tobacco and central obesity, might reduce the risk of CV events occurring later in life. Although lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment (dietary recommendations, exercise, tobacco cessation, weight reduction, etc.) but in certain young adults we suggest use of statins in low dose or non-statin drugs if they have associated risk factors, LDL-C >160 mg or a high coronary calcium score. Young adults who are carriers of FH gene should receive aggressive lifestyle modification and appropriate antilipidemic therapy.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, significant advancements have been made in understanding Alzheimer's disease from both neurobiological and clinical perspectives. Exploring the complex systems underlying AD has unveiled insights that could potentially revolutionize therapeutic approaches. Recent investigations have highlighted intricate interactions among genetic, molecular, and environmental factors in AD. Optimism arises from neurobiological advancements and diverse treatment options, potentially slowing or halting disease progression. Amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles crucially influence AD onset and progression. Emerging treatments involve diverse strategies, such as approaches targeting multiple pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction pathways. Clinical trials using humanized monoclonal antibodies, focusing on immunotherapies eliminating amyloid-beta, have shown promise. Nonpharmacological interventions such as light therapy, electrical stimulation, cognitive training, physical activity, and dietary changes have drawn attention for their potential to slow cognitive aging and enhance brain health. Precision medicine, which involves tailoring therapies to individual genetic and molecular profiles, has gained traction. Ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are expected to yield more effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "The immune and endocrine systems collectively control homeostasis in the body. The endocrine system ensures that values of essential factors and nutrients such as glucose, electrolytes and vitamins are maintained within threshold values. The immune system resolves local disruptions in tissue homeostasis, caused by pathogens or malfunctioning cells. The immediate goals of these two systems do not always align. The immune system benefits from optimal access to nutrients for itself and restriction of nutrient availability to all other organs to limit pathogen replication. The endocrine system aims to ensure optimal nutrient access for all organs, limited only by the nutrients stores that the body has available. The actual state of homeostatic parameters such as blood glucose levels represents a careful balance based on regulatory signals from the immune and endocrine systems. This state is not static but continuously adjusted in response to changes in the current metabolic needs of the body, the amount of resources it has available and the level of threats it encounters. This balance is maintained by the ability of the immune and endocrine systems to interact and co-regulate systemic metabolism. In context of metabolic disease, this system is disrupted, which impairs functionality of both systems. The failure of the endocrine system to retain levels of nutrients such as glucose within threshold values impairs functionality of the immune system. In addition, metabolic stress of organs in context of obesity is perceived by the immune system as a disruption in local homeostasis, which it tries to resolve by the excretion of factors which further disrupt normal metabolic control. In this chapter, we will discuss how the immune and endocrine systems interact under homeostatic conditions and during infection with a focus on blood glucose regulation. In addition, we will discuss how this system fails in the context of metabolic disease.",

      "abstract": "After birth, healthy neonates undergo a period of altered glucose metabolism, known as \"transitional hypoglycemia.\" During the first 0 to 4 hours of life, the mean plasma glucose concentration decreases to 57 mg/dL, then by 72 to 96 hours of life increases to 82 mg/dL, well within the normal adult range. Recent data suggest that transitional hypoglycemia is due to persistence of the fetal beta cell's lower threshold for insulin release, resulting in a transient hyperinsulinemic state. While hypoglycemia is an expected part of the transition to postnatal life, it makes the identification of infants with persistent hypoglycemia disorders challenging. Given the risk of neurologic injury from hypoglycemia, identifying these infants is critical. Hyperinsulinism is the most common cause of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and infants and carries a high risk of neurocognitive dysfunction given the severity of the hypoglycemia and the inability to generate ketones, a critical alternative cerebral fuel. Screening neonates at risk for persistent hypoglycemia disorders and completing evaluations prior to hospital discharge is essential to prevent delayed diagnoses and neurologic damage.",

      "abstract": "Euglycemic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening emergency that is characterized by euglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketonemia. It is a well-recognized adverse event in diabetic patients taking sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT-2 inhibitor). However, there is limited data on SGLT-2 inhibitor-related euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients. The mechanism behind SGLT-2 inhibitor-associated euglycemic ketoacidosis involves a general state of starvation or relative insulin deficiency, which exacerbates the mild baseline ketonemia caused by this class of medications while normoglycemia is maintained. The incidence of euglycemic ketoacidosis will likely increase with the increasing use of SGLT-2 inhibitors for various indications in addition to diabetes mellitus type 2, predominantly for congestive heart failure (CHF). Recognizing the signs and symptoms of this life-threatening condition is essential to treat it effectively. Our objective is to comprehensively revisit the pathophysiology of euglycemic ketoacidosis associated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and the risk factors for the condition, review the available data, and summarize the reported cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients on SGLT-2 inhibitors. Our literature search identified five articles with six cases of euglycemic ketoacidosis in non-diabetic patients who were on SGLT-2 inhibitors for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The common risk factor in five out of the six cases was decreased oral intake due to acute illness, fasting, or a perioperative state.",

When blood glucose levels are inadequately controlled or left untreated, the result is a variety of microvascular and macrovascular complications. To prevent these outcomes, many medications are available to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus and prevent disease progression. However, most of the medications available to date only target a few of the physiological defects caused by diabetes and may come with side effects that make adherence to the medication improbable. Imeglimin, a medication currently under investigation in the United States and approved in Japan, is a novel, first-in-its-class medication with a mechanism that is currently understood to target multiple pathways to provide glycemic control. This review aims to present and discuss the current clinical and scientific evidence pertaining to imeglimin.",

Blood glucose monitoring with noninvasive detection technology can not only avoid the pain of patients and eliminate the harm of some biological materials for measuring glucose in vivo but also improve the frequency of detection, so as to control blood glucose concentration more closely. Traditional blood glucose detection methods are invasive and have some limitations. In this study, the significance of noninvasive blood glucose testing was analyzed and was pointed out that noninvasive blood glucose testing can monitor the blood glucose concentration of patients and relieve the pain of patients. Then, this study analyzed the spectral detection methods of noninvasive blood glucose, including conservation of energy metabolism, near infrared spectroscopy, and other spectral detection methods. Finally, this study made a comprehensive analysis of the domestic and international clinical application of noninvasive glucose spectrum monitoring and summarized the clinical application status of noninvasive glucose spectrum monitoring.",

      "abstract": "A crucial measure of diabetes management is to monitor blood glucose, which often requires continuous blood collection, leading to economic burden and discomfort. Blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin A1c serve as traditional indicators of glucose monitoring. But now glycated albumin, fructosamine, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) have been gaining more attention. 1,5-AG is a chemically stable monosaccharide that exists in the human body. Its serum concentration remains stable when blood glucose levels are normal. However, it decreases when blood glucose exceeds the renal glucose threshold. Studies have shown that 1.5-AG reflects blood glucose changes in 1 to 2 weeks; therefore, decreased levels of serum 1,5-AG can serve as a clinical indicator of short-term blood glucose disturbances. Recent studies have shown that 1,5-AG can be used not only for the screening and managing of diabetes but also for predicting diabetes-related adverse events and islet β cell function in prediabetic patients. In addition, saliva 1,5-AG demonstrates potential value in the screening and diagnosis of diabetes. This review focuses on the biological characteristics, detection methods, and clinical application of 1,5-AG to promote understanding and applicable research of 1,5-AG in the future.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a serious condition with various neurological dysfunctions in newborns. Disruptions in glucose metabolism, including both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, are common in NE and can significantly impact outcomes. Hypoglycemia, defined as blood glucose below 45 mg/dL, is associated with increased mortality, neurodevelopmental disabilities, and brain lesions on MRI. Conversely, hyperglycemia, above 120 to 150 mg/dL, has also been linked to heightened mortality, hearing impairment, and multiorgan dysfunction. Both aberrant glucose states appear to worsen prognosis compared to normoglycemic infants. Therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of care for NE that provides neuroprotection by reducing metabolic demands and inflammation. Adjunct therapies like glucagon and continuous glucose monitoring show promise in managing dysglycemia and improving outcomes. Glucagon can enhance cerebral blood flow and glucose supply, while continuous glucose monitoring enables real-time monitoring and personalized interventions. Maintaining balanced blood sugar levels is critical in managing NE. Early detection and intervention of dysglycemia are crucial to improve outcomes in neonates with encephalopathy. Further research is needed to optimize glycemic management strategies and explore the potential benefits of interventions like glucagon therapy.",

The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the dose-response association between the TyG index and the incidence of hypertension. An extensive search was conducted through several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, until June 1, 2024. The TyG index was used as the exposure, and the incidence of hypertension was measured throughout the TyG index intervals. The effect estimates were presented as odds ratios (OR) in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. Adjusted OR were carried out from all included studies to eliminate the possibility of confounding factors being involved in the incidence of hypertension. A total of 108.936 participants (mean age: 48.2 years old, male: 47%, mean body mass index: 23.9 kg/m2) from 14 observational studies were included. The TyG index in the most eminent category was related to a higher risk of hypertension in both unadjusted (OR: 2.59, 95%CI: 2.03-3.31, ",

Renal glucose threshold (about 9 mmol/L) is a window of glucose leak from capillary to interstitial tissue. It is important to keep blood glucose level < 9 mmol/L, for reducing vascular sclerosis as well as organs hypoperfusion, meanwhile pay attention to preventing more dangerous hypoglycemia. Glucose, as the main energy substrate, should be daily supply and its metabolism should be monitored. We used to talk \"nutritional support\". Support is conform the physiological ability of host, but therapy is to coordinate and change pathophysiology. So, nutritional support is not equal to nutritional therapy. For critical ill patients, we need to emphasize \"nutritional therapy\", i.e, do not give nutritional treatment without metabolic monitoring, make up for deficiencies and avoid metabolites overloading, rational adjustment to protect and coordinate organs function.",

      "title": "Noninvasive blood glucose detection system based on dynamic spectrum and \"M+N″ theory.",
      "abstract": "Noninvasive detection of blood glucose is an urgent problem to be solved in the prevention, treatment and management of diabetes. However, in the system of noninvasive detection of blood glucose content by spectral method, due to individual differences, interference in the measurement system and the fact that the content of blood glucose is three orders of magnitude smaller than the most abundant component in blood, the spectral signal of blood glucose component is weak, and the problem has not been solved so far. Dynamic spectrum (DS) method can theoretically eliminate the influence of individual differences and changes in measurement conditions, and \"M + N″ theory comprehensively considers the internal and external factors of spectral quantitative analysis of complex solution components, and provides some strategies to suppress the errors caused by multiple factors in spectral quantitative analysis of complex solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a system for non-invasive quantitative analysis of human blood glucose based on DS and \"M + N″ theory. In this paper, feasible methods are used in each step of the system to effectively reduce the influence of noise and interference factors, so that the model has good prediction performance. The correlation coefficient and root mean square error of calibration set were 0.9539 and 0.3965 (mmol/L), respectively. The correlation coefficient and root mean square error of prediction set were 0.9542 and 0.7305 (mmol/L), respectively. The system of noninvasive quantitative analysis of blood glucose proposed in this paper is effective and feasible, which not only makes great progress in noninvasive detection of human blood glucose, but also has application value for realizing noninvasive real-time detection of human blood components.",

      "title": "Association between Life's Essential 8 and cataract among US adults.",
      "abstract": "Currently, a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) indicators and cataract risk is lacking. Life's Essential 8 (LE8) is the latest concept proposed by the American Heart Association to comprehensively reflect CVH status. LE8 includes four health behaviors (diet, physical activity, smoking, and sleep) and four health factors (blood lipid, blood sugar, blood pressure, and body mass index). This study tried to evaluate the association between LE8 and cataract using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2008, a continuous research program which aims to monitor and evaluate the health and nutrition status of the US population. A cross-sectional study of 2720 non-cataract participants and 602 cataract participants. All participants were assigned to the poor, intermediate, and ideal CVH status groups based on LE8 score. Weighted multiple logistic regression was used to investigate the correlation between the LE8 score and cataract, as well as the correlation between each of the eight subitems and cataract, with potential confounding variables being adjusted. Then, restricted cubic spline analysis was used to further explore whether there was a nonlinear relationship between LE8 score and cataract. The proportion of cataract participants was 14.1%, 18.2%, and 20.6% in the ideal, intermediate, and poor CVH groups, respectively (P < 0.05). LE8 score was inversely associated with cataract risk, with each 10-point increase in LE8 score associated with a 14% reduction in cataract risk [odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79-0.93, P < 0.01]. Among all the LE8 subitems, physical activity, sleep, and blood glucose were significantly associated with cataract risk (all P < 0.05). Better CVH, defined by a higher LE8 score, is associated with a lower cataract risk. Efforts to improve LE8 score (especially when it comes to physical activity, sleep, and blood glucose) may serve as a novel strategy to help reduce the risk of cataract.",

      "abstract": "Metformin (dimethyl-biguanide) can claim its origins in the use of Galega officinalis as a plant treatment for symptoms ascribed to diabetes. Since the first clinical use of metformin as a glucose-lowering agent in 1957, this medicine has emerged as a first-line pharmacological option to support lifestyle interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D). It acts through multiple cellular pathways, principally in the gut, liver and muscle, to counter insulin resistance and lower blood glucose without weight gain or risk of overt hypoglycaemia. Other effects include improvements in lipid metabolism, decreased inflammation and lower long-term cardiovascular risk. Metformin is conveniently combined with other diabetes medications, can be prescribed in prediabetes to reduce the risk of progression to T2D, and is used in some regions to assist glycaemic control in pregnancy. Consistent with its diversity of actions, established safety profile and cost-effectiveness, metformin is being assessed for further possible clinical applications. The use of metformin requires adequate renal function for drug elimination, and may cause initial gastrointestinal side effects, which can be moderated by taking with meals or using an extended-release formulation. Thus, metformin serves as a valuable therapeutic resource for use throughout the natural history of T2D.",

      "title": "Advances in diabetes technology within the digital diabetes ecosystem.",
      "abstract": "Ongoing innovations in glucose monitoring, insulin delivery, and telehealth technologies have created a digital diabetes ecosystem populated by connected tools and technologies that have been shown to improve clinical outcomes, lower costs, and reduce the burden of diabetes. Advances in connected continuous glucose monitoring devices, insulin pumps, and insulin pens have led to the development of automated insulin delivery systems that modulate insulin infusion based on sensor glucose data. Similar integrations of continuous glucose monitoring and connected blood glucose meter data into \"smart\" pens have lessened the guesswork of intensive insulin management for individuals who prefer traditional injection therapy. A growing number of health apps that can be accessed through smartphones and wearable devices provide information and advice that support individuals in adopting healthier lifestyles. The differences in features and functionality give users the ability to select the devices that best meet their unique requirements and preferences. This article reviews the most current digital diabetes technologies and discusses how the connectivity of these tools can create an overarching architecture of feedback mechanisms that monitor an individual's health status, motivate and enhance adherence to self-management, and provide advice and decision-support tools to clinicians as well as other members of the health care team to make living with diabetes more manageable.",

      "title": "The Management of Elevated Blood Pressure in the Acute Care Setting: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.",
      "abstract": "Over the past 3 decades, a substantial body of high-quality evidence has guided the diagnosis and management of elevated blood pressure (BP) in the outpatient setting. In contrast, there is a lack of comparable evidence for guiding the management of elevated BP in the acute care setting, resulting in significant practice variation. Throughout this scientific statement, we use the terms acute care and inpatient to refer to care received in the emergency department and after admission to the hospital. Elevated inpatient BP is common and can manifest either as asymptomatic or with signs of new or worsening target-organ damage, a condition referred to as hypertensive emergency. Hypertensive emergency involves acute target-organ damage and should be treated swiftly, usually with intravenous antihypertensive medications, in a closely monitored setting. However, the risk-benefit ratio of initiating or intensifying antihypertensive medications for asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP is less clear. Despite this ambiguity, clinicians prescribe oral or intravenous antihypertensive medications in approximately one-third of cases of asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP. Recent observational studies have suggested potential harms associated with treating asymptomatic elevated inpatient BP, which brings current practice into question. Despite the ubiquity of elevated inpatient BPs, few position papers, guidelines, or consensus statements have focused on improving BP management in the acute care setting. Therefore, this scientific statement aims to synthesize the available evidence, provide suggestions for best practice based on the available evidence, identify evidence-based gaps in managing elevated inpatient BP (asymptomatic and hypertensive emergency), and highlight areas requiring further research.",

      "abstract": "Arterial pressure monitoring and management are mainstays of haemodynamic therapy in patients having surgery. This article presents updated consensus statements and recommendations on perioperative arterial pressure management developed during the 11th POQI PeriOperative Quality Initiative (POQI) consensus conference held in London, UK, on June 4-6, 2023, which included a diverse group of international experts. Based on a modified Delphi approach, we recommend keeping intraoperative mean arterial pressure ≥60 mm Hg in at-risk patients. We further recommend increasing mean arterial pressure targets when venous or compartment pressures are elevated and treating hypotension based on presumed underlying causes. When intraoperative hypertension is treated, we recommend doing so carefully to avoid hypotension. Clinicians should consider continuous intraoperative arterial pressure monitoring as it can help reduce the severity and duration of hypotension compared to intermittent arterial pressure monitoring. Postoperative hypotension is often unrecognised and might be more important than intraoperative hypotension because it is often prolonged and untreated. Future research should focus on identifying patient-specific and organ-specific hypotension harm thresholds and optimal treatment strategies for intraoperative hypotension including choice of vasopressors. Research is also needed to guide monitoring and management strategies for recognising, preventing, and treating postoperative hypotension.",

The AP waveform is a complex physiological signal that is determined by interplay of left ventricular stroke volume, systemic vascular resistance, and vascular compliance. Numerous PWA algorithms are available to estimate CO, including Windkessel models, long time interval or multi-beat analysis, pulse power analysis, or the pressure recording analytical method. Invasive, minimally-invasive, and noninvasive PWA monitoring systems can be classified according to the method they use to calibrate estimated CO values in externally calibrated systems, internally calibrated systems, and uncalibrated systems.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is associated with more end-organ damage, cardiovascular events, and disability-adjusted life years lost in the United States compared with all other modifiable risk factors. Several guidelines and scientific statements now endorse the use of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) monitoring with ambulatory BP monitoring or home BP monitoring to confirm or exclude hypertension status based on office BP measurement. Current ambulatory or home BP monitoring devices have been reliant on the placement of a BP cuff, typically on the upper arm, to measure BP. There are numerous limitations to this approach. Cuff-based BP may not be well-tolerated for repeated measurements as is utilized with ambulatory BP monitoring. Furthermore, improper technique, including incorrect cuff placement or use of the wrong cuff size, may lead to erroneous readings, affecting diagnosis and management of hypertension. Compared with devices that utilize a cuff, cuffless BP devices may overcome challenges related to technique, tolerability, and overall utility in the outpatient setting. However, cuffless devices have several potential limitations that limit its routine use for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. The review discusses the different approaches for determining BP using various cuffless devices including engineering aspects of cuffless device technologies, validation protocols to test accuracy of cuffless devices, potential barriers to widespread implementation, and future areas of research. This review is intended for the clinicians who utilize out-of-office BP monitoring for the diagnosis and management of hypertension.",

      "abstract": "The method typically used to diagnose and monitor hypertensive patients has been to measure blood pressure in the physician's surgery; however, it is a well-known fact that this approach poses certain drawbacks, such as observer bias, failure to detect an alert reaction in the clinic, etc., difficulties that affect its accuracy as a diagnostic method. In recent years, the varying international scientific societies have persistently recommended the use of blood pressure measurements outside the clinic (at home or in the outpatient setting), using validated automatic devices. Data from some studies suggest that if we rely solely on in-office measurements, approximately 15-20% of the time we may be wrong when making decisions, both in terms of diagnosis and patient follow-up. Home blood pressure measurements are a simple and very affordable method that has a similar reproducibility and prognostic value as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, the availability of which is currently very limited. Moreover, ambulatory self-measurements have the significant benefit of being able to improve control of hypertensive individuals. Healthcare professionals and patients should be aware of the methodology of home blood pressure measurement, its usefulness and limitations.",

      "title": "History of blood pressure measurement in newborns and infants.",
      "abstract": "The development of methods for measuring blood pressure (BP) in newborns and small children has a rich history. Methods for BP measuring in adults had to be adapted to this age group. For measuring BP in direct invasive way, a suitable approach had to be found to access the arterial circulation through the umbilical and later radialis artery. Currently, results obtained from direct invasive BP measurement are considered the \"gold standard\". The development of non-invasive methods for BP measuring in newborns and children began with the use of von Basch's sphygmomanometer (1880). In 1899, Gustav Gärtner constructed the device, which was the basis for the flush method. After the discovery of the palpation and auscultation methods, these methods were also used for BP measurement in newborns and children, however, the BP values obtained in these ways were typically underestimated using excessively wide cuffs. From the auscultation method, methods utilizing ultrasound and infrasound to detect arterial wall movement and blood flow were later developed. The oscillometric method for BP measurement was introduced by E. J. Marey so early as in 1876. In 1912, P. Balard used the oscillometric technique to measure blood pressure in a large group of newborns. Through different types of oscillometers using various methods for detecting vascular oscillations (such as xylol method, impedance and volume plethysmography, etc.), the development has continued to assessment of vascular oscillations by modern sensor technology and software. For continuous non-invasive blood pressure measurement, the volume-clamp method, first described by Jan Peňáz in 1968, was developed. After modification for use in newborns, application of the cuff to the wrist instead of the finger, it is primarily used in clinical physiological studies to evaluate beat-to-beat BP and heart rate pressure variability, such as in the determination of the baroreflex sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Home blood pressure monitoring provides important diagnostic information beyond in-office blood pressure readings and offers similar results to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring involves patients independently measuring their blood pressure with an electronic device, whereas ambulatory blood pressure monitoring involves patients wearing a portable monitor for 24 to 48 hours. Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the diagnostic standard for measurement, home blood pressure monitoring is more practical and accessible to patients, and its use is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. Home blood pressure monitoring generally results in lower blood pressure readings than in-office measurements, can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension after an elevated office blood pressure reading, and can identify patients with white coat hypertension or masked hypertension. Best practices for home blood pressure monitoring include using an appropriately fitting upper-arm cuff on a bare arm, emptying the bladder, avoiding caffeinated beverages for 30 minutes before taking the measurement, resting for five minutes before taking the measurement, keeping the feet on the floor uncrossed and the arm supported with the cuff at heart level, and not talking during the reading. An average of multiple readings, ideally two readings in the morning and again in the evening separated by at least one minute each, is recommended for one week. Home blood pressure readings can be used in hypertension quality measures.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension diagnosis is one of the most common and important procedures in everyday clinical practice. Its applicability depends on correct and comparable measurements. Cuff-based measurement paradigms have dominated ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements for multiple decades. Cuffless and non-invasive methods may offer various advantages, such as a continuous and undisturbing measurement character. This review presents a conceptual overview of recent advances in the field of cuffless measurement paradigms and possible future developments which would enable cuffless beat-to-beat BP estimation paradigms to become clinically viable. It was refrained from a direct comparison between most studies and focussed on a conceptual merger of the ideas and conclusions presented in landmark scientific literature. There are two main approaches to cuffless beat-to-beat BP estimation represented in the scientific literature: First, models based on the physiological understanding of the cardiovascular system, mostly reliant on the pulse wave velocity combined with additional parameters. Second, models based on Deep Learning techniques, which have already shown great performance in various other medical fields. This review wants to present the advantages and limitations of each approach. Following this, the conceptional idea of unifying the benefits of physiological understanding and Deep Learning techniques for beat-to-beat BP estimation is presented. This could lead to a generalised and uniform solution for cuffless beat-to-beat BP estimations. This would not only make them an attractive clinical complement or even alternative to conventional cuff-based measurement paradigms but would substantially change how we think about BP as a fundamental marker of cardiovascular medicine.",

      "abstract": "The process by which cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains approximately constant in response to short-term variations in arterial blood pressure (ABP) is known as cerebral autoregulation. This classic view, that it remains constant over a wide range of ABP, has however been challenged by a growing number of studies. To provide an updated understanding of the static cerebral pressure-flow relationship and to characterise the autoregulation curve more rigorously, we conducted a comprehensive literature research. Results were based on 143 studies in healthy individuals aged 18 to 65 years. The mean sensitivities of CBF to changes in ABP were found to be 1.47 ± 0.71%/% for decreased ABP and 0.37 ± 0.38%/% for increased ABP. The significant difference in CBF directional sensitivity suggests that cerebral autoregulation appears to be more effective in buffering increases in ABP than decreases in ABP. Regression analysis of absolute CBF and ABP identified an autoregulatory plateau of approximately 20 mmHg (ABP between 80 and 100 mmHg), which is much smaller than the widely accepted classical view. Age and sex were found to have no effect on autoregulation strength. This data-driven approach provides a quantitative method of analysing static autoregulation that can be easily updated as more experimental data become available.",

      "abstract": "Automated cuff measured blood pressure (BP) is the global standard used for diagnosing hypertension, but there are concerns regarding the accuracy of the method. Individual variability in systolic BP (SBP) amplification from central (aorta) to peripheral (brachial) arteries could be related to the accuracy of cuff BP, but this has never been determined and was the aim of this study. Automated cuff BP and invasive brachial BP were recorded in 795 participants (74% male, aged 64 ± 11 years) receiving coronary angiography at five independent research sites (using seven different automated cuff BP devices). SBP amplification was recorded invasively by catheter and defined as brachial SBP minus aortic SBP. Compared with invasive brachial SBP, cuff SBP was significantly underestimated (130 ± 18 mmHg vs. 138 ± 22 mmHg, p < 0.001). The level of SBP amplification varied significantly among individuals (mean ± SD, 7.3 ± 9.1 mmHg) and was similar to level of difference between cuff and invasive brachial SBP (mean difference -7.6 ± 11.9 mmHg). SBP amplification explained most of the variance in accuracy of cuff SBP (R",

Many studies attest to the value of lifestyle adjustments and pharmacologic therapy in improving outcomes in patients with hypertension. Since blood pressure is a dynamic vitals sign, variability in visit-to-visit measurements is expected. While guidelines recommend a goal blood pressure, increasing attention is centered on how often a patient's blood pressure is found to be not only below the recommended goal value, but also how much of the time the blood pressure is below what is considered a safe lower goal threshold for blood pressure. In this Perspective we review a relatively new technique in addressing adequacy of blood pressure treatment, the time in therapeutic range, and provide examples supporting the clinical relevance of this novel metric.",

In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of wearable cardiovascular sensors, focusing particularly on those that measure blood pressure. We explore biosignal sensing principles, discuss blood pressure estimation methods (including machine learning algorithms) and summarize the latest advances in cuffless wearable blood pressure sensors.

      "abstract": "Arterial blood pressure is one of the most often measured vital parameters in clinical practice. State-of-the-art noninvasive ABP measurement technologies have noticeable limitations and are mainly based on uncomfortable techniques of complete or partial arterial occlusion by cuffs. Most commonplace devices provide only intermittent measurements, and continuous systems are bulky and difficult to apply correctly for nonprofessionals. Continuous cuffless ABP measurements are still an unmet clinical need and a topic of ongoing research, with only few commercially available devices. This paper discusses surrogate-based noninvasive blood pressure measurement techniques. It covers measurement methods of continuously and noninvasively inferring BP from surrogate signals without applying external pressures, except for reference or initialization purposes. The BP is estimated by processing signal features, so called surrogates, which are modulated by variations of BP. Discussed techniques include well-known approaches such as pulse transit time and pulse arrival time techniques, pulse wave analysis or combinations thereof. Despite a long research history, these methods have not found widespread use in clinical and ambulatory practice, in part due to technical limitations and the lack of a standardized regulatory framework. This work summarizes findings from an invited workshop of experts in the fields covering clinical expertise, engineering aspects, commercialization and standardization issues. The goal is to provide an application driven outlook, starting with clinical needs, and extending to technical actuality. It provides an outline of recommended research directions and includes a detailed overview of clinical use case scenarios for these technologies, opportunities, and limitations.",

      "abstract": "Accurate blood pressure (BP) assessment is essential for the optimal diagnosis and management of hypertension. Contemporary clinical practice guidelines strongly endorse use of automated cuff blood pressure measuring devices (BPMD) as the preferred means of measuring and monitoring BP in the office, at home and with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. To ensure that they are accurate, automated BPMDs should undergo clinical validation testing, performed using an established clinical validation standard. Unfortunately, most BPMDs sold on the global market have not been clinically validated. Furthermore, in the last thirty years, several different clinical validation protocols have been published, with major differences apparent between these standards, causing controversy with respect to which standard is considered acceptable for clinical validation. Complexly worded standards, multiple revisions, and firewalled access also contribute to a lack of understanding and use of clinical validation standards and the number of expert centers performing clinical validations is small. Recently, joint society collaborations have led to creation of the AAMI/ESH/ISO universal standard for the clinical validation of automated cuff BPMDs. Not only is this unified standard a necessary step, but oversight from regulators and influential stakeholders to ensure that only clinically validated BPMDs can be marketed is additionally needed.",

They may influence systolic blood pressure measurements and the accuracy of cardiac output monitoring with pulse wave analysis techniques. It is therefore recommended to regularly perform fast flush tests to unmask abnormal damping. Smart algorithms have recently been developed for the automatic detection of abnormal damping. In case of overdamping, air bubbles, kinking, and partial obstruction of the arterial catheter should be suspected and eliminated. In the case of underdamping, resonance filters may be necessary to normalize the arterial pressure waveform and ensure accurate hemodynamic measurements.",

However, for conscious individuals, traditional cuff-based BP monitoring devices are often uncomfortable, intermittent, and impractical for frequent measurements. Continuous and non-invasive BP (NIBP) monitoring is currently gaining attention in the human health monitoring area due to its promising potentials in assessing the health status of an individual, enabled by machine learning (ML), for various purposes such as early prediction of disease and intervention treatment. This review presents the development of a non-invasive BP measuring tool called sphygmomanometer in brief, summarizes state-of-the-art NIBP sensors, and identifies extended works on continuous NIBP monitoring using commercial devices. Moreover, the NIBP predictive techniques including pulse arrival time, pulse transit time, pulse wave velocity, and ML are elaborated on the basis of bio-signals acquisition from these sensors. Additionally, the different BP values (systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure) of the various ML models adopted in several reported studies are compared in terms of the international validation standards developed by the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) for clinically-approved BP monitors. Finally, several challenges and possible solutions for the implementation and realization of continuous NIBP technology are addressed.",

      "title": "Features from the photoplethysmogram and the electrocardiogram for estimating changes in blood pressure.",
      "abstract": "There is a growing emphasis being placed on the potential for cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation through modelling of morphological features from the photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). However, the appropriate features and models to use remain unclear. We investigated the best features available from the PPG and ECG for BP estimation using both linear and non-linear machine learning models. We conducted a clinical study in which changes in BP ([Formula: see text]BP) were induced by an infusion of phenylephrine in 30 healthy volunteers (53.8% female, 28.0 (9.0) years old). We extracted a large and diverse set of features from both the PPG and the ECG and assessed their individual importance for estimating [Formula: see text]BP through Shapley additive explanation values and a ranking coefficient. We trained, tuned, and evaluated linear (ordinary least squares, OLS) and non-linear (random forest, RF) machine learning models to estimate [Formula: see text]BP in a nested leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. We reported the results as correlation coefficient ([Formula: see text]), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The non-linear RF model significantly ([Formula: see text]) outperformed the linear OLS model using both the PPG and the ECG signals across all performance metrics. Estimating [Formula: see text]SBP using the PPG alone ([Formula: see text] = 0.86 (0.23), RMSE = 5.66 (4.76) mmHg, MAE = 4.86 (4.29) mmHg) performed significantly better than using the ECG alone ([Formula: see text] = 0.69 (0.45), RMSE = 6.79 (4.76) mmHg, MAE = 5.28 (4.57) mmHg), all [Formula: see text]. The highest ranking features from the PPG largely modelled increasing reflected wave interference driven by changes in arterial stiffness. This finding was supported by changes observed in the PPG waveform in response to the phenylephrine infusion. However, a large number of features were required for accurate BP estimation, highlighting the high complexity of the problem. We conclude that the PPG alone may be further explored as a potential single source, cuffless, blood pressure estimator. The use of the ECG alone is not justified. Non-linear models may perform better as they are able to incorporate interactions between feature values and demographics. However, demographics may not adequately account for the unique and individualised relationship between the extracted features and BP.",

      "abstract": "Wearable health monitoring is a multibillion-dollar industry. But the holy grail is probably getting it right for blood pressure monitoring without a cuff, because raised blood pressure is very common and the leading cause of death in the world. Many have tried and failed, but industry is persisting: numerous cuffless wearable blood pressure devices are on the market, several technologies have been developed, hundreds of patents are registered every year, and some devices already have regulatory approval. However, to convince the die-hard blood pressure critic is a different ball game. To understand the challenges of currently accepted methods and cuffless devices, I performed a 24-h blood pressure monitoring self-test, including measurements when awake, asleep and watching an intense match of the Rugby World Cup final, with the purpose to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities we face. Blood pressure was monitored using five different devices simultaneously: validated left and right arm cuff blood pressure, and three cuffless wearable devices (wrist-band, chest patch and a ring). Whilst none of these devices proved to be perfect in capturing a physiologically challenging measure, namely blood pressure, it emphasised that our current practice of a single blood pressure measurement in clinical practice should be revisited. It further begs the question of when cuffless measurements will be good enough to incorporate in clinical decision-making.",

      "abstract": "Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is a key haemodynamic variable monitored in critically ill patients. The advantages of oscillometric noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement are its easy and fast methodology; however, the accuracy and the precision of this measurement in critically ill patients is constantly debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies comparing oscillometric NIBP methods with invasive arterial pressure (IAP) measurements. We included studies of adult critically ill patients, which evaluated MAP in the same patient by both NIBP and IAP at any site. We included only studies comparing simultaneous measurements of arterial pressure by NIBP and IAP, reporting their results using mean difference and SD of agreement. The main outcome was to define the bias of the MAP measured by NIBP over the IAP measurement. The quality of the studies was analysed by the QUADAS 2 tool. Seven studies and 1593 patients were included in the main analysis. The oscillometric NIBP method had a mean value of -1.50 mmHg when compared with IAP (95% CI: -3.34 to 0.35; I2 = 96% for random effects model, P < 0.01). The limits of agreement for MAP varied between -14.6 mmHg and +40.3 mmHg. NIBP had an adequate accuracy regarding MAP measurements by oscillometry. Limits of agreement may thus narrow the clinical applicability in scenarios in which there is a need for a more precise management of blood pressure.",

      "title": "Provisional Decision-Making for Perioperative Blood Pressure Management: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is a basic determinant for organ blood flow supply. Insufficient blood supply will cause tissue hypoxia, provoke cellular oxidative stress, and to some extent lead to organ injury. Perioperative BP is labile and dynamic, and intraoperative hypotension is common. It is unclear whether there is a causal relationship between intraoperative hypotension and organ injury. However, hypotension surely compromises perfusion and causes harm to some extent. Because the harm threshold remains unknown, various guidelines for intraoperative BP management have been proposed. With the pending definitions from robust randomized trials, it is reasonable to consider observational analyses suggesting that mean arterial pressures below 65 mmHg sustained for more than 15 minutes are associated with myocardial and renal injury. Advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence may facilitate the management of hemodynamics globally, including fluid administration, rather than BP alone. The previous mounting studies concentrated on associations between BP targets and adverse complications, whereas few studies were concerned about how to treat and multiple factors for decision-making. Hence, in this narrative review, we discussed the way of BP measurement and current knowledge about baseline BP extracting for surgical patients, highlighted the decision-making process for BP management with a view to providing pragmatic guidance for BP treatment in the clinical settings, and evaluated the merits of an automated blood control system in predicting hypotension.",

Mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure during daytime, nighttime, diurnal index, pulse pressure, and heart rate were extracted from the ABPM recordings. VaD patients presented higher SBP values compared to AD patients and healthy controls. DBP values in the AD group were the lowest, while VaD patients presented the highest DBP values, including day and nighttime. Mean arterial pressure values were also the highest in the VaD group, while AD patients had similar values with the control group. The VaD patients presented the lowest systolic diurnal index compared to AD patients and controls. The mean pulse pressure and nighttime pulse pressure values were higher in both groups of dementia patients when compared with the control group. Increased SBP, pulse pressure, and alteration in the circadian pattern with the highest incidence of the non-dipper and reverse dipper patterns were found in patients with dementia when compared with the healthy elderly.

      "abstract": "Accurate estimation of blood pressure (BP) waveforms is critical for ensuring the safety and proper care of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and for intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring. Normal cuff-based BP measurements can only provide systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Alternatively, the BP waveform can be used to estimate a variety of other physiological parameters and provides additional information about the patient's health. As a result, various techniques are being proposed for accurately estimating the BP waveforms. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the BP waveform, three methodologies (pressure-based, ultrasound-based, and deep-learning-based) used in noninvasive BP waveform estimation research and the feasibility of employing these strategies at home as well as in ICUs. Additionally, this article will discuss the physical concepts underlying both invasive and noninvasive BP waveform measurements. We will review historical BP waveform measurements, standard clinical procedures, and more recent innovations in noninvasive BP waveform monitoring. Although the technique has not been validated, it is expected that precise, noninvasive BP waveform estimation will be available in the near future due to its enormous potential.",

      "title": "Central Over Peripheral Blood Pressure: An Emerging Issue in Hypertension Research.",
      "abstract": "Measurement of blood pressure is one of the most important and powerful clinical tools in clinical practice. Physicians use the classical method that was introduced more than 100 years ago with the emergence of the brachial cuff sphygmomanometer. The use of this method, despite its initial setbacks, spread like fire throughout the medical community with the boost by the early adoption by insurance companies to assess risk as well as the ease of use, the availability with the wide variety of devices, the good reproducibility and its predictive role. However, a long-forgotten dispute between measurements of peripheral (brachial) and central (aortic, carotid) blood pressure has resurfaced after the introduction of techniques and devices that can easily and accurately estimate non-invasively the central pressure waveform. Clinicians, until recently, focussed only on the pressure waveform trough (diastole) and peak (systole), ignoring the possible information provided by the rest of the arterial pressure waveform. Several restrictions exist with peripheral blood pressures measured with either an oscillometric or a sphygmomanometer device that blur the existing image of the ideal biomarker to describe the haemodynamic characteristics of the cardiovascular system. On the other hand, central pressures seem to be more pathophysiologically relevant to end-organ damage of the brain, heart and kidneys and on future events. Furthermore, measurement of the central waveform can provide clinically useful information, like the quantification of wave reflections with augmentation index, beyond blood pressure measured in the brachial artery. This article will explain the pathophysiological mechanisms linking central pressures to cardiovascular outcomes, review the evidence for the use of central blood pressure over peripheral pressures, elaborate on the prognostic role of central blood pressures and finally review the latest developments on the pharmacological modulation of central blood pressures.",

Radial artery cannulation for arterial blood pressure monitoring is a safe and effective procedure that can reasonably be performed in the prehospital setting by both physicians and nonphysicians.

      "title": "A Novel Clustering-Based Algorithm for Continuous and Noninvasive Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation.",
      "abstract": "Extensive research has been performed on continuous and noninvasive cuff-less blood pressure (BP) measurement using artificial intelligence algorithms. This approach involves extracting certain features from physiological signals, such as ECG, PPG, ICG, and BCG, as independent variables and extracting features from arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals as dependent variables and then using machine-learning algorithms to develop a blood pressure estimation model based on these data. The greatest challenge of this field is the insufficient accuracy of estimation models. This paper proposes a novel blood pressure estimation method with a clustering step for accuracy improvement. The proposed method involves extracting pulse transit time (PTT), PPG intensity ratio (PIR), and heart rate (HR) features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals as the inputs of clustering and regression, extracting systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) features from ABP signals as dependent variables, and finally developing regression models by applying gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), and multilayer perceptron regression (MLP) on each cluster. The method was implemented using the MIMIC-II data set with the silhouette criterion used to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results showed that because of the inconsistency, high dispersion, and multitrend behavior of the extracted features vectors, the accuracy can be significantly improved by running a clustering algorithm and then developing a regression model on each cluster and finally weighted averaging of the results based on the error of each cluster. When implemented with 5 clusters and GBR, this approach yielded an MAE of 2.56 for SBP estimates and 2.23 for DBP estimates, which were significantly better than the best results without clustering (DBP: 6.27, SBP: 6.36).",

      "abstract": "The critical functions of the human liver are coordinated through the interactions of hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells. Recent advances in single-cell transcriptional approaches have enabled an examination of the human liver with unprecedented resolution. However, dissociation-related cell perturbation can limit the ability to fully capture the human liver's parenchymal cell fraction, which limits the ability to comprehensively profile this organ. Here, we report the transcriptional landscape of 73,295 cells from the human liver using matched single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). The addition of snRNA-seq enabled the characterization of interzonal hepatocytes at a single-cell resolution, revealed the presence of rare subtypes of liver mesenchymal cells, and facilitated the detection of cholangiocyte progenitors that had only been observed during in vitro differentiation experiments. However, T and B lymphocytes and natural killer cells were only distinguishable using scRNA-seq, highlighting the importance of applying both technologies to obtain a complete map of tissue-resident cell types. We validated the distinct spatial distribution of the hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, and mesenchymal cell populations by an independent spatial transcriptomics data set and immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: Our study provides a systematic comparison of the transcriptomes captured by scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq and delivers a high-resolution map of the parenchymal cell populations in the healthy human liver.",

Behind each liver functional unit, termed lobules, hides a heterogeneous, complex, and well-orchestrated system. Despite parenchymal cells being most commonly associated with the liver's primary functionality, it has become clear that it is the immune niche of the liver that plays a central role in maintaining both local and systemic homeostasis by propagating hepatic inflammation and orchestrating its resolution. As such, the immunological processes that are at play in healthy and diseased livers are being investigated thoroughly in order to understand the underpinnings of inflammation and the potential avenues for restoring homeostasis. This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of the immune niche of the liver and provides perspectives for how the implementation of new transcriptomic, multimodal, and spatial technologies can uncover the heterogeneity, plasticity, and location of hepatic immune populations. Findings from these technologies will further our understanding of liver biology and create a new framework for the identification of therapeutic targets.",

      "abstract": "The postnatal development and maturation of the liver, the major metabolic organ, are inadequately understood. We have analyzed 52,834 single-cell transcriptomes and identified 31 cell types or states in mouse livers at postnatal days 1, 3, 7, 21, and 56. We observe unexpectedly high levels of hepatocyte heterogeneity in the developing liver and the progressive construction of the zonated metabolic functions from pericentral to periportal hepatocytes, which is orchestrated with the development of sinusoid endothelial, stellate, and Kupffer cells. Trajectory and gene regulatory analyses capture 36 transcription factors, including a circadian regulator, Bhlhe40, in programming liver development. Remarkably, we identified a special group of macrophages enriched at day 7 with a hybrid phenotype of macrophages and endothelial cells, which may regulate sinusoidal construction and Treg-cell function. This study provides a comprehensive atlas that covers all hepatic cell types and is instrumental for further dissection of liver development, metabolism, and disease.",

      "abstract": "The metabolic, digestive and homeostatic roles of the liver are dependent on proper crosstalk and organization of hepatic cell lineages. These hepatic cell lineages are derived from their respective progenitors early in organogenesis in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, contributing to the liver's specialized and diverse microarchitecture. Advances in genomics, lineage tracing and microscopy have led to seminal discoveries in the past decade that have elucidated liver cell lineage hierarchies. In particular, single-cell genomics has enabled researchers to explore diversity within the liver, especially early in development when the application of bulk genomics was previously constrained due to the organ's small scale, resulting in low cell numbers. These discoveries have substantially advanced our understanding of cell differentiation trajectories, cell fate decisions, cell lineage plasticity and the signalling microenvironment underlying the formation of the liver. In addition, they have provided insights into the pathogenesis of liver disease and cancer, in which developmental processes participate in disease emergence and regeneration. Future work will focus on the translation of this knowledge to optimize in vitro models of liver development and fine-tune regenerative medicine strategies to treat liver disease. In this Review, we discuss the emergence of hepatic parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells, advances that have been made in in vitro modelling of liver development and draw parallels between developmental and pathological processes.",

Although the importance of the hepatic nervous system in maintaining and restoring liver homeostasis is increasingly appreciated, much remains unknown about the specific mechanisms by which hepatic nerves both influence and are influenced by liver diseases. While recent work has begun to illuminate the developmental mechanisms underlying recruitment of nerves to the liver, evolutionary differences contributing to species-specific patterns of hepatic innervation remain elusive. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the development of the hepatic nervous system and its role in liver regeneration and disease. We also highlight areas in which further investigation would greatly enhance our understanding of the evolution and function of liver innervation.",

      "abstract": "The liver is a vital metabolism and detoxification organ of human body, which is involved in the biotransformation and metabolism of the organism. Hepatitis - cirrhosis - liver cancer are significant and common part of liver diseases. The pathogenesis of liver diseases is generally as followed: inflammation and other pathogenic factors cause persistent damage to the liver, leading to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Patients with chronic hepatitis have a high risk of developing into liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and even life-threatening liver cancer, which poses a great threat to public health.As the first organ to come into contact with blood from the gut, the liver is profoundly affected by the intestinal flora and its metabolites, with leaky gut and flora imbalance being the triggers of the liver's pathological response. So far, no one has reviewed the role of intestinal flora in this process from the perspective of the progression of hepatitis-cirrhosis-liver cancer and this article reviews the evidence supporting the effect of intestinal flora in the progression of liver disease.",

We analyzed hepatocyte transcriptomes of healthy young and aged male mice to generate an aging hepatocyte gene signature, used it to deconvolute transcriptomic data from humans and mice with metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease, validated findings with functional studies in mice and applied the signature to transcriptomic data from other organs to determine whether aging-sensitive degenerative mechanisms are conserved. We discovered that the signature enriches in diseased livers in parallel with degeneration. It is also enriched in failing human hearts, diseased kidneys and pancreatic islets from individuals with diabetes. The signature includes genes that control ferroptosis. Aged mice develop more hepatocyte ferroptosis and liver degeneration than young mice when fed diets that induce metabolic stress. Inhibiting ferroptosis shifts the liver transcriptome of old mice toward that of young mice and reverses aging-exacerbated liver damage, identifying ferroptosis as a tractable, conserved mechanism for aging-related tissue degeneration.",

Disruption of the circadian system, as occurs during jetlag, shift work or an unhealthy lifestyle, is implicated in several liver-related pathologies, ranging from metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to liver malignancies such as hepatocellular carcinoma. In this Review, we cover the molecular, cellular and organismal aspects of various liver pathologies from a circadian viewpoint, and in particular how circadian dysregulation has a role in the development and progression of these diseases. Finally, we discuss therapeutic and lifestyle interventions that carry health benefits through support of a functional circadian clock that acts in synchrony with the environment.",

This review delves into the cellular circuits that regulate adaptive immune responses in the liver, with a specific focus on hepatitis B virus infection as an illustrative example. A key aspect highlighted is the liver's specialized role in priming CD8+ T cells, leading to a distinct state of immune hyporesponsiveness. Additionally, the influence of the liver's hemodynamics and anatomical features, particularly during liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, on the differentiation and function of adaptive immune cells is discussed. While the primary emphasis is on CD8+ T cells, recent findings regarding the involvement of B cells and CD4+ T cells in hepatic immunity are also reviewed. Furthermore, we address the challenges ahead and propose integrating cutting-edge techniques, such as spatial biology, and combining mouse models with human sample analyses to gain comprehensive insights into the liver's adaptive immunity. This understanding could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting infectious diseases, malignancies, and inflammatory liver conditions like metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis.",

Ethanol is a major microbial metabolite that is produced in the intestine of nearly all individuals; however, elevated ethanol production is associated with pathological conditions such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and auto-brewery syndrome, in which the liver's capacity to metabolize ethanol is surpassed. In this Review, we describe the mechanisms underlying excessive ethanol production in the gut and the role of ethanol catabolism in mediating pathogenic effects of ethanol on the liver and host metabolism.

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is among the most widespread metabolic disease globally, and its associated complications including insulin resistance and diabetes have become threatening conditions for human health. Previous studies on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were focused on the liver's lipid metabolism. However, growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial metabolism is involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD to varying degrees in several ways, for instance in cellular division, oxidative stress, autophagy, and mitochondrial quality control. Ultimately, liver function gradually declines as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction. The liver is unable to transfer the excess lipid droplets outside the liver. Therefore, how to regulate hepatic mitochondrial function to treat NAFLD has become the focus of current research. This review provides details about the intrinsic link of NAFLD with mitochondrial metabolism and the mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunctions contribute to NAFLD progression. Given the crucial role of mitochondrial metabolism in NAFLD progression, the application potential of multiple mitochondrial function improvement modalities (including physical exercise, diabetic medications, small molecule agonists targeting Sirt3, and mitochondria-specific antioxidants) in the treatment of NAFLD was evaluated hoping to provide new insights into NAFLD treatment.",

      "abstract": "The human adult liver has a multi-cellular structure consisting of large lobes subdivided into lobules containing portal triads and hepatic cords lined by specialized blood vessels. Vital hepatic functions include filtering blood, metabolizing drugs, and production of bile and blood plasma proteins like albumin, among many other functions, which are generally dependent on the location or zone in which the hepatocyte resides in the liver. Due to the liver's intricate structure, there are many challenges to design differentiation protocols to generate more mature functional hepatocytes from human stem cells and maintain the long-term viability and functionality of primary hepatocytes. To this end, recent advancements in three-dimensional (3D) stem cell culture have accelerated the generation of a human miniature liver system, also known as liver organoids, with polarized epithelial cells, supportive cell types and extra-cellular matrix deposition by translating knowledge gained in studies of animal organogenesis and regeneration. To facilitate the efforts to study human development and disease using in vitro hepatic models, a thorough understanding of state-of-art protocols and underlying rationales is essential. Here, we review rapidly evolving 3D liver models, mainly focusing on organoid models differentiated from human cells.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unveils the enhanced proliferative, anti-apoptotic properties and repair potential of MoKCs compared with EmKCs, which are confirmed in vivo and ex vivo through flow cytometry, qPCR, Cell Counting Kit-8, and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, compared with EmKC-dominated livers, MoKC-dominated livers exhibit less functional damage, necrosis, and fibrosis under damage, as tested by serum alanine aminotransferase activity detection, H&E and Sirius red staining, qPCR, and western blot. Collectively, we highlight that MoKCs dominate the KC pool in injured livers and show enhanced proliferative and anti-apoptotic properties while also promoting repair and attenuating fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. However, how the role of peripheral organ changes in response to environmental stimuli during aging in AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) activity increases with age. Hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally attenuates brain amyloid-β (Aβ) burden, tauopathy, and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. Moreover, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma level of 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (-EET), which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier and modulates brain Aβ metabolism through multiple pathways. A balance between the brain levels of 14,15-EET and Aβ is essential for preventing Aβ deposition. In AD models, 14,15-EET infusion mimicked the neuroprotective effects of hepatic sEH ablation at biological and behavioral levels. These results highlight the liver's key role in AD pathology, and targeting the liver-brain axis in response to environmental stimuli may constitute a promising therapeutic approach for AD prevention.",

How the liver balances dual demands for increased proliferative activity with maintenance of organ function is unknown but essential to prevent liver failure. Using partial hepatectomy (PHx) in mice to model liver regeneration, we integrated single-cell RNA- and ATAC-Seq to map state transitions in approximately 13,000 hepatocytes at single-cell resolution as livers regenerated, and validated key findings with IHC, to uncover how the organ regenerates hepatocytes while simultaneously fulfilling its vital tissue-specific functions. After PHx, hepatocytes rapidly and transiently diversified into multiple distinct populations with distinct functional bifurcation: some retained the chromatin landscapes and transcriptomes of hepatocytes in undamaged adult livers, whereas others transitioned to acquire chromatin landscapes and transcriptomes of fetal hepatocytes. Injury-related signaling pathways known to be critical for regeneration were activated in transitioning hepatocytes, and the most fetal-like hepatocytes exhibited chromatin landscapes that were enriched with transcription factors regulated by those pathways.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is hallmarked by hepatic steatosis, cell injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. This study elaborates on a multicellular biochip-based liver sinusoid model to mimic MASLD pathomechanisms and investigate the therapeutic effects of drug candidates lanifibranor and resmetirom. Mouse liver primary hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells are seeded in a dual-chamber biocompatible liver-on-a-chip (LoC). The LoC is then perfused with circulating immune cells (CICs). Acetaminophen (APAP) and free fatty acids (FFAs) treatment recapitulate acute drug-induced liver injury and MASLD, respectively. As a benchmark for the LoC, multiplex immunofluorescence on livers from APAP-injected and dietary MASLD-induced mice reveals characteristic changes on parenchymal and immune cell populations. APAP exposure induces cell death in the LoC, and increased inflammatory cytokine levels in the circulating perfusate. Under FFA stimulation, lipid accumulation, cellular damage, inflammatory secretome, and fibrogenesis are increased in the LoC, reflecting MASLD. Both injury conditions potentiate CIC migration from the perfusate to the LoC cellular layers. Lanifibranor prevents the onset of inflammation, while resmetirom decreases lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and increases the generation of FFA metabolites in the LoC. This study demonstrates the LoC potential for functional and molecular evaluation of liver disease drug candidates.",

      "abstract": "The development of in vitro models that recapitulate critical liver functions is essential for accurate assessments of drug toxicity. Although liver organoids can be used for drug discovery and toxicology, they are limited by (i) the lack of expression and activity of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, and (ii) the difficulty of mimicking non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD, which influences the expression of these enzymes) in vitro. Here, we generated three-dimensional multi-cell-type liver organoids (hereafter \"HML organoids\") from HepaRG cells, primary human macrophages, and hepatic-stellate-cell-derived LX-2 cells. We also developed an NAFLD model by culturing HML organoids for 9 days with a mixture of stearic and oleic acids. The exposed organoids showed typical features of steatosis and expressed fibrosis markers. We subsequently used HML and NAFLD-HML organoids to model drug-induced liver injury. By estimating the IC50 and benchmark doses, we were able to improve the in vitro detection of drugs likely to be toxic in fatty livers. Thus, HML and NAFLD-HML organoids exhibited most of the liver's functions and are relevant in vitro models of drug metabolism, drug toxicity, and adverse drug event in NAFLD.",

In the liver's structure, we distinguish between connective tissue (stroma) and parenchyma, the latter of which is formed from the basic structural and functional units of the liver-hepatocytes. There are many factors, that negatively affect the liver cells, contributing to their damage. This may lead to fibrosis, liver failure and, in consequence, primary liver cancer, which is the sixth most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Chemokines are a large family of secreted proteins. Their main role is to direct the recruitment and migration of cells to sites of inflammation or injury. Some authors suggest that these proteins might play a potential role in the development of many malignancies, including primary liver cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate and summarize the knowledge regarding liver diseases, especially primary liver cancer (HCC) and the participation of chemokines in the development of this malignancy. Chemokines involved in the initiation of this type of tumor belong mainly to the CC and CXC chemokines. Their significant role in the course of hepatocellular carcinoma proves their usefulness in detecting and monitoring the course and treatment in patients with this disease.",

      "abstract": "As one of the most metabolically complex systems in the body, the liver ensures multi-organ homeostasis and ultimately sustains life. Nevertheless, during early postnatal development, the liver is highly immature and takes about 2 years to acquire and develop almost all of its functions. Different events occurring at the environmental and cellular levels are thought to mediate hepatic maturation and function postnatally. The crosstalk between the liver, the gut and its microbiome has been well appreciated in the context of liver disease, but recent evidence suggests that the latter could also be critical for hepatic function under physiological conditions. The gut-liver crosstalk is thought to be mediated by a rich repertoire of microbial metabolites that can participate in a myriad of biological processes in hepatic sinusoids, from energy metabolism to tissue regeneration. Studies on germ-free animals have revealed the gut microbiome as a critical contributor in early hepatic programming, and this influence extends throughout life, mediating liver function and body homeostasis. In this seminar, we describe the microbial molecules that have a known effect on the liver and discuss how the gut microbiome and the liver evolve throughout life. We also provide insights on current and future strategies to target the gut microbiome in the context of hepatology research.",

      "abstract": "The liver is uniquely bestowed with an ability to regenerate following a surgical or toxicant insult. One of the most researched models to demonstrate the regenerative potential of this organ is the partial hepatectomy model, where two thirds of the liver is surgically resected. The remnant liver replenishes the lost mass within 1014 days in mice. The distinctive ability of the liver to regenerate has allowed living donor and split liver transplantation. One signaling pathway shown to be activated during the process of regeneration to contribute toward the mass and functional recovery of the liver is the Wnt/-catenin pathway. Very early after any insult to the liver, the cellmolecule circuitry of the Wnt/-catenin pathway is set into motion with the release of specific Wnt ligands from sinusoidal endothelial cells and macrophages, which, in a paracrine manner, engage Frizzled and LDL-related protein-5/6 coreceptors on hepatocytes to stabilize -catenin inducing its nuclear translocation. Nuclear -catenin interacts with T-cell factor family of transcription factors to induce target genes including cyclin D1 for proliferation, and others for regulating hepatocyte function. Working in collaboration with other signaling pathways, Wnt/-catenin signaling contributes to the restoration process without any compromise of function at any stage. Also, stimulation of this pathway through innovative means induces liver regeneration when this process is exhausted or compromised and thus has applications in the treatment of end-stage liver disease and in the field of liver transplantation. Thus, Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway is highly relevant in the discipline of hepatic regenerative medicine.",

      "title": "Gut-liver-axis: Barrier function of liver sinusoidal endothelial cell.",
      "abstract": "Liver diseases are associated with the leaky gut via the gut-liver-axis. Previous studies have paid much attention to the effect of gut barrier damage. Notably, clinical observations and basic research reveal that the gut barrier damage seldom leads to liver injury independently but aggravates pre-existing liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and drug-induced liver injury. These evidences suggest that there is a hepatic barrier in the gut-liver-axis, protecting the liver against gut-derived pathogenic factors. However, it has never been investigated which type of liver cell plays the role of hepatic barrier. Under physiological conditions, liver sinusoidal endothelial cell (LSEC) can take up and eliminate virus, bacteriophage, microbial products, and metabolic wastes. LSEC also keeps the homeostasis of liver immune environment via tolerance-inducing and anti-inflammatory functions. In contrast, under pathological conditions, the clearance function of LSEC is impaired, and LSEC turns into a pro-inflammatory pattern. Given its anatomical position and physiological functions, LSEC is proposed as the hepatic barrier in the gut-liver-axis. In this review, we aim to further understand the role of LSEC as the hepatic barrier. Future studies are warranted to seek effective treatments to improve LSEC health, which appears to be a promising approach to prevent gut-derived liver injury.",

Recent studies have focused on the biological functions of isthmin in growth and development, angiogenesis, and metabolism. Distinct spatiotemporal expression of isthmin-1 (ISM-1) was observed during growth and development. ISM-1 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cancer by regulating cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and immune microenvironments. Moreover, ISM-1, as a newly identified insulin-like adipokine, increases adipocyte glucose uptake and inhibits hepatic lipid synthesis. However, the biological function of ISM-1 remains largely unknown. In this review, we highlight the structure and physiological functions of isthmin and explore its application potential, contributing to a better understanding of its function and providing prevention and treatment strategies for various diseases.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disorder. Increased sympathetic (noradrenergic) nerve tone has a complex role in the etiopathomechanism of NAFLD, affecting the development/progression of steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and liver hemodynamical alterations. Also, lipid sensing by vagal afferent fibers is an important player in the development of hepatic steatosis. Moreover, disorganization and progressive degeneration of liver sympathetic nerves were recently described in human and experimental NAFLD. These structural alterations likely come along with impaired liver sympathetic nerve functionality and lack of adequate hepatic noradrenergic signaling. Here, we first overview the anatomy and physiology of liver nerves. Then, we discuss the nerve impairments in NAFLD and their pathophysiological consequences in hepatic metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and hemodynamics. We conclude that further studies considering the spatial-temporal dynamics of structural and functional changes in the hepatic nervous system may lead to more targeted pharmacotherapeutic advances in NAFLD.",

      "abstract": "The liver emerges from the ventral foregut endoderm around 3 weeks in human and 1 week in mice after fertilization. The fetal liver works as a hematopoietic organ and then develops functions required for performing various metabolic reactions in late fetal and neonatal periods. In parallel with functional differentiation, the liver establishes three dimensional tissue structures. In particular, establishment of the bile excretion system consisting of bile canaliculi of hepatocytes and bile ducts of cholangiocytes is critical to maintain healthy tissue status. This is because hepatocytes produce bile as they functionally mature, and if allowed to remain within the liver tissue can lead to cytotoxicity. In this review, we focus on epithelial tissue morphogenesis in the perinatal period and cholestatic liver diseases caused by abnormal development of the biliary system.",

      "title": "\"Small Hepatocytes\" in the Liver.",
      "abstract": "Mature hepatocytes (MHs) in an adult rodent liver are categorized into the following three subpopulations based on their proliferative capability: type I cells (MH-I), which are committed progenitor cells that possess a high growth capability and basal hepatocytic functions; type II cells (MH-II), which possess a limited proliferative capability; and type III cells (MH-III), which lose the ability to divide (replicative senescence) and reach the final differentiated state. These subpopulations may explain the liver's development and growth after birth. Generally, small-sized hepatocytes emerge in mammal livers. The cells are characterized by being morphologically identical to hepatocytes except for their size, which is substantially smaller than that of ordinary MHs. We initially discovered small hepatocytes (SHs) in the primary culture of rat hepatocytes. We believe that SHs are derived from MH-I and play a role as hepatocytic progenitors to supply MHs. The population of MH-I (SHs) is distributed in the whole lobules, a part of which possesses a self-renewal capability, and decreases with age. Conversely, injured livers of experimental models and clinical cases showed the emergence of SHs. Studies demonstrate the involvement of SHs in liver regeneration. SHs that appeared in the injured livers are not a pure population but a mixture of two distinct origins, MH-derived and hepatic-stem-cell-derived cells. The predominant cell-derived SHs depend on the proliferative capability of the remaining MHs after the injury. This review will focus on the SHs that appeared in the liver and discuss the significance of SHs in liver regeneration.",

      "abstract": "In the liver, mitochondria are exposed to different concentrations of nutrients due to their spatial positioning across the periportal and pericentral axis. How the mitochondria sense and integrate these signals to respond and maintain homeostasis is not known. Here, we combine intravital microscopy, spatial proteomics, and functional assessment to investigate mitochondrial heterogeneity in the context of liver zonation. We find that periportal and pericentral mitochondria are morphologically and functionally distinct; beta-oxidation is elevated in periportal regions, while lipid synthesis is predominant in the pericentral mitochondria. In addition, comparative phosphoproteomics reveals spatially distinct patterns of mitochondrial composition and potential regulation via phosphorylation. Acute pharmacological modulation of nutrient sensing through AMPK and mTOR shifts mitochondrial phenotypes in the periportal and pericentral regions, linking nutrient gradients across the lobule and mitochondrial heterogeneity. This study highlights the role of protein phosphorylation in mitochondrial structure, function, and overall homeostasis in hepatic metabolic zonation. These findings have important implications for liver physiology and disease.",

These data suggest a mechanism for increased liver metastasis in breast cancer patients with recent childbirth. It is unknown whether the human liver changes in size and function during pregnancy and weaning. In this study, abdominal imaging was obtained in healthy women at early and late pregnancy and postwean. During pregnancy time points, glucose production and utilization and circulating bile acids were measured. Independently of weight gain, most women's livers increased in size with pregnancy, then returned to baseline postwean. Putative roles for bile acids in liver growth and regression were observed. Together, the data support the hypothesis that the human liver is regulated by reproductive state with growth during pregnancy and volume loss postwean. These findings have implications for sex-specific liver diseases and for breast cancer outcomes.",

      "title": "Delaying liver aging: Analysis of structural and functional alterations.",
      "abstract": "This article is based on a recent bibliometric analysis of research progress on liver aging. The liver is notable for its extraordinary ability to rejuvenate, thereby safeguarding and maintaining the organism's integrity. With advancing age, there is a noteworthy reduction in both the liver's size and blood circulation. Furthermore, the wide range of physiological alterations driven on by aging may foster the development of illnesses. Previous studies indicate that liver aging is linked to impaired lipid metabolism and abnormal gene expression associated with chronic inflammation. Factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction and telomere shortening accumulate, which may result in increased hepatic steatosis, which impacts liver regeneration, metabolism, and other functions. Knowing the structural and functional changes could help elderly adults delay liver aging. Increasing public awareness of anti-aging interventions is essential. Besides the use of dietary supplements, alterations in lifestyle, including changes in dietary habits and physical exercise routines, are the most efficacious means to decelerate the aging process of the liver. This article highlights recent advances in the mechanism research of liver aging and summarizes the promising intervention options to delay liver aging for preventing related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Porcine models of liver ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) are increasingly being used in transplant research. Contrary to rodents, porcine livers are anatomically and physiologically close to humans, with similar organ size and bile composition. NMP preserves the liver graft at near-to-physiological conditions by recirculating a warm, oxygenated, and nutrient-enriched red blood cell-based perfusate through the liver vasculature. NMP can be used to study ischemia-reperfusion injury, preserve a liver ex situ before transplantation, assess the liver's function prior to implantation, and provide a platform for organ repair and regeneration. Alternatively, NMP with a whole blood-based perfusate can be used to mimic transplantation. Nevertheless, this model is labor-intensive, technically challenging, and carries a high financial cost. In this porcine NMP model, we use warm ischemic damaged livers (corresponding to donation after circulatory death). First, general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation is initiated, followed by the induction of warm ischemia by clamping the thoracic aorta for 60 min. Cannulas inserted in the abdominal aorta and portal vein allow flush-out of the liver with cold preservation solution. The flushed-out blood is washed with a cell saver to obtain concentrated red blood cells. Following hepatectomy, cannulas are inserted in the portal vein, hepatic artery, and infra-hepatic vena cava and connected to a closed perfusion circuit primed with a plasma expander and red blood cells. A hollow fiber oxygenator is included in the circuit and coupled to a heat exchanger to maintain a pO2 of 70-100 mmHg at 38 °C. NMP is achieved by a continuous flow directly through the artery and via a venous reservoir through the portal vein. Flows, pressures, and blood gas values are continuously monitored. To evaluate the liver injury, perfusate and tissue are sampled at predefined time points; bile is collected via a cannula in the common bile duct.",

      "abstract": "Liver diseases are a significant global health issue, characterized by elevated levels of disorder and death. The substantial impact of ageing on liver diseases and their prognosis is evident. Multiple processes are involved in the ageing process, which ultimately leads to functional deterioration of this organ. The process of liver ageing not only renders the liver more susceptible to diseases but also compromises the integrity of other organs due to the liver's critical function in metabolism regulation. A growing body of research suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a significant role in the majority of pathophysiological pathways. They regulate gene expression through a variety of interactions with microRNAs (miRNAs), messenger RNAs (mRNAs), DNA, or proteins. LncRNAs exert a major influence on the progression of age-related liver diseases through the regulation of cell proliferation, necrosis, apoptosis, senescence, and metabolic reprogramming. A concise overview of the current understanding of lncRNAs and their potential impact on the development of age-related liver diseases will be provided in this mini-review.",

      "abstract": "The liver has a complex cellular composition and a remarkable regenerative capacity. The primary cell types in the liver are two parenchymal cell populations, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, that perform most of the functions of the liver and that are helped through interactions with non-parenchymal cell types comprising stellate cells, endothelia and various hemopoietic cell populations. The regulation of the cells in the liver is mediated by an insoluble complex of proteins and carbohydrates, the extracellular matrix, working synergistically with soluble paracrine and systemic signals. In recent years, with the rapid development of genetic sequencing technologies, research on the liver's cellular composition and its regulatory mechanisms during various conditions has been extensively explored. Meanwhile breakthroughs in strategies for cell transplantation are enabling a future in which there can be a rescue of patients with end-stage liver diseases, offering potential solutions to the chronic shortage of livers and alternatives to liver transplantation. This review will focus on the cellular mechanisms of liver homeostasis and how to select ideal sources of cells to be transplanted to achieve liver regeneration and repair. Recent advances are summarized for promoting the treatment of end-stage liver diseases by forms of cell transplantation that now include grafting strategies.",

      "abstract": "Owing to renal reabsorption and the loss of uricase activity, uric acid (UA) is strictly maintained at a higher physiological level in humans than in other mammals, which provides a survival advantage during evolution but increases susceptibility to certain diseases such as gout. Although monosodium urate (MSU) crystal precipitation has been detected in different tissues of patients as a trigger for disease, the pathological role of soluble UA remains controversial due to the lack of causality in the clinical setting. Abnormal elevation or reduction of UA levels has been linked to some of pathological status, also known as U-shaped association, implying that the physiological levels of UA regulated by multiple enzymes and transporters are crucial for the maintenance of health. In addition, the protective potential of UA has also been proposed in aging and some diseases. Therefore, the role of UA as a double-edged sword in humans is determined by its physiological or non-physiological levels. In this review, we summarize biosynthesis, membrane transport, and physiological functions of UA. Then, we discuss the pathological involvement of hyperuricemia and hypouricemia as well as the underlying mechanisms by which UA at abnormal levels regulates the onset and progression of diseases. Finally, pharmacological strategies for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) are introduced, and current challenges in UA study and future perspectives are also described.",

Risk factors include male sex; obesity; hypertension; alcohol intake; diuretic use; a diet rich in meat and seafood; chronic kidney disease; a diet heavy in fructose-rich food and beverages; being a member of certain ethnic groups, including Taiwanese, Pacific Islander, and New Zealand Maori; and living in high-income countries. Gout is characterized by swelling, pain, or tenderness in a peripheral joint or bursa, including the development of a tophus. Diagnosis of gout can be made using several validated clinical prediction rules. Arthrocentesis should be performed when suspicion for an underlying septic joint is present; synovial fluid or tophus analysis should be performed if the diagnosis is uncertain. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout episodes. Indications for long-term urate-lowering therapy include chronic kidney disease, two or more flare-ups per year, urolithiasis, the presence of tophus, chronic gouty arthritis, and joint damage. Allopurinol and febuxostat are used to prevent flare-ups, although febuxostat is associated with an increase in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and is therefore not routinely recommended.",

Although hyperuricemia has been associated with CKD in many studies, it remains controversial whether this is the cause or the result of decreased renal function. Recent observational studies of healthy populations and patients with CKD have reported that uric acid (UA) has an independent role in the development or progression of CKD. Experimental studies have shown several potential mechanisms by which hyperuricemia may cause or promote CKD. However, other reports have indicated an association between hypouricemia and CKD. This opposing effect is hypothesized to occur because UA is a major antioxidant in human plasma and is associated with oxidative stress.

Gut microbiota has been linked to the development of hyperuricemia through unclear mechanisms. Here, we show that the abundance and centrality of Alistipes indistinctus are depleted in subjects with hyperuricemia. Integrative metagenomic and metabolomic analysis identified hippuric acid as the key microbial effector that mediates the uric-acid-lowering effect of A. indistinctus. Mechanistically, A. indistinctus-derived hippuric acid enhances the binding of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) to the promoter of ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), which in turn boosts intestinal urate excretion. To facilitate this enhanced excretion, hippuric acid also promotes ABCG2 localization to the brush border membranes in a PDZ-domain-containing 1 (PDZK1)-dependent manner. These findings indicate that A. indistinctus and hippuric acid promote intestinal urate excretion and offer insights into microbiota-host crosstalk in the maintenance of uric acid homeostasis.",

We identify a gene cluster that encodes key steps of anaerobic purine degradation and that is widely distributed among gut-dwelling bacteria. Furthermore, we show that colonization of gnotobiotic mice with purine-degrading bacteria modulates levels of UA and other purines in the gut and systemically. Thus, gut microbes are important drivers of host global purine homeostasis and serum UA levels, and gut bacterial catabolism of purines may represent a mechanism by which gut bacteria influence health.",

      "title": "New insights into purine metabolism in metabolic diseases: role of xanthine oxidoreductase activity.",
      "abstract": "Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) consists of two different forms, xanthine dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase (XO), and is a rate-limiting enzyme of uric acid production from hypoxanthine and xanthine. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and has a powerful antioxidant effect. The lack of ascorbic acid, known as vitamin C, in hominoids has been thought to cause a compensatory increase in uric acid as an antioxidant by unfunctional gene mutation of uricase to a pseudogene. Because XO is involved in an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by generating superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, inadequate activation of XOR promotes oxidative stress-related tissue injury. Plasma XOR activity is associated with obesity, smoking, liver dysfunction, hyperuricemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and adipokines, indicating a novel biomarker of metabolic disorders. However, XOR activity in adipose tissue is low in humans unlike in rodents, and hypoxanthine is secreted from human adipose tissue. The concentration of hypoxanthine, but not xanthine, is independently associated with obesity in a general population, indicating differential regulation of hypoxanthine and xanthine. Treatment with an XOR inhibitor can decrease uric acid for preventing gout, reduce production of XO-related ROS, and promote reutilization of hypoxanthine and ATP production through the salvage pathway. It has recently been suggested that discontinuation of an XOR inhibitor causes adverse cardiovascular outcomes as XOR inhibitor withdrawal syndrome, possibly due to cardiac disturbance of conduction and contraction by reduced ATP production. New insights into purine metabolism, including the role of XOR activity in the past 5 yr, are mainly discussed in this review.",

Most previous studies have focused on the pathophysiologic effects of high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia). More recently, research has also shifted to the impact of hypouricemia, with multiple studies showing the potentially damaging effects that can be caused by abnormally low levels of SUA. Along with these observations, recent inconclusive data from human studies evaluating the treatment of hyperuricemia with xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) inhibitors have added to the debate about the causal role of UA in human disease processes. SUA, which is largely derived from hepatic degradation of purines, appears to exert both systemic pro-inflammatory effects that contribute to disease and protective antioxidant properties. XOR, which catalyzes the terminal two steps of purine degradation, is the major source of both reactive oxygen species (O2",

Overwhelming evidence shows the vital interrelationship between hyperuricemia (HUA) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the mechanisms for this association remain unclear. In this study, we established a urate oxidase-knockout (Uox-KO) mouse model by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology. To study the correlation between HUA and NAFLD, human HepG2 hepatoma cells were treated in culture medium with high level of uric acid. In vivo, the Uox-KO mice spontaneously developed hyperuricemia and aberrant lipid-metabolism, concomitant with abnormal hepatic fat accumulation. HUA activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, inhibiting JNK activation by a JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, decreased fat accumulation and lipogenic gene expression induced by HUA. Overexpression of the lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 was via activation of JNK, which was blocked by the JNK inhibitor SP600125. HUA activated AP-1 to upregulate lipogenic gene expression via JNK activation. In addition, HUA caused mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species production.

Medications are an important cause of hypouricemia. They can cause hypouricemia by a variety of mechanisms. Drug-induced hypouricemia mostly occurs as overtreatment of hyperuricemia by urate-lowering therapies including xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uricosuric agents and uricases.

      "abstract": "Excessive inflammatory reactions caused by uric acid deposition are the key factor leading to gout. However, clinical medications cannot simultaneously remove uric acid and eliminate inflammation. An M2 macrophage-erythrocyte hybrid membrane-camouflaged biomimetic nanosized liposome (USM[H]L) is engineered to deliver targeted self-cascading bienzymes and immunomodulators to reprogram the inflammatory microenvironment in gouty rats. The cell-membrane-coating endow nanosomes with good immune escape and lysosomal escape to achieve long circulation time and intracellular retention times. After being uptaken by inflammatory cells, synergistic enzyme-thermo-immunotherapies are achieved: uricase and nanozyme degraded uric acid and hydrogen peroxide, respectively; bienzymes improved the catalytic abilities of each other; nanozyme produced photothermal effects; and methotrexate has immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. The uric acid levels markedly decrease, and ankle swelling and claw curling are effectively alleviated. The levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS decrease, while the anti-inflammatory cytokine levels increase. Proinflammatory M1 macrophages are reprogrammed to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Notably, the IgG and IgM levels in USM[H]L-treated rats decrease substantially, while uricase-treated rats show high immunogenicity. Proteomic analysis show that there are 898 downregulated and 725 upregulated differentially expressed proteins in USM[H]L-treated rats. The protein-protein interaction network indicates that the signaling pathways include the spliceosome, ribosome, purine metabolism, etc.",

      "abstract": "Purines are abundant among organic nitrogen sources and have high nitrogen content. Accordingly, microorganisms have evolved different pathways to catabolize purines and their metabolic products such as allantoin. Enterobacteria from the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella and Salmonella have three such pathways. First, the HPX pathway, found in the genus Klebsiella and very close relatives, catabolizes purines during aerobic growth, extracting all four nitrogen atoms in the process. This pathway includes several known or predicted enzymes not previously observed in other purine catabolic pathways. Second, the ALL pathway, found in strains from all three species, catabolizes allantoin during anaerobic growth in a branched pathway that also includes glyoxylate assimilation. This allantoin fermentation pathway originally was characterized in a gram-positive bacterium, and therefore is widespread. Third, the XDH pathway, found in strains from Escherichia and Klebsiella spp., at present is ill-defined but likely includes enzymes to catabolize purines during anaerobic growth. Critically, this pathway may include an enzyme system for anaerobic urate catabolism, a phenomenon not previously described. Documenting such a pathway would overturn the long-held assumption that urate catabolism requires oxygen. Overall, this broad capability for purine catabolism during either aerobic or anaerobic growth suggests that purines and their metabolites contribute to enterobacterial fitness in a variety of environments.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of gout treatment is to alleviate symptoms of flares, prevent flares from recurring by lowering serum urate, and minimize structural joint damage and functional impairment. In recent years, several new medications to treat gout have been developed, and novel agents continue to be investigated, in addition to several long-established treatments. Although a number of effective therapies are available, optimal management and outcomes are frequently not achieved due to physician under prescribing of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and poor adherence with therapy when it is prescribed. This article reviews recent developments in the management of gout with reference to recently published clinical guidelines, outlines some important questions regarding the safety and efficacy of particular agents, and remaining gaps in our knowledge about the most effective strategies for using currently available treatments.",

      "abstract": "Gout, the most common arthritis worldwide, is closely linked to cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The most impor-tant risk factor for developing gout is hyperuricemia. Serum uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism and can be partially influenced by dietary changes. Since a quarter of serum uric acid is excreted via the intestine, there is also a connection with diet here - keyword microbiome. Recently, genetic predispositions and drug therapy for gout have come to the fore. However, since cardiovascular comorbidities exist in high frequency, a dietary adjustment also makes sense to improve the comorbidities. Recently, the focus has shifted away from simply reducing purine intake in favor of introducing a largely plant-based diet. Reducing alcohol consumption makes sense for many reasons but does not lead to a significant reduction in serum uric acid. In addition to drug therapy, however, all possibilities should be exploited to enable a rapid reduction in serum uric acid to the target range; a change in diet can contribute to this. A change in diet can also have a positive effect on the frequency of gout flares. Targeted, structured information for patients promotes their knowledge of the disease and motivation to achieve their serum uric acid (SUA) goal. The right diet may be the personal contribution to quickly reaching the SUA target level and freedom from gout flares.",

In this paper, the catalytic oxidation capacity, enzyme adsorption effect, conductivity, robustness, detection range, and detection limit of uric acid sensors were discussed and compared. Finally, the advantages of acid-sensitive electrochemical biosensors were summarized, and the constructive recommendations were proposed for improving the deficiencies of acid biosensors. The potential for further development in this area was also discussed.",

In this review, we highlight the study of UA transport and transporters. This is an evolving field, and we expect our knowledge of the transport mechanisms to both widen and deepen further. We focus on the best-characterized transporters rather than an exhaustive catalog of all suspected transporters. We review the established and novel compounds that modulate UA transport.",

      "abstract": "Serum uric acid (SUA) has garnered an increased interest in recent years as an important determinant of cardiovascular disease. Uric acid, a degradation product of purine metabolism, is affected by several inheritable and acquired factors, such as genetic mutation, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and medication interactions. Even though elevated SUA have been commonly associated with the development of gout, it has significant impact in the development of hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Uric acid, in both crystalline and soluble forms, plays a key role in the induction of inflammatory cascade and development of atherosclerotic diseases. This concise reappraisal emphasizes key features about the complex and challenging role of uric acid in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. It explores the pathogenesis and historical significance of uric acid, highlights the complex interplay between uric acid and components of metabolic syndrome, focuses on the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of uric acid, as well as discusses the role of urate lowering therapies in mitigating the risk of cardiovascular disease while providing the latest evidence to the healthcare professionals focusing on the clinical importance of SUA levels with regards to cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "Theobromine (or 3,7-dimethylxanthine) is a natural alkaloid present in cocoa plant and its derivatives, such as chocolate. About 20% of ingested theobromine is excreted unchanged in the urine. Theobromine also derived from caffeine that is metabolized into theobromine by 12%. The primary metabolites of theobromine are 3-methylxantine, 7-methylxantine, 7-methyluric acid and 3,7-dimethyluric acid. Theobromine has an inhibitory activity of uric acid crystallization, because it has a structural pattern very similar to uric acid and can substitute uric acid molecules in the corresponding uric acid crystals, making them longer and thinner and decreasing their growth rate. Theobromine also favors the dissolution of crystals by decreasing supersaturation of uric acid by forming aggregates with uric acid through hydrogen bonds and aromatic stacking interactions (-stacking bonds) increasing urinary solubility of uric acid. Theobromine can be used for uric acid stone dissolution in combination with alkalinization to reduce the dose of citrate, thus preventing excessive alkalinization and the risk of formation of sodium urate crystals. Theobromine could also be used to treat patient with xanthine stones that cannot be dissolved by alkalinization because the solubility of xanthine is relatively independent of urinary pH. A metabolite of theobromine, 7-methylxanthine, has the potential to be used for the prevention of the formation of sodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid of gouty patients.",

      "abstract": "Uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, plays a significant role in hypertension Research on uric acid has advanced significantly, particularly regarding its links to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our 2023 review covered the relationship between uric acid, hypertension; and CVD, however, numerous new studies have emerged since then. This paper provides an update, summarizing recent findings over the past two years on hyperuricemia and its association with hypertension, preeclampsia, arteriosclerosis, kidney disease, sleep-disordered breathing, CVD, and so on. Hyperuricemia, often driven by reduced uric acid excretion or increased production, is influenced by genetic factors and lifestyle habits, including high-purine foods, alcohol, and fructose intake. While hyperuricemia has been proposed to contribute to hypertension and CVD through mechanisms like inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, its causal role remains debated. Further clinical and basic science studies on hyperuricemia and purine metabolism are necessary to clarify its impact on CVD and guide therapeutic approaches.",

      "title": "A phenome-wide association and factorial Mendelian randomization study on the repurposing of uric acid-lowering drugs for cardiovascular outcomes.",
      "abstract": "Uric acid has been linked to various disease outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether uric acid-lowering therapy could be repurposed as a treatment for conditions other than gout. We first performed both observational phenome-wide association study (Obs-PheWAS) and polygenic risk score PheWAS (PRS-PheWAS) to identify associations of uric acid levels with a wide range of disease outcomes. Then, trajectory analysis was conducted to explore temporal progression patterns of the observed disease outcomes. Finally, we investigated whether uric acid-lowering drugs could be repurposed using a factorial Mendelian randomization (MR) study design. A total of 41 overlapping phenotypes associated with uric acid levels were identified by both Obs- and PRS- PheWASs, primarily cardiometabolic diseases. The trajectory analysis illustrated how elevated uric acid levels contribute to cardiometabolic diseases, and finally death. Meanwhile, we found that uric acid-lowering drugs exerted a protective role in reducing the risk of coronary atherosclerosis (OR = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.93, 1.00, P = 0.049), congestive heart failure (OR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.42, 0.99, P = 0.043), occlusion of cerebral arteries (OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.87, 1.00, P = 0.044) and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 0.60, 95%CI: 0.38, 0.94, P = 0.025). Furthermore, the combination of uric acid-lowering therapy (e.g. xanthine oxidase inhibitors) with antihypertensive treatment (e.g. calcium channel blockers) exerted additive effects and was associated with a 6%, 8%, 8%, 10% reduction in risk of coronary atherosclerosis, heart failure, occlusion of cerebral arteries and peripheral vascular disease, respectively. Our findings support a role of elevated uric acid levels in advancing cardiovascular dysfunction and identify potential repurposing opportunities for uric acid-lowering drugs in cardiovascular treatment.",

      "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disease caused by purine nucleotide metabolism disorder. The prevalence of hyperuricemia is increasing worldwide, with a growing trend in the younger populations. Although numerous studies have indicated that hyperuricemia may be an independent risk factor for insulin resistance, the causal relationship between the two is controversial. There are few reviews, however, focusing on the relationship between uric acid (UA) and insulin resistance from experimental studies. In this review, we summarized the experimental models related to soluble UA-induced insulin resistance in pancreas and peripheral tissues, including skeletal muscles, adipose tissue, liver, heart/cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. In addition, we summarized the research advances about the key mechanism of UA-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, we attempt to identify novel targets for the treatment of hyperuricemia-related insulin resistance. Lastly, we hope that the present review will encourage further researches to solve the chicken-and-egg dilemma between UA and insulin resistance, and provide strategies for the pathogenesis and treatment of hyperuricemia related metabolic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by elevated serum uric acid levels. Soluble urate can activate immune responses, and the excessive accumulation of urate in the kidneys results in hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN). However, the lack of an established HN model is a major obstacle to advancing research into the pathogenesis of HN and the development of novel drugs. In this study, we generated and evaluated an optimized mouse model of HN by the combined administration of potassium oxonate and hypoxanthine at various dosages. Our results demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg potassium oxonate with gavage of 500 mg/kg hypoxanthine caused renal injury in mice, as evidenced by the elevation in serum uric acid, serum creatinine, and 24 h albuminuria levels, as well as pathological changes in renal histology. Intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg potassium oxonate with gavage of 500 mg/kg hypoxanthine markedly increased the production of uric acid, inhibited uricase activity, and disrupted uric acid transporters. This led to supersaturated urate deposition in the kidneys, triggering renal inflammation and fibrosis, thereby promoting HN progression. In conclusion, we successfully established a stable and efficient mouse model that can mimic the pathogenesis of HN. This novel model may facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and the development of new drugs for the treatment of HN.",

Hyperuricemia (HUA) occurs when UA production exceeds excretion. Many studies have found that elevated UA is associated with diabetic microvascular complications (DMC), including diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). In addition, too high or too low UA levels will promote the occurrence and development of chronic diseases, but the relationship between UA and diabetic microvascular complications (DMC) is not clear. Therefore, the rational treatment of UA in patients with diabetes is essential. In this review, we summarize and discuss the mechanism and treatment of UA and DMC and may provide potential advice for rational drug selection.",

      "abstract": "Studies have shown inconsistent results regarding the effects of tea drinking on serum uric acid (SUA) and hyperuricemia (HUA). Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the association between tea drinking and SUA levels and HUA. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases for relevant articles published up to August 2024 that examined the association between tea drinking, SUA levels, and HUA. The types of tea were categorized as green tea and black tea. A random effects model was used to assess the combined effect sizes of the included studies and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was assessed using the Egger test. We included 16 studies involving 285,221 participants that investigated the effect of tea drinking on SUA levels and HUA. Seven papers explored the association between tea drinking and SUA levels. The results showed that the highest and lowest tea consumption categories were associated with elevated SUA levels (WMD = 9.76 μmol/L, 95% CI: 2.03, 17.49, P = 0.013). For the prevalence of HUA, 10 studies were included. There was no significant difference in the overall multivariate corrected ratio (OR) between the highest and lowest tea consumption categories (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.42, P = 0.097). The available data suggest that tea drinking may be associated with elevated SUA levels. However, the current evidence does not demonstrate an association between tea drinking and elevated HUA prevalence. Due to the limited number of studies, further well-designed prospective studies and randomized controlled trials are needed to elaborate on these issues.",

Current pharmacological strategies targeting uric acid reduction have potential adverse effects. Following the concept of \"homology of medicine and food\", food ingredients are increasingly being explored to prevent HUA and gout, with xanthine oxidase (XOD) emerging as a crucial therapeutic target in managing HUA. Recent scientific investigations have determined that uric acid-lowering substances come from various food sources, such as seafood, dairy products, and agricultural products. These bioactive substances have attracted wide attention because of their effective antihyperuricemia and XOD inhibitory ability. In this study, the pathogenesis, many side effects of uric acid-lowering drugs, and some components of uric acid-lowering drugs are mainly described, with emphasis on the source, composition, preparation technology, and mechanism of uric acid-lowering peptides.",

Findings from different studies highlighted the beneficial and detrimental effects of serum uric acid on the development and progression of NDs. Therefore, this mini-review aims to discuss the beneficial and detrimental effects of uric on NDs. The neuroprotective effect of uric acid is mainly related to the antioxidant effect of uric acid which alleviates oxidative stress-induced neurodegeneration in AD and PD. However, long-term effect of hyperuricemia prompts for the development and progression of cognitive impairment. Hyperuricemia is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, and gout increases dementia risk. In addition, hyperuricemia can cause cerebral vascular injury which is a risk factor for vascular dementia and cognitive impairment. Taken together, the relationship between uric acid and NDs risk remains conflicting. Hence, preclinical and clinical studies are indicated in this regard.",

      "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is a crucial feature of metabolic syndrome, characterized by elevated uric acid that causes urate crystal deposits in joints, kidneys, and subcutaneous tissues, resulting in gout and hyperuricemic nephropathy. The primary causes of uric acid metabolism disorder include overproduction and reduced excretion. The majority of uric acid in human body is derived from the breakdown of purine nucleotides. Overproduction of uric acid can result from increased concentration or activity of xanthine oxidase, the key enzyme responsible for uric acid synthesis. Alterations in the activity of proteins responsible for uric acid reabsorption and excretion can also affect serum uric acid. Many bioactive compounds derived from natural plants have been shown to inhibit xanthine oxidase activity to reduce uric acid production, modulate the activity of transport proteins to promote uric acid excretion, or alleviate oxidative stress and inflammation through various signaling pathways. These properties have garnered significant attention from researchers. In this paper, we first introduce the pathophysiological mechanisms of hyperuricemia, then summarize bioactive compounds with urate-lowering effects, and discuss their potential applications in treating hyperuricemia and its complications.",

      "abstract": "White adipose tissue stores fatty acid (FA) as triglyceride in the lipid droplet organelle of highly specialized cells known as fat cells or adipocytes. Depending on the nutritional state and energy demand, hormonal and biochemical signals converge on activating an elegant and fundamental process known as lipolysis, which involves triglyceride hydrolysis to FAs. Almost six decades of work have vastly expanded our knowledge of lipolysis from enzymatic processes to complex protein assembly, disassembly, and post-translational modification. Research in recent decades ushered in the discovery of new lipolytic enzymes and coregulators and the characterization of numerous factors and signaling pathways that regulate lipid hydrolysis on transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. This review will discuss recent developments with particular emphasis on the past two years in enzymatic lipolytic pathways and transcriptional regulation of lipolysis. We will summarize the positive and negative regulators of lipolysis, the adipose tissue microenvironment in lipolysis, and the systemic effects of lipolysis. The dynamic nature of adipocyte lipolysis is emerging as an essential regulator of metabolism and energy balance, and we will discuss recent developments in this area.",

Multiple parallel 'hits' have been proposed for developing hepatic steatosis, NASH, and MAFLD, including insulin resistance and subsequent free fatty acid excess, de novo lipogenesis, and excessive hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol deposition in the liver. This lead to defective beta-oxidation in the mitochondria and VLDL export and increased inflammation. Given the significant cardiovascular risk, dyslipidemia associated with MAFLD should be managed by lifestyle changes and lipid-lowering agents such as statins, fenofibrate, and omega-3 fatty acids, with judicious use of insulin-sensitizing agents, and adequate control of dysglycemia.",

      "title": "The impact of fasting on adipose tissue metabolism.",
      "abstract": "Fasting and starvation were common occurrences during human evolution and accordingly have been an important environmental factor shaping human energy metabolism. Humans can tolerate fasting reasonably well through adaptative and well-orchestrated time-dependent changes in energy metabolism. Key features of the adaptive response to fasting are the breakdown of liver glycogen and muscle protein to produce glucose for the brain, as well as the gradual depletion of the fat stores, resulting in the release of glycerol and fatty acids into the bloodstream and the production of ketone bodies in the liver. In this paper, an overview is presented of our current understanding of the effects of fasting on adipose tissue metabolism. Fasting leads to reduced uptake of circulating triacylglycerols by adipocytes through inhibition of the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme lipoprotein lipase. In addition, fasting stimulates the degradation of stored triacylglycerols by activating the key enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase. The mechanisms underlying these events are discussed, with a special interest in insights gained from studies on humans. Furthermore, an overview is presented of the effects of fasting on other metabolic pathways in the adipose tissue, including fatty acid synthesis, glucose uptake, glyceroneogenesis, autophagy, and the endocrine function of adipose tissue.",

      "title": "Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and cardiovascular diseases.",
      "abstract": "The global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continues to rise steadily, making it a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Atherosclerosis (AS) serves as a primary driver of these conditions, commencing silently at an early age and culminating in adverse cardiovascular events that severely impact patients' quality of life or lead to fatality. Dyslipidemia, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), plays a pivotal role in AS pathogenesis as an independent risk factor. Research indicates that abnormal LDL-C accumulation within arterial walls acts as a crucial trigger for atherosclerotic plaque formation. As the disease progresses, plaque accumulation may rupture or dislodge, resulting in thrombus formation and complete blood supply obstruction, ultimately causing myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and other common adverse cardiovascular events. Despite adequate pharmacologic therapy targeting LDL-C reduction, patients with cardiometabolic abnormalities remain at high risk for disease recurrence, highlighting the importance of addressing lipid risk factors beyond LDL-C. Recent attention has focused on the causal relationship between triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs), and their remnants in AS risk. Genetic, epidemiologic, and clinical studies suggest a causal relationship between TRLs and their remnants and the increased risk of AS, and this dyslipidemia may be an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Particularly in patients with obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, disordered TRLs and its remnants levels significantly increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease development. Accumulation of over-synthesized TRLs in plasma, impaired function of enzymes involved in TRLs lipolysis, and impaired hepatic clearance of cholesterol-rich TRLs remnants can lead to arterial deposition of TRLs and its remnants, promoting foam cell formation and arterial wall inflammation. Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of TRLs-induced AS and targeting it therapeutically could slow or impede AS progression, thereby reducing cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, particularly coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.",

      "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase regulates triglyceride hydrolysis and contributes to cellular uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants. Multiple pathways modulate lipoprotein lipase activity, which has prompted interest in the development of drugs that increase lipoprotein lipase activity as means to reduce risk for acute pancreatitis, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis through reduction of circulating triglycerides and remnant cholesterol. The authors provide an overview of the target populations for agents that lower triglycerides and remnant cholesterol through increased lipoprotein lipase activity, the drugs being developed for these indications, including apolipoprotein C-III and angiopoietin-like protein 3, 3/8, and 4 inhibitors, and the epidemiologic and genetic evidence supporting the use of these drugs for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and acute pancreatitis. In addition, the authors provide a corresponding overview of fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues that share many characteristics with these novel triglyceride-lowering drugs. Apolipoprotein C-III inhibitors, angiopoietin-like protein 3, 3/8, and 4 inhibitors, and fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues have pronounced triglyceride-lowering and remnant cholesterol-lowering effects. In clinical trials, apolipoprotein C-III inhibitors have been shown to lower risk for acute pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and are approved for this indication, while fibroblast growth factor-21 analogues reduce hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It remains to be seen whether these novel drugs may lower risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as well.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) still being the most common cause of death in worldwide. In spite of development of new lipid-lowering therapies which optimize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, recurrence of CVD events implies addressing factors related with residual cardiovascular (CV) risk. The key determinants of residual CV risk include triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and remnant cholesterol (RC), lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and inflammation including its biochemical markers such as high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP). On the other hand, unhealthy lifestyle habits, environmental pollution, residual thrombotic risk and the residual metabolic risk determined by obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have a specific weight in the residual CV risk. New pharmacologic therapies and pathways are being explored such as inhibition of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) and angiopoietin-related protein 3 (ANGPTL3) in order to explore if a reduction in TRLs and RC reduce CVD events. Therapeutic target of inflammation plays an attractive way to reduce the atherosclerotic process and to date, approved therapies as colchicine plays a beneficial effect in chronic inflammation and residual CV risk. Lp(a) constitutes one of the most residual CV risk factor due to linkage with CVD and aortic valve stenosis. New and hopeful treatments including antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) and small-interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) which interfere in LP(a) codification have been developed to achieve an adequate control in Lp(a) levels. This review points out the paradigms of residual CV risk, discus how we should manage their features and summarize the different therapies targeting each residual CV risk factor.",

      "abstract": "In response to inflammatory activation by pathogens, macrophages accumulate triglycerides in intracellular lipid droplets. The mechanisms underlying triglyceride accumulation and its exact role in the inflammatory response of macrophages are not fully understood. Here, we aim to further elucidate the mechanism and function of triglyceride accumulation in the inflammatory response of activated macrophages. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated activation markedly increased triglyceride accumulation in macrophages. This increase could be attributed to up-regulation of the hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet–associated (HILPDA) protein, which down-regulated adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) protein levels, in turn leading to decreased ATGL-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis. The reduction in ATGL-mediated lipolysis attenuated the inflammatory response in macrophages after ex vivo and in vitro activation, and was accompanied by decreased production of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Overall, we provide evidence that LPS-mediated activation of macrophages suppresses lipolysis via induction of HILPDA, thereby reducing the availability of proinflammatory lipid precursors and suppressing the production of PGE2 and IL-6.",

This review details the common sources of MCT oil, presenting critical information on the various approaches for MCT oil extraction or synthesis. Apart from conventional techniques, non-thermal processing methods that show promising prospects are analyzed. The biological effects of MCT oil are summarized, and the range of need-driven modification approaches are elaborated. A section is devoted to highlighting the recent trends in the application of MCT oil for food, nutraceuticals, and allied applications. While much is debated about the role of MCT oil in human health and wellness, there is limited information on daily requirements, impact on specific population groups, and effects of long-term consumption. Nonetheless, several studies have been conducted and continue to identify the most effective methods for MCT oil extraction, processing, handling, and storage.

Research has demonstrated that it can serve as an effective alternative biomarker for insulin resistance (IR) due to its high sensitivity and specificity. The TyG index is straightforward to compute and imposes fewer time and cost constraints, rendering it suitable for large populations and advantageous for use in various applications, clinical settings, and epidemiological investigations. Numerous high-quality clinical studies have underscored the significance of the TyG index in diverse medical conditions. This review provides a synthesis of the association between the TyG index and diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, fatty liver, kidney diseases, and reproductive system diseases. Furthermore, the TyG index has exhibited predictive capabilities for identifying IR in children and adolescents. Through a systematic review of pertinent clinical trials, this paper elucidates the correlation between the TyG index and various diseases. The findings presented herein suggest that the TyG index holds promise as a valuable and practical indicator for different medical conditions, prompting a reevaluation of conventional disease risk assessment paradigms and highlighting the intricate interplay of metabolic parameters with diverse diseases. By leveraging insights from the TyG index, tailored disease risk management strategies can be developed to offer a fresh perspective and guidance for clinical interventions.",

Triheptanoin has also been investigated for use as a treatment in a range of other metabolic disorders or other diseases where energy deficiency is implicated. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of triheptanoin leading to this first regulatory approval for use in the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with LC-FAOD.",

      "abstract": "The study by Liu et al in this issue of the Journal of Lipid Research leverages data from the UK Biobank to explore the impact of HDL-TG on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. The investigators observed that elevated serum triglyceride levels were associated with reduced HDL particle diameter and with increased HDL-TG. Using observational and Mendelian randomization analyses, HDL-TG levels were independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk even after adjusting for multiple confounders and other risk factors. The results emphasize the need for a broader evaluation of lipid parameters that extends beyond traditional measurements and suggest that incorporating metrics like HDL-TG could enhance risk stratification.",

Consequently, the secretion and metabolism of TRLs have a significant impact on cardiovascular health. This knowledge underscores the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms and regulation of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron biogenesis. Fortunately, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intracellular assembly, trafficking, degradation, and secretion of VLDL, leading to many ground-breaking molecular insights. Furthermore, the identification of molecular control mechanisms related to triglyceride metabolism has greatly advanced our understanding of the complex metabolism of TRLs. In this review, we explore recent advances in the assembly, secretion, and metabolism of TRLs. We also discuss available treatment strategies for hypertriglyceridemia.",

      "abstract": "Increased circulating levels of apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3) predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in humans, and APOC3 promotes atherosclerosis in mouse models. APOC3's mechanism of action is due in large part to its ability to slow the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) and their remnants when APOC3 is carried by these lipoproteins. However, different pools and forms of APOC3 exert distinct biological effects or associations with atherogenic processes. Thus, lipid-free APOC3 induces inflammasome activation in monocytes whereas lipid particle-bound APOC3 does not. APOC3-enriched LDL binds better to the vascular glycosaminoglycan biglycan than does LDL depleted of APOC3. Patterns of APOC3 glycoforms predict CVD risk differently. The function of APOC3 bound to HDL is largely unknown. There is still much to learn about the mechanisms of action of different forms and pools of APOC3 in atherosclerosis and CVD, and whether APOC3 inhibition would prevent CVD risk in patients on LDL-cholesterol lowering medications.",

      "abstract": "Triglyceride cycling is the process of continuous degradation and re-synthesis of triglyceride in cellular stores. We show in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that triglycerides are subject to rapid turnover and re-arrangement of fatty acids with an estimated half-life of 2-4 h. We develop a tracing technology that can simultaneously and quantitatively follow the metabolism of multiple fatty acids to study the triglyceride futile substrate cycle directly and with molecular species resolution. Our approach is based on alkyne fatty acid tracers and mass spectrometry. The triglyceride cycling is connected to modification of released fatty acids by elongation and desaturation. Through cycling and modification, saturated fatty acids are slowly converted to monounsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. We conclude that triglyceride cycling renders stored fatty acids accessible for metabolic alteration. The overall process facilitates cellular adjustments to the stored fatty acid pool to meet changing needs of the cell.",

This study sought to quantitatively summarize the clinical data comparing peripheral blood triglyceride (TG) concentrations between patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HCs). Studies were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases up to March 2023. We also reviewed the reference lists of obtained articles. Mean (±SD) for TG concentrations were extracted, combined quantitatively using random-effects meta-analysis, and summarized as a standardized mean difference (SMD). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression was performed to explore the resource of heterogeneity. Thirty-eight studies measuring the concentrations of peripheral blood TG in 2604 patients with MDD and 3272 HCs were included. Meta-analysis results indicated that TG levels were significant higher in patients with MDD than in HCs (SMD = 0.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16 to 0.46, Z46 = 4.05, p < 0.01). Heterogeneity was detected (χ2 = 269.97, p < 0.01, I2 = 85%). Subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences in TG levels between patients with MDD and HCs depended on age, body mass index and drug use (p < 0.05), but no differences between groups. Meta-regression also found no significant variables. TG level was significantly elevated in depression, which may explain the increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in depression.",

      "abstract": "The discovery of apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) in 2001 has raised a number of intriguing questions about its role in lipid transport and triglyceride (TG) homeostasis. Genome-wide association studies have consistently identified APOA5 as a regulator of plasma TG levels, which is further supported by studies in transgenic and knockout mouse models. The present review describes recent concepts pertaining to the roles of APOA5 in TG metabolism as related to the vascular compartment, liver, adipose tissue and the gut. Recent evidence indicates that APOA5 may also affect postprandial TG metabolism through influencing chylomicron formation and transport by the intestine into the intestinal lymph. While substantial evidence supports the notion that APOA5 plays both extracellular and intracellular roles in TG homeostasis, mysteries remain on how this low-abundance, liver-derived protein may modulate TG homeostasis, including via the gut. Given the strong correlation between elevated plasma TG and cardiometabolic diseases, there is great scientific and public interest in understanding the intriguing mysteries presented by APOA5.",

Although the association between triglyceride (TG) lowering and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction remains controversial, patients with hypertriglyceridemia may represent a subgroup that require additional therapy to further reduce residual ASCVD risk. Moreover, medications that target novel pathways could provide alternative options for patients who are intolerant of existing therapies or doses needed to provide adequate triglyceride lowering. ",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis is closely associated with inflammatory diseases, including acute pancreatitis (AP); however, the involvement of ferroptosis in hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis (HTGP) remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed to explore the relationship between lipid metabolism and ferroptosis in HTGP and the alleviating effect of liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) in vivo. This study represents the first exploration of lipid metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in HTGP, targeting ferroptosis as a key factor in HTGP. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) was induced under high-fat diet conditions. Cerulein was then injected to establish AP and HTGP models. Lip-1, a specific ferroptosis inhibitor, was administered before the induction of AP and HTGP in rats, respectively. Serum triglyceride, amylase, inflammatory factors, pathological and ultrastructural structures, lipid peroxidation, and iron overload indicators related to ferroptosis were tested. Moreover, the interaction between ferroptosis and ERS was assessed. We found HTG can exacerbate the development of AP, with an increased inflammatory response and intensified ferroptosis process. Lip-1 treatment can attenuate pancreatic injury by inhibiting ferroptosis through lipid metabolism and further resisting activations of ERS-related proteins. Totally, our results proved lipid metabolism can promote ferroptosis in HTGP by regulating ACSL4/LPCAT3 protein levels. Additionally, ERS may participate in ferroptosis via the Bip/p-EIF2α/CHOP pathway, followed by the alleviating effect of Lip-1 in the rat model.",

Remnant cholesterol is related to ASCVD risk that is independent of LDL-C and has been demonstrated in epidemiological and Mendelian randomization studies. Numerous epidemiological and genetic Mendelian randomization studies support that elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and remnant cholesterol are causally associated with ASCVD, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, aortic valve stenosis, and all-cause mortality. The remnant particles of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are highly atherogenic due to their ability to enter and be retained in the arterial wall, their high cholesterol content, and their capacity to generate foam cells, induce endothelial dysfunction, a prothrombotic environment, and a vascular inflammatory response. Assessment of remnant cholesterol can provide information about residual ASCVD risk beyond that provided by LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB, particularly in individuals with hypertriglyceridemia, type2 diabetes, or metabolic syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Medium- and long-chain triglycerides (MLCTs) integrate the metabolic advantages of medium-chain fatty acids and long-chain fatty acids, demonstrating significant potential in functional foods and infant nutrition. This review summarizes methods for chemically and enzymatically synthesizing MLCTs, highlighting that enzymatic synthesis has attracted more and more attention due to its mild reaction conditions and environmental friendliness. However, the process often involves adverse factors such as high viscosity and elevated temperatures, which compromise lipase activity, stability. To address these challenges, this article systematically examines strategies for enhancing lipase catalytic performance, including optimization of external factors, enzyme modification techniques, and computer-aided rational design. Notably, computer-aided rational design enables precise enhancement of enzymatic properties through hydration layer optimization, disulfide bond engineering, and substrate tunnel remodeling. These innovations address critical bottlenecks in MLCTs biosynthesis and establish a theoretical framework for developing next-generation lipases with industrial applicability.",

      "abstract": "Circulating triglyceride (TG) and leukocytes, the main components of the vascular system, may impact each other and co-fuel atherosclerosis. While the causal relationship between plasma TG levels and leukocyte counts remains unclear. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to investigate the potential causal relationship between TG levels and the counts of leukocytes and their subtypes. A cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) using longitudinal healthy screening data (13,389 adults with a follow-up of 4 years) was fitted to examine the temporal relationship between them. Genetically predicted plasma TG levels were positively associated with total leukocyte counts (TLC) [β(se) = 0.195(0.01)], lymphocyte counts (LC) [β(se) = 0.196(0.019)], and neutrophil counts (NC) [β(se) = 0.086(0.01)], which remained significant after adjusting for several confounders. Inversely, the genetically predicted TLC [β(se) = 0.033(0.008)], LC [β(se) = 0.053(0.008)], and NC [β(se) = 0.034(0.008)] were positively associated with plasma TG levels. However, when all three of them were put into the MR model adjusted for each other, only LC was significantly associated with TG levels. There was no association between genetically predicted TG levels and monocyte counts (MC), basophil counts, and eosinophil counts. The results of CLPM showed that the temporal effect of elevated TLC, MC, LC, and NC on plasma TG levels was stronger than the inverse effect. Our findings suggest causal associations of plasma TG levels with TLC, LC, and NC. In turn, LC was positively associated with plasma TG levels. Additionally, elevated circulating LC may precede high plasma TG levels.",

      "abstract": "Triglycerides are critical lipids as they provide an energy source that is both compact and efficient. Due to its hydrophobic nature triglyceride molecules can pack together densely and so be stored in adipose tissue. To be transported in the aqueous medium of plasma, triglycerides have to be incorporated into lipoprotein particles along with other components such as cholesterol, phospholipid and associated structural and regulatory apolipoproteins. Here we discuss the physiology of normal triglyceride metabolism, and how impaired metabolism induces hypertriglyceridemia and its pathogenic consequences including atherosclerosis. We also discuss established and novel therapies to reduce triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.",

Studies in recent years have demonstrated a causal relationship between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is primarily due to enhanced atherogenicity of cholesterol-enriched remnants, the metabolic byproducts of TRLs. Other factors influencing atherogenicity of TRLs include apolipoprotein CIII-directed proinflammatory signaling pathways and triglyceride enrichment of low-density lipoprotein that results in overabundance of small dense atherogenic particles within a prooxidative milieu that serves as the gateway for unregulated incorporation by vascular wall macrophages.

      "abstract": "There is widespread interest in fasting as a therapeutic or preventive regimen for improving health. This review provides an overview of the impact of fasting on adipose tissue metabolism, with special attention to sexually dimorphic regulation. During fasting, the storage of triacylglycerols in adipose tissue is inhibited via suppression of the extracellular lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase. By contrast, the breakdown of stored triacylglycerols and subsequent release of fatty acids and glycerol in the blood are enhanced via stimulation of the intracellular lipolytic enzymes adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. These metabolic alterations are driven by changes in humoral factors such as insulin, glucagon, corticosteroids, growth hormone, and catecholamines, as well as by neuronal pathways, and are mediated by transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of critical enzymes. Overall, fasting profoundly influences adipose tissue metabolism and leads to mobilization of stored triacylglycerols and the repartitioning of circulating triacylglycerols to nonadipose tissues.",

      "abstract": "The incidence rate of hypertriglyceridemia pancreatitis (HTGP) has experienced a notable increase in recent years, with eclipsing alcohol as the second leading cause of acute pancreatitis (AP). HTGP is often associated with more severe local and systemic complications. Recognized as a metabolic disorder hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), it holds significant relevance in the pathogenesis of HTGP, yet its mechanisms are not fully understood. Both primary (genetic) and secondary (acquired) factors contribute to elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, which concurrently influence the progression of HTGP. This article presents a comprehensive review of the evolving research on HTGP pathogenesis, encompassing lipid synthesis and metabolism, calcium signal transduction, inflammatory mediators, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, mitochondrial injury by fatty acids, oxidative stress response, genetic factors, and gene mutations. By unraveling the intricate mechanisms underlying HTGP, this article aims to enhance physicians' understanding of the disease and facilitate the development of potential targeted pharmacological interventions for patients.",

      "abstract": "Fasting triacylglycerols have long been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other cardiometabolic conditions. Evidence suggests that non-fasting triglycerides (i.e. measured within 8 h of eating) better predict CVD than fasting triglycerides, which has led several organisations to recommend non-fasting lipid panels as the new clinical standard. However, unstandardised assessment protocols associated with non-fasting triglyceride measurement may lead to misclassification, with at-risk individuals being overlooked. A third type of triglyceride assessment, postprandial testing, is more controlled, yet historically has been difficult to implement due to the time and effort required to execute it. Here, we review differences in assessment, the underlying physiology and the pathophysiological relevance of elevated fasting, non-fasting and postprandial triglycerides. We also present data suggesting that there may be a distinct advantage of postprandial triglycerides, even over non-fasting triglycerides, for early detection of CVD risk and offer suggestions to make postprandial protocols more clinically feasible.",

      "abstract": "Lipid metabolism is widely reprogrammed in tumor cells. Lipid droplet is a common organelle existing in most mammal cells, and its complex and dynamic functions in maintaining redox and metabolic balance, regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress, modulating chemoresistance, and providing essential biomolecules and ATP have been well established in tumor cells. The balance between lipid droplet formation and catabolism is critical to maintaining energy metabolism in tumor cells, while the process of energy metabolism affects various functions essential for tumor growth. The imbalance of synthesis and catabolism of fatty acids in tumor cells leads to the alteration of lipid droplet content in tumor cells. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, the enzymes that catalyze the final step of triglyceride synthesis, participate in the formation of lipid droplets in tumor cells and in the regulation of cell proliferation, migration and invasion, chemoresistance, and prognosis in tumor. Several diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 inhibitors have been developed over the past decade and have shown anti-tumor effects in preclinical tumor models and improvement of metabolism in clinical trials. In this review, we highlight key features of fatty acid metabolism and different paradigms of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 activities on cell proliferation, migration, chemoresistance, and prognosis in tumor, with the hope that these scientific findings will have potential clinical implications.",

      "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a critical enzyme in humans that provides fuel to peripheral tissues. LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides from the cores of lipoproteins that are circulating in plasma and interacts with receptors to mediate lipoprotein uptake, thus directing lipid distribution via catalytic and non-catalytic functions. Functional losses in LPL or any of its myriad of regulators alter lipid homeostasis and potentially affect the risk of developing cardiovascular disease-either increasing or decreasing the risk depending on the mutated protein. The extensive LPL regulatory network tunes LPL activity to allocate fatty acids according to the energetic needs of the organism and thus is nutritionally responsive and tissue dependent. Multiple pharmaceuticals in development manipulate or mimic these regulators, demonstrating their translational importance. Another facet of LPL biology is that the oligomeric state of the enzyme is also central to its regulation. Recent structural studies have solidified the idea that LPL is regulated not only by interactions with other binding partners but also by self-associations. Here, we review the complexities of the protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions that govern LPL structure and function.",

      "abstract": "Triglyceride (TG) metabolism is a complex and highly coordinated biological process regulated by a series of genes, and its dysregulation can lead to the occurrence of disorders in lipid metabolism. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of crucial genes in TG metabolism mediated by enhancer-promoter interactions remain elusive. Here, we identified candidate enhancers regulating the Agpat2, Dgat1, Dgat2, Pnpla2, and Lipe genes in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by integrating epigenomic data (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and DHS-seq) with chromatin three-dimensional interaction data. Luciferase reporter assays revealed that 11 enhancers exhibited fluorescence activity. The repression of enhancers using the dCas9-KRAB system revealed the functional roles of enhancers of Dgat2 and Pnpla2 in regulating their expression and TG metabolism. Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that inhibition of Dgat2-En4 downregulated pathways associated with lipid metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, and adipocyte differentiation. Additionally, overexpression and motif mutation experiments of transcription factor found that two TFs, PPARG and RXRA, regulate the activity of Agpat2-En1, Dgat2-En4, and Pnpla2-En5. Our study identified functional enhancers regulating TG metabolism and elucidated potential regulatory mechanisms of TG deposition from enhancer-promoter interactions, providing insights into understanding lipid deposition.",

      "abstract": "High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol has traditionally been considered the \"good cholesterol\", and most of the research regarding HDL cholesterol has for decades revolved around the possible role of HDL in atherosclerosis and its therapeutic potential within atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Randomized trials aiming at increasing HDL cholesterol have, however, failed and left questions to what role HDL cholesterol plays in human health and disease. Recent observational studies involving non-cardiovascular diseases have shown that high levels of HDL cholesterol are not necessarily associated with beneficial outcomes as observed for age-related macular degeneration, type II diabetes, dementia, infection, and mortality. In this narrative review, we discuss these interesting associations between HDL cholesterol and non-cardiovascular diseases, covering observational studies, human genetics, and plausible mechanisms.",

The causal relationship between plasma HDL-cholesterol levels and CVD has been called into question by Mendelian randomization studies and the majority of clinical trials not showing any benefit of plasma HDL-cholesterol raising drugs on CVD. Nonetheless, recent Mendelian randomization studies including an increased number of CVD cases compared to earlier studies have confirmed that HDL-cholesterol levels and CVD are causally linked. Moreover, several studies in large population cohorts have shown that the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL inversely correlates with CVD. Cholesterol efflux pathways exert anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects by suppressing proliferation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and inflammation and inflammasome activation in macrophages. Cholesterol efflux pathways also suppress the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages, ",

      "abstract": "Low levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with an elevated risk of arteriosclerotic coronary heart disease. Heritability of HDL-C levels is high. In this research discovery study, we used whole-exome sequencing to identify damaging gene variants that may play significant roles in determining HDL-C levels. We studied 204 individuals with a mean HDL-C level of 27.8 ± 6.4 mg/dl (range: 4-36 mg/dl). Data were analyzed by statistical gene burden testing and by filtering against candidate gene lists. We found 120 occurrences of probably damaging variants (116 heterozygous; four homozygous) among 45 of 104 recognized HDL candidate genes. Those with the highest prevalence of damaging variants were ABCA1 (n = 20), STAB1 (n = 9), OSBPL1A (n = 8), CPS1 (n = 8), CD36 (n = 7), LRP1 (n = 6), ABCA8 (n = 6), GOT2 (n = 5), AMPD3 (n = 5), WWOX (n = 4), and IRS1 (n = 4). Binomial analysis for damaging missense or loss-of-function variants identified the ABCA1 and LDLR genes at genome-wide significance. In conclusion, whole-exome sequencing of individuals with low HDL-C showed the burden of damaging rare variants in the ABCA1 and LDLR genes is particularly high and revealed numerous occurrences in HDL candidate genes, including many genes identified in genome-wide association study reports. Many of these genes are involved in cancer biology, which accords with epidemiologic findings of the association of HDL deficiency with increased risk of cancer, thus presenting a new area of interest in HDL genomics.",

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis in the eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) from 208 distinct ICUs across the United States between 2014 and 2015 that explored. All-cause mortality within 28 days after ICU admission. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to estimate the risk of death. Of the 724 patients with a median age of 68 years, 43 (5.94%) died within 28 days after ICU admission. When the non-HDLc/HDLc ratio was < 3.3, the mortality rate decreased with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.60 (95% CI 0.37-0.99, P = 0.043) for every 1 increment in the non-HDLc/HDLc ratio. When the non-HDLc/HDLc ratio was ≥ 3.3, the mortality rate increased with an adjusted OR of 1.28 (95% CI 1.01-1.62, P = 0.039) for every one increment in the non-HDLc/HDLc ratio. For patients with sepsis, the association between the non-HDLc/HDLc ratio and the 28-day mortality risk was a U-shaped curve. A higher or lower non-HDLc/HDLc ratio was associated with an increased risk of 28-day mortality.",

Medical therapy is the foundation of GDM management, for achieving optimal glycemic control often requires treatment with insulin or metformin. Gut dysbiosis is a feature of GDM pregnancies, therefore, dietary manipulation of the gut microbiota may offer a new avenue for management. Probiotics are a relatively new intervention, which can reduce the mother's blood sugar levels and, furthermore, adjust glucose and lipid metabolism in both mother and offspring.",

Using observational and Mendelian randomization analyses, HDL-TG levels were independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk even after adjusting for multiple confounders and other risk factors.

      "abstract": "High-density lipoproteins (HDL) play a key role in cholesterol homeostasis maintenance in the central nervous system (CNS), by carrying newly synthesized cholesterol from astrocytes to neurons, to support their lipid-related physiological functions. As occurs for plasma HDL, brain lipoproteins are assembled through the activity of membrane cholesterol transporters, undergo remodeling mediated by specific enzymes and transport proteins, and finally deliver cholesterol to neurons by a receptor-mediated internalization process. A growing number of evidences indicates a strong association between alterations of CNS cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegenerative disorders, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a possible role in this relationship may be played by defects in brain HDL metabolism. In the present review, we summarize and critically examine the current state of knowledge on major modifications of HDL and HDL-mediated brain cholesterol transport in AD, by taking into consideration the individual steps of this process. We also describe potential and encouraging HDL-based therapies that could represent new therapeutic strategies for AD treatment. Finally, we revise the main plasma and brain HDL modifications in other neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).",

      "abstract": "The inverse association between plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been demonstrated by numerous epidemiological studies. However, efforts to reduce CVD risk by pharmaceutically manipulating HDL-C levels failed and refused the HDL hypothesis. HDL-C levels in the general population are highly heterogeneous and are determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Insights into the causes of HDL-C heterogeneity came from the study of monogenic HDL deficiency syndromes but also from genome wide association and Μendelian randomization studies which revealed the contribution of a large number of loci to low or high HDL-C cases in the general or in restricted ethnic populations. Furthermore, HDL-C levels in the plasma are under the control of transcription factor families acting primarily in the liver including members of the hormone nuclear receptors (PPARs, LXRs, HNF-4) and forkhead box proteins (FOXO1-4) and activating transcription factors (ATFs). The effects of certain lipid lowering drugs used today are based on the modulation of the activity of specific members of these transcription factors. During the past decade, the roles of small or long non-coding RNAs acting post-transcriptionally on the expression of HDL genes have emerged and provided novel insights into HDL regulation and new opportunities for therapeutic interventions. In the present review we summarize recent progress made in the genetics and the regulation (transcriptional and post-transcriptional) of HDL metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Cholesterol is an amphipathic sterol molecule that is vital for maintaining normal physiological homeostasis. It is a relatively complicated molecule with 27 carbons whose synthesis starts with 2-carbon units. This in itself signifies the importance of this molecule. Cholesterol serves as a precursor for vitamin D, bile acids, and hormones, including estrogens, androgens, progestogens, and corticosteroids. Although essential, high cholesterol levels are associated with cardiovascular and kidney diseases and cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. Although there are some contrary reports, current literature suggests a positive association between serum cholesterol levels and the risk and extent of cancer development. In this review, we first present a brief overview of cholesterol biosynthesis and its transport, then elucidate the role of cholesterol in the progression of some cancers. Suggested mechanisms for cholesterol-mediated cancer progression are plentiful and include the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways and the induction of oxidative stress, among others. The specific roles of the lipoprotein molecules, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), in this pathogenesis, are also reviewed. Finally, we hone on the potential role of some cholesterol-lowering medications in cancer.",

      "abstract": "HDL is a complex macromolecular cluster of various components, such as apolipoproteins, enzymes and lipids. Quality evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies led to the principle that HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are inversely correlated with the risk of CHD. Nevertheless, the failure of many cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors to protect against CVD casts doubts on this principle and highlights the fact that HDL functionality, as dictated by its proteome and lipidome, also plays an important role in protecting against metabolic disorders. Recent data indicate that HDL-C levels and HDL particle functionality are correlated with the pathogenesis and prognosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a major risk factor for CVD. Hyperglycaemia leads to reduced HDL-C levels and deteriorated HDL functionality, via various alterations in HDL particles' proteome and lipidome. In turn, reduced HDL-C levels and impaired HDL functionality impact the performance of key organs related to glucose homeostasis, such as pancreas and skeletal muscles. Interestingly, different structural alterations in HDL correlate with distinct metabolic abnormalities, as indicated by recent data evaluating the role of apolipoprotein A1 and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency in glucose homeostasis. While it is becoming evident that not all HDL disturbances are causatively associated with the development and progression of type 2 diabetes, a bidirectional correlation between these two conditions exists, leading to a perpetual self-feeding cycle.",

With high conformational flexibility, its tunnel structure allows unforced movement of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), VLDLs, and LDLs. Research in reverse cholesterol transports (RCT) reveals that the regulation of CETP activity can change the concentration of cholesteryl esters (CE) in HDLs, VLDLs, and LDLs. These molecular insights demonstrate the mechanisms of CETP activities and manifest the correlation between CETP and HDL. However, animal and cell experiments focused on CETP give controversial results. Inhibiting CETP is found to be beneficial to anti-atherosclerosis in terms of increasing plasma HDL-C, while it is also claimed that CETP weakens atherosclerosis formation by promoting RCT. Currently, the CETP-related drugs are still immature. Research on CETP inhibitors is targeted at improving efficacy and minimizing adverse reactions. As for CETP agonists, research has proved that they also can be used to resist atherosclerosis.",

      "title": "Best practice for LDL-cholesterol: when and how to calculate.",
      "abstract": "The lipid profile is important in the risk assessment for cardiovascular disease. The lipid profile includes total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL-C has traditionally been calculated using the Friedewald equation (invalid with TGs greater than 4.5 mmol/L and is based on the assumption that the ratio of TG to cholesterol in very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is 5 when measured in mg /dL). LDL-C can be quantified with a reference method, beta-quantification involving ultracentrifugation and this is unsuitable for routine use. Direct measurement of LDL-C was expected to provide a solution with high TGs. However, this has some challenges because of a lack of standardisation between the reagents and assays from different manufacturers as well as the additional costs. Furthermore, mild hypertriglyceridaemia also distorts direct LDL-C measurements. With the limitations of the Friedewald equation, alternatives have been derived. Newer equations include the Sampson-National Institutes of Health (NIH) equation 2 and the Martin-Hopkins equation. The Sampson-NIH2 equation was derived using beta-quantification in a population with high TG and multiple least squares regression to calculate VLDL-C, using TGs and non-HDL-C as independent variables. These data were used in a second equation to calculate LDL-C. The Sampson-NIH2 equation can be used with TGs up to 9 mmol/L. The Martin-Hopkins equation uses a 180 cell stratification of TG/non-HDL-C to determine the TG:VLDL-C ratio and can be used with TGs up to 4.5 mmol/L. Recently, an extended Martin-Hopkins equation has become available for TGs up to 9.04 mmol/L.This article discusses the best practice approach to calculating LDL-C based on the available evidence.",

      "abstract": "Our study aimed to investigate the association between RFM and kidney stones, focusing specifically on the mediating role of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) covering the years 2007 to 2018. Our analytical approach included multivariate logistic regression modeling, subgroup analysis, generalized additive modeling (GAM), smoothed curve fitting, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, as well as mediation analysis to assess the association between RFM and kidney stones. Finally, we categorized RFM into normal and elevated groups to conduct a sensitivity analysis. This study involved 29,712 participants, with a kidney stone prevalence of 9.88%. We discovered a positive association between RFM and kidney stones (OR = 1.41 per SD increment, 95% CI: 1.24, 1.60). Subgroup analysis revealed a consistent positive association across all subgroups, with a notably higher likelihood of developing kidney stones in young adulthood (P for interaction < 0.05). The smooth curve fitting shows that RFM is nonlinearly and positively correlated with the prevalence of kidney stones. Additionally, HDL-C was found to be negatively associated with kidney stones. Importantly, HDL-C demonstrated a significant mediating effect, with a mediation ratio of 13.52%. ROC analysis indicated that RFM (AUC = 0.616) provided better diagnostic accuracy than traditional measures such as BMI (AUC = 0.565) and WC (AUC = 0.599). Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis further supports the robustness of our findings. RFM is nonlinearly and positively correlated with the prevalence of kidney stones, with HDL cholesterol playing a significant mediating role in this relationship. However, further studies are needed to confirm these associations and explore potential mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Dyslipidemia, characterized by higher serum concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and lower serum concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), is confirmed as a hallmark of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), posing serious risks to the future health of humans. Aside from the role of HDL-C concentrations, the capacity of cholesterol efflux to HDL is being identified as an enssential messurement for the dyslipidemic morbidity. Through inducing the progression of reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), the HDL-related cholesterol efflux plays a vital role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. In addition, increasing results demonstrated that the relationships between cholesterol efflux and cardiovascular events might be influenced by multiple factors, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and, inflammatory diseases. These risk factors could affect the intracellular composition of HDL, which might subsqently influence the cholesterol efflux process induced by HDL particle. In the present comprehensive article, we summarize the latest findings which described the modulatory roles of HDL in cardiometabolic disorders and inflammatory related diseases, focusing on its capacity in mediating cholesterol efflux. Moreover, the potential mechanisms whereby HDL regulate the risk of cardiometabolic disorders or inflammatory related diseases, at least partly, via cholesterol efflux pathway, are also well-listed.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Here, we review the impact of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) on sepsis from the perspective of biochemistry and pathophysiology, epidemiological research, and intervention studies in animals. Pathogen lipid moieties are major ligands for innate immunity receptors, such as toll-like receptors. The binding of pathogen-associated lipids to lipoproteins leads to sequestration, neutralization, and inactivation of their pro-inflammatory effects. Lipoproteins constitute an arm of the innate immune system. Pathogen-associated lipids can be removed from the body via the reverse lipopolysaccharide transport pathway in which HDL play a key role. Independent of the capacity for sequestration, the direct anti-inflammatory effects of HDL may counteract the development of sepsis. Mendelian randomization research using genetic variants associated with HDL cholesterol as an instrumental variable was consistent with a probable causal relationship between increased HDL cholesterol levels and decreased risk of infectious hospitalizations. Low HDL cholesterol independently predicts an adverse prognosis in sepsis both in observational epidemiology and in Mendelian randomization studies. Several HDL-associated enzymes, including phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), undergo profound changes during sepsis. Potential HDL-directed interventions for treatment of sepsis include apolipoprotein A-I-based therapies, recombinant PLTP, and CETP inhibition.",

      "abstract": "Many epidemiological studies found low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). In cell culture and animal models, HDL particles show many anti-atherogenic actions. However, until now, clinical trials did not find any prevention of ASCVD events by drugs elevating HDL-C levels, at least not beyond statins. Also, genetic studies show no associations of HDL-C levels altering variants with cardiovascular risk. Therefore, the causal role and clinical benefit of HDL-C elevation in ASCVD are questioned. However, the interpretation of previous data has important limitations: First, the inverse relationship of HDL-C with the risk of ASCVD is limited to concentrations < 60 mg/dl (< 1.5 mmol/l). Higher concentrations do not reduce the risk of ASCVD events and are even associated with increased mortality. Therefore, neither the higher-the-better strategies of earlier drug developments nor the assumption of linear cause-and-effect relationships in Mendelian randomization trials are justified. Second, most of the drugs tested so far do not act specifically on HDL metabolism. Therefore, the futile endpoint studies question the clinical benefit of the investigated drugs, but not the importance of HDL in ASCVD. Third, the vascular functions of HDL are not exerted by its cholesterol content (i.e. HDL-C), but by a variety of other molecules. Comprehensive knowledge of the structure-function-disease relationships of HDL particles and their molecules is a prerequisite for testing their physiological and pathogenic relevance and possibly for optimizing the diagnosis and treatment of persons with HDL-associated risk of ASCVD, but also for other diseases, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, infections, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.",

The importance of HDL-cholesterol as a separate risk factor is already limited, but it is necessary for the calculation of non-HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol remains an essential indicator of risk, it is needed for decision making and control of hypolipidemic therapy. Non HDL-cholesterol can be used as a therapy target instead of LDL-cholesterol.

      "abstract": "Reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol correlate with increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases and HDL performs functions including reverse cholesterol transport, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and suppression of inflammation, that would appear critical for cardioprotection. However, several large clinical trials utilizing pharmacologic interventions that elevated HDL cholesterol levels failed to provide cardioprotection to at-risk individuals. The reasons for these unexpected results have only recently begun to be elucidated. HDL cholesterol levels and HDL function can be significantly discordant, so that elevating HDL cholesterol levels may not necessarily lead to increased functional capacity, particularly under conditions that cause HDL to become oxidatively modified, resulting in HDL dysfunction. Here we review evidence that oxidative modifications of HDL, including by reactive lipid aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation, reduce HDL functionality and that dicarbonyl scavengers that protect HDL against lipid aldehyde modification are beneficial in pre-clinical models of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

      "abstract": "In individuals with very low high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) cholesterol, such as Tangier disease, LCAT deficiency, and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, there is an increased risk of premature atherosclerosis. However, analyzes based on comparisons of populations with small variations in HDL-C mediated by polygenic alterations do not confirm these findings, suggesting that there is an indirect association or heterogeneity in the pathophysiological mechanisms related to the reduction of HDL-C. Trials that evaluated some of the HDL functions demonstrate a more robust degree of association between the HDL system and atherosclerotic risk, but as they were not designed to modify lipoprotein functionality, there is insufficient data to establish a causal relationship. We currently have randomized clinical trials of therapies that increase HDL-C concentration by various mechanisms, and this HDL-C elevation has not independently demonstrated a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Therefore, this evidence shows that (a) measuring HDL-C as a way of estimating HDL-related atheroprotective system function is insufficient and (b) we still do not know how to increase cardiovascular protection with therapies aimed at modifying HDL metabolism. This leads us to a greater effort to understand the mechanisms of molecular action and cellular interaction of HDL, completely abandoning the traditional view focused on the plasma concentration of HDL-C. In this review, we will detail this new understanding and the new horizon for using the HDL system to mitigate residual atherosclerotic risk.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation and oxidative stress play a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. While myeloperoxidase carries pro-oxidant effects, HDL-cholesterol and paraoxonase have antioxidant properties. Therefore, we evaluated serum paraoxonase, myeloperoxidase, and HDL-cholesterol levels in cases with acute myeloid leukemia. Myeloperoxidase, paraoxonase, and HDL-cholesterol levels in 40 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 18 healthy individuals were determined. The relationship between these parameters and other prognostic factors, as well as their association with response to chemotherapy, was investigated. Myeloperoxidase levels were higher, while paraoxonase and HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in acute myeloid leukemia cases compared to the control group (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.006, respectively). The myeloperoxidase level was significantly negatively correlated with paraoxonase and HDL-c levels (r =  - 0.64, p < 0.001; r =  - 0.27, p = 0.02, respectively). Paraoxonase level was positively correlated with HDL level (r = 0.34, p = 0.04). Lactate dehydrogenase level was negatively correlated with HDL-c and paraoxonase levels and positively correlated with myeloperoxidase level (r =  - 0.37, p = 0.019; r =  - 0.35, p = 0.04; r = 0.45, p = 0.03, respectively). Following complete remission induction treatment, cases with complete remission had lower myeloperoxidase levels and higher HDL-cholesterol and paraoxonase levels compared to other cases (p = 0.03, p = 0.01, p = 0.04, respectively). Myeloperoxidase levels are higher, while paraoxonase and HDL-cholesterol levels are lower in acute myeloid leukemia cases. The obtained findings emphasize the potential importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. These parameters can be used as biomarkers for prognosis prediction and prediction of response to chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance causes multiple epidemic metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver, but is not routinely measured in epidemiological studies. To discover novel insulin resistance genes in the general population, we conducted genome-wide association studies in 382,129 individuals for triglyceride to HDL-cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL), a surrogate marker of insulin resistance calculable from commonly measured serum lipid profiles. We identified 251 independent loci, of which 62 were more strongly associated with TG/HDL compared to TG or HDL alone, suggesting them as insulin resistance loci. Candidate causal genes at these loci were prioritized by fine mapping with directions-of-effect and tissue specificity annotated through analysis of protein coding and expression quantitative trait variation. Directions-of-effect were corroborated in an independent cohort of individuals with directly measured insulin resistance. We highlight two phospholipase encoding genes, PLA2G12A and PLA2G6, which liberate arachidonic acid and improve insulin sensitivity, and VGLL3, a transcriptional co-factor that increases insulin resistance partially through enhanced adiposity. Finally, we implicate the anti-apoptotic gene TNFAIP8 as a sex-dimorphic insulin resistance factor, which acts by increasing visceral adiposity, specifically in females. In summary, our study identifies several candidate modulators of insulin resistance that have the potential to serve as biomarkers and pharmacological targets.",

      "abstract": "The ability to accept cholesterol from cells and to promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) represents the best characterized antiatherogenic function of HDL. Studies carried out in animal models have unraveled the multiple mechanisms by which these lipoproteins drive cholesterol efflux from macrophages and cholesterol uptake to the liver. Moreover, the influence of HDL composition and the role of lipid transporters have been clarified by using suitable transgenic models or through experimental design employing pharmacological or nutritional interventions. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), an in vitro assay developed to offer a measure of the first step of RCT, has been shown to associate with cardiovascular risk in several human cohorts, supporting the atheroprotective role of RCT in humans as well. However, negative data in other cohorts have raised concerns on the validity of this biomarker. In this review we will present the most relevant data documenting the role of HDL in RCT, as assessed in classical or innovative methodological approaches.",

Lp(a) appears to induce inflammation, atherogenesis, and thrombosis. Approximately 20% of the world's population has increased Lp(a) levels, determined predominantly by genetics. Current clinical practices for the management of dyslipidemia are ineffective in lowering Lp(a) levels. Evolving RNA-based therapeutics, such as the antisense oligonucleotide pelacarsen and small interfering RNA olpasiran, have shown promising results in reducing Lp(a) levels. Phase III pivotal cardiovascular outcome trials [Lp(a)HORIZON and OCEAN(a)] are ongoing to evaluate their efficacy in secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with elevated Lp(a). The future of cardiovascular residual risk reduction may transition to a personalized approach where further lowering of either LDL-C, triglycerides, or Lp(a) is selected after high-intensity statin therapy based on the individual risk profile and preferences of each patient.",

      "abstract": "annually in Europe, 4 million people die from cardiovascular diseases, the main cause of which is atherosclerosis. In order to slow down the development of atherosclerotic plaques, the main therapeutic goal is to lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level. Undoubtedly, statins are the basis of lipid-lowering therapy for many years. However, a European study shows that only 43% of statin-taking patients achieved their LDL-C targets. PCSK9 inhibitors are a new group of lipid-lowering drugs whose main point of action is the protein discovered in 2003 - the PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9). This protein is responsible for reducing the density of LDL receptors on the surface of hepatocytes, which increases the value of LDL-C. The discovery of this protein was soon after the basis for the start of research, thanks to which three monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 were developed - evolocumab, alirocumab, bococizumab - and inclisiran, an inhibitor of PCSK9 synthesis in the liver. In addition to the mechanism of action of PCSK9 inhibitors, resulting in lowering LDL-C level, a number of pleiotropic mechanisms have also been identified, including effects on metabolic processes and inflammation. Until the registration and introduction of above-mentioned drugs into everyday clinical practice, many studies were carried out, in which, in addition to assessing the effectiveness of treatment, the safety and tolerability of the drug were also examined. The purpose of this review is to summarize information on the safety profile of PCSK9 inhibitors, which may help in making therapeutic decision.",

      "abstract": "The extracts of red yeast rice (RYR) are currently the most effective cholesterol-lowering nutraceuticals. This activity is mainly due to monacolin K, a weak reversible inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, whose daily consumption causes a reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol plasma levels up to 15% to 25% within 6 to 8 weeks. The decrease in LDL-cholesterol is accompanied by a proportional decrease in total and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, plasma apolipoprotein B, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Some trials suggest that RYR use is associated with improvement in endothelial function and arterial stiffness, whereas a long-term study supports its role in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Despite the statin-like mechanism of action, the risk related to 3 to 10 mg monacolin K taken per day is minimal (mild myalgia in previously severely statin-intolerant subjects). RYR could represent a therapeutic tool to support lifestyle improvement in managing mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in low-risk patients, including those who cannot be treated with statins or other LDL-cholesterol-lowering therapies.",

      "abstract": "Adding to the foundation of statins, ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i), novel, emerging low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies are under development for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Inclisiran, a small interfering RNA molecule that inhibits PCSK9, only needs to be dosed twice a year and has the potential to help overcome current barriers to persistence and adherence to lipid-lowering therapies. Bempedoic acid, which lowers LDL-C upstream from statins, provides a novel alternative for patients with statin intolerance. Angiopoetin-like 3 protein (ANGPTL3) inhibitors have been shown to provide potent LDL-C lowering in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia without major adverse effects as seen with lomitapide and mipomersen, and may reduce the need for apheresis. Finally, CETP inhibitors may yet be effective with the development of obicetrapib. These novel agents provide the clinician the tools to effectively lower LDL-C across the entire range of LDL-C-induced elevation of cardiovascular risk, from primary prevention and secondary prevention to null-null homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients.",

      "title": "Therapeutic strategies targeting inflammation and immunity in atherosclerosis: how to proceed?",
      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall, characterized by the formation of plaques containing lipid, connective tissue and immune cells in the intima of large and medium-sized arteries. Over the past three decades, a substantial reduction in cardiovascular mortality has been achieved largely through LDL-cholesterol-lowering regimes and therapies targeting other traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes mellitus and obesity. However, the overall benefits of targeting these risk factors have stagnated, and a huge global burden of cardiovascular disease remains. The indispensable role of immunological components in the establishment and chronicity of atherosclerosis has come to the forefront as a clinical target, with proof-of-principle studies demonstrating the benefit and challenges of targeting inflammation and the immune system in cardiovascular disease. In this Review, we provide an overview of the role of the immune system in atherosclerosis by discussing findings from preclinical research and clinical trials. We also identify important challenges that need to be addressed to advance the field and for successful clinical translation, including patient selection, identification of responders and non-responders to immunotherapies, implementation of patient immunophenotyping and potential surrogate end points for vascular inflammation. Finally, we provide strategic guidance for the translation of novel targets of immunotherapy into improvements in patient outcomes.",

      "title": "Atherosclerotic plaque stabilization and regression: a review of clinical evidence.",
      "abstract": "Atherosclerotic plaque results from a complex interplay between lipid deposition, inflammatory changes, cell migration and arterial wall injury. Over the past two decades, clinical trials utilizing invasive arterial imaging modalities, such as intravascular ultrasonography, have shown that reducing levels of atherogenic lipoproteins, mainly serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), to very low levels can safely reduce overall atherosclerotic plaque burden and favourably modify plaque composition. Classically, this outcome has been achieved with intensive statin therapy. Since 2016, newer and potent lipid-lowering strategies, such as proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibition, have shown incremental effects on plaque regression and risk of clinical events. Despite maximal reduction in plasma LDL-C levels, considerable residual cardiovascular risk remains in some patients. Therefore, there is a need to study therapeutic approaches that address residual risk beyond LDL-C reduction to promote plaque stabilization or regression. Contemporary imaging modalities, such as coronary computed tomography angiography, enable non-invasive assessment of the overall atherosclerotic plaque burden as well as of certain local plaque characteristics. This technology could allow further study of plaque stabilization and regression using novel therapeutic approaches. Non-invasive plaque assessment might also offer the potential to guide personalized management strategies if validated for this purpose.",

The study was a randomized, controlled, feeding trial with crossover design. Twenty-four women were assigned to a 4 week ketogenic LCHF diet (4% carbohydrates; 77% fat; 19% protein) followed by a 4 week National Food Agency recommended control diet (44% carbohydrates; 33% fat; 19% protein), or the reverse sequence due to the crossover design. Treatment periods were separated by a 15 week washout period. Seventeen women completed the study and treatment effects were evaluated using mixed models.

      "title": "Best practice for LDL-cholesterol: when and how to calculate.",
      "abstract": "The lipid profile is important in the risk assessment for cardiovascular disease. The lipid profile includes total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL-C has traditionally been calculated using the Friedewald equation (invalid with TGs greater than 4.5 mmol/L and is based on the assumption that the ratio of TG to cholesterol in very- low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is 5 when measured in mg /dL). LDL-C can be quantified with a reference method, beta-quantification involving ultracentrifugation and this is unsuitable for routine use. Direct measurement of LDL-C was expected to provide a solution with high TGs. However, this has some challenges because of a lack of standardisation between the reagents and assays from different manufacturers as well as the additional costs. Furthermore, mild hypertriglyceridaemia also distorts direct LDL-C measurements. With the limitations of the Friedewald equation, alternatives have been derived. Newer equations include the Sampson-National Institutes of Health (NIH) equation 2 and the Martin-Hopkins equation. The Sampson-NIH2 equation was derived using beta-quantification in a population with high TG and multiple least squares regression to calculate VLDL-C, using TGs and non-HDL-C as independent variables. These data were used in a second equation to calculate LDL-C. The Sampson-NIH2 equation can be used with TGs up to 9 mmol/L. The Martin-Hopkins equation uses a 180 cell stratification of TG/non-HDL-C to determine the TG:VLDL-C ratio and can be used with TGs up to 4.5 mmol/L. Recently, an extended Martin-Hopkins equation has become available for TGs up to 9.04 mmol/L.This article discusses the best practice approach to calculating LDL-C based on the available evidence.",

      "abstract": "Combinations of lipid-lowering agents can often bring LDL cholesterol down to around 40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L). Randomized controlled trials indicate that this reduces the risk of atherosclerotic vascular events with minimal adverse effects. This has raised the question of whether there is any concentration of LDL cholesterol below which further lowering is futile and/or a source of new adverse effects.

      "abstract": "Lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol represents one of the most effective interventions in cardiovascular prevention. Besides the oral treatment with statins, ezetimibe and bempedoic acid, subcutaneously administered inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have been established as further cornerstones of lipid-lowering treatment. The antibodies evolocumab and alirocumab are administered subcutaneously every 2-4 weeks and lower LDL cholesterol by around 60%, independent of pre-treatment with very good tolerability. Both drugs successfully reduced cardiovascular endpoints in large outcome trials. A novel principle of PCSK9 inhibition is RNA interference, which is exploited by the novel compound inclisiran. Inclisiran is a double-stranded modified RNA molecule, which neutralizes the mRNA of PCSK9 and thus inhibits PCSK9 protein synthesis intracellularly. Inclisiran only needs to be administered every 6 months. The cardiovascular outcome trial ORION‑4 is currently ongoing. In Germany, prescription of PCSK9 inhibitors is regulated by the decision of the Federal Joint Committee. Novel strategies to inhibit PCSK9 function are under development and include orally available drugs and animal experiment concepts on gene editing, which are in different states of evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) plays a central role in lipid metabolism and is a well-established therapeutic target for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In recent years, increasingly aggressive lipid-lowering strategies have been adopted to achieve ultra-low LDL-C concentrations (<55 mg/dL or even <30 mg/dL) in high-risk patients. While the benefits of LDL-C reduction in lowering the incidence of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are well documented, emerging clinical evidence has raised concerns about a potential association between very low LDL-C levels and an increased risk of bleeding, particularly hemorrhagic stroke and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. This review critically examines the molecular mechanisms by which reduced LDL-C levels may influence the hemostatic system and vascular integrity. It explores the complex interplay between cholesterol availability and platelet function, endothelial barrier stability, and coagulation pathways. In addition, we assess experimental and clinical studies supporting this association and discuss how these findings may inform risk stratification and personalized lipid-lowering strategies. A deeper understanding of the biological basis of this paradoxical risk is essential for achieving a safe, balanced, and effective approach to cardiovascular prevention.",

Lipoprotein apheresis (LA) is applied for those patients to remove low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). DFPP is used as one of the modalities in LA. In addition to removing LDL-C and Lp(a), DFPP has pleiotropic effects such as removal of lipid metabolism-related substances, C-reactive protein lowering effect, removal of adhesion molecules, removal of inflammatory cytokines, and anti-oxidative effect.

      "abstract": "Since the discovery of statins and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) results three decades ago, remarkable advances have been made in the treatment of dyslipidaemia, a major risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Safe and effective statins remain the cornerstone of therapeutic approach for this indication, including for children with genetic dyslipidaemia, and are one of the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. However, despite the affordability of generic statins, they remain underutilised worldwide. The use of ezetimibe to further decrease plasma LDL cholesterol and the targeting of other atherogenic lipoproteins, such as triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and lipoprotein(a), are likely to be required to further reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. Drugs directed at these lipoproteins, including gene silencing and editing methods that durably suppress the production of proteins, such as PCSK9 and ANGPTL3, open novel therapeutic options to further reduce the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.",

Here, from an examination of genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), we identified variants with effects on EC function and constructed a 35 single nucleotide polymorphism polygenic risk score comprising these EC-specific variants (EC PRS). The association of the EC PRS with the risk of incident cardiovascular disease was tested in 3 cohorts: a primary prevention population in the UK Biobank (UKBB; n = 348,967); a primary prevention cohort from a trial that tested a statin (JUPITER, n = 8,749); and a secondary prevention cohort that tested a PCSK9 inhibitor (FOURIER, n = 14,298). In the UKBB, the EC PRS was independently associated with the risk of incident CAD (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) per 1 s.d. of 1.24 (95% CI 1.21-1.26), P < 2 × 10",

Total cholesterol continues to serve as a guide for the presence of dyslipoproteinemia and is necessary for the calculation of LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. The importance of HDL-cholesterol as a separate risk factor is already limited, but it is necessary for the calculation of non-HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol remains an essential indicator of risk, it is needed for decision making and control of hypolipidemic therapy. Non HDL-cholesterol can be used as a therapy target instead of LDL-cholesterol. Triglycerides remain necessary for residual risk assessment, for the calculation of LDL-cholesterol and for the diagnosis of certain types of dyslipoproteinemias.",

      "abstract": "The functional characteristics of Lactobacillus johnsonii BFE6154, first isolated from Maasai traditional fermented milk, were previously identified in vitro, but its cholesterol-lowering properties have not been verified yet. In this study, we investigated the effect of L. johnsonii BFE6154 on cholesterol regulation and the mode of action. Stimulation of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells with L. johnsonii BFE6154 downregulated the gene expression of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) through the activation of liver X receptor (LXR). Also, stimulation of HepG2 cells with the metabolites produced by L. johnsonii BFE6154 revealed an increase in the gene expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Oral administration of L. johnsonii BFE6154 in mice receiving a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD), reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL) and increased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL) in the blood, compared to the control. Diet-induced hypercholesterolemic mice receiving L. johnsonii BFE6154 showed a suppression of cholesterol absorption under the control of NPC1L1 in the intestine. Furthermore, L. johnsonii BFE6154 consumption ameliorated the hepatic cholesterol level and LDLR expression, which was reduced by HFHCD. These molecular modulations led to the increase of cholesterol excretion and the decrease of cholesterol levels in the feces and liver, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that L. johnsonii BFE6154 may protect against diet-induced hypercholesterolemia through the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in the intestine and liver.",

      "abstract": "Cholesterol is essential for a variety of functions in endocrine-related cells, including hormone and steroid production. We have reviewed the progress to date in research on the role of the main cholesterol-containing lipoproteins; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and their impact on intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and carcinogenic pathways in endocrine-related cancers. Neither LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) nor HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was consistently associated with endocrine-related cancer risk. However, preclinical studies showed that LDL receptor plays a critical role in endocrine-related tumor cells, mainly by enhancing circulating LDL-C uptake and modulating tumorigenic signaling pathways. Although scavenger receptor type BI-mediated uptake of HDL could enhance cell proliferation in breast, prostate, and ovarian cancer, these effects may be counteracted by the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of HDL. Moreover, 27-hydroxycholesterol a metabolite of cholesterol promotes tumorigenic processes in breast and epithelial thyroid cancer. Furthermore, statins have been reported to reduce the incidence of breast, prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer in large clinical trials, in part because of their ability to lower cholesterol synthesis. Overall, cholesterol homeostasis deregulation in endocrine-related cancers offers new therapeutic opportunities, but more mechanistic studies are needed to translate the preclinical findings into clinical therapies.",

      "title": "PNLIPRP1 Hypermethylation in Exocrine Pancreas Links Type 2 Diabetes and Cholesterol Metabolism.",
      "abstract": "We postulated that type 2 diabetes (T2D) predisposes patients to exocrine pancreatic diseases through (epi)genetic mechanisms. We explored the methylome (using MethylationEPIC arrays) of the exocrine pancreas in 141 donors, assessing the impact of T2D. An epigenome-wide association study of T2D identified hypermethylation in an enhancer of the pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 (PNLIPRP1) gene, associated with decreased PNLIPRP1 expression. PNLIPRP1 null variants (found in 191,000 participants in the UK Biobank) were associated with elevated glycemia and LDL cholesterol. Mendelian randomization using 2.5M SNP Omni arrays in 111 donors revealed that T2D was causal of PNLIPRP1 hypermethylation, which in turn was causal of LDL cholesterol. Additional AR42J rat exocrine cell analyses demonstrated that Pnliprp1 knockdown induced acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, a known prepancreatic cancer state, and increased cholesterol levels, reversible with statin. This (epi)genetic study suggests a role for PNLIPRP1 in human metabolism and exocrine pancreatic function, with potential implications for pancreatic diseases.",
