      "title": "The efficacy and safety of β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation in healthy middle-aged adults: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial.",
      "abstract": "In animal studies, β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentrations and improves healthspan and lifespan with great safety. However, it is unclear if these effects can be transferred to humans. This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial included 80 middle-aged healthy adults being randomized for a 60-day clinical trial with once daily oral dosing of placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg NMN. The primary objective was to evaluate blood NAD concentration with dose-dependent regimens. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of NMN supplementation, next to the evaluation of clinical efficacy by measuring physical performance (six-minute walking test), blood biological age (Aging.Ai 3.0 calculator), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and subjective general health assessment [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36)]. Statistical analysis was performed using the Per Protocol analysis with significant level set at p = 0.05. All 80 participants completed the trial without trial protocol violation. Blood NAD concentrations were statistically significantly increased among all NMN-treated groups at day 30 and day 60 when compared to both placebo and baseline (all p ≤ 0.001). Blood NAD concentrations were highest in the groups taking 600 mg and 900 mg NMN. No safety issues, based on monitoring adverse events (AEs), laboratory and clinical measures, were found, and NMN supplementation was well tolerated. Walking distance increase during the six-minute walking test was statistically significantly higher in the 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg groups compared to placebo at both days 30 and 60 (all p < 0.01), with longest walking distances measured in the 600 mg and 900 mg groups. The blood biological age increased significantly in the placebo group and stayed unchanged in all NMN-treated groups at day 60, which resulted in a significant difference between the treated groups and placebo (all p < 0.05). The HOMA-IR showed no statistically significant differences for all NMN-treated groups as compared to placebo at day 60. The change of SF-36 scores at day 30 and day 60 indicated statistically significantly better health of all three treated groups when compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05), except for the SF-36 score change in the 300 mg group at day 30. NMN supplementation increases blood NAD concentrations and is safe and well tolerated with oral dosing up to 900 mg NMN daily. Clinical efficacy expressed by blood NAD concentration and physical performance reaches highest at a dose of 600 mg daily oral intake. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04823260, and Clinical Trial Registry - India, CTRI/2021/03/032421.",

      "title": "β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide activates NAD+/SIRT1 pathway and attenuates inflammatory and oxidative responses in the hippocampus regions of septic mice.",
      "abstract": "Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) is one of the common serious complications in sepsis, and the pathogenesis of SAE remains unclear. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been reported to be downregulated in the hippocampus and SIRT1 agonists can attenuated the cognitive dysfunction in septic mice. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a key substrate to maintain the deacetylation activity of SIRT1. As an intermediate of NAD+, β-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide (NMN) has been reported to be promising in treating neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral ischemic injury. Thus we sought to investigate the potential role of NMN in SAE treatment. The SAE model was established by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in vivo, and neuroinflammation model was established with LPS-treated BV-2 cells in vitro. Memory impairment was assessed by Morris water maze and fear conditioning tests. As a result, the levels of NAD+, SIRT1 and PGC-1α were significantly reduced in the hippocampus of septic mice, while the acetylation of total lysine, phosphorylation of P38 and P65 were enhanced. All these changes induced by sepsis were inverted by NMN. Treating with NMN resulted in improved behavior performance in the fear conditioning tests and Morris water maze. Apoptosis, inflammatory and oxidative responses in the hippocampus of septic mice were attenuated significantly after NMN administration. These protective effect of NMN against memory dysfunction, inflammatory and oxidative injuries were reversed by the SIRT1 inhibitor, EX-527. Similarly, LPS-induced activation of BV-2 cells were attenuated by NMN, EX-527 or SIRT1 knockdown could reverse such effect of NMN in vitro. In conclusion, NMN is protective against sepsis-induced memory dysfunction, and the inflammatory and oxidative injuries in the hippocampus region of septic mice. The NAD+/SIRT1 pathway might be involved in one of the mechanisms of the protective effect.",

The process of mitophagy, in which the dysfunctional or superfluous mitochondria are selectively engulfed by autophagosome and subsequently degraded in lysosome, has been well formulated as one of the major mechanisms for mitochondrial quality control. To date, the PINK1-PRKN-dependent and receptors (including proteins and lipids)-dependent pathways have been characterized to determine the mitophagy in mammalian cells.

      "abstract": "Aging leads to and is associated with aberrant function of multiple signaling pathways and a host of factors that maintain cellular health. Under normal conditions, the prolongevity, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), is dedicated to the homeostasis of metabolism and autophagy for removal of damaged cellular compartments and molecules. A host of sirtuin family of molecules, that extend life-span, regulate metabolism and repair DNA damage, and possess either mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase, or deacylase activity. Another group of pro-longevity factors, include FOX (forkhead box) proteins, a family of transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and longevity. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAmPRTase or Nampt) catalyzes the condensation of nicotinamide with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate to yield nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a requisite step for production of NAD+, which is known to increase longevity. Loss of Klotho, a transmembrane enzyme that controls the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and suppresses oxidative stress and inflammation, leads to premature aging in mice. Hydrogen sulfide and transsulfuration pathways are crucial to the long life and are required in protection of cells against damage. Aging also leads to the imbalanced activation of other pathways and factors including p53, insulin and IGF signaling, P13K/AKT, mTOR, PKA, RAS, RTK, MEK, ERK, MAPK, CRTC-1/CREB and NFkB. Such aberrant cellular functions, disturb cell metabolism, derail autophagy and other housekeeping actions, inhibit cell division, induce inflammaging and immunosenecence, cause stem cell exhaustion and induce either senescence, apoptosis or cancer.",

      "abstract": "High mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have attracted worldwide attention. It has been reported that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most important mechanisms affecting the pathogenesis of CVDs. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations may result in impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), abnormal respiratory chains, and ATP production. In dysfunctional mitochondria, the electron transport chain (ETC) is uncoupled and the energy supply is reduced, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is increased. Here, we discussed and analyzed the relationship between mtDNA mutations, impaired mitophagy, decreased OXPHOS, elevated ROS, and CVDs from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we explored current potential therapeutic strategies for CVDs by eliminating mtDNA mutations (e.g., mtDNA editing and mitochondrial replacement), enhancing mitophagy, improving OXPHOS capacity (e.g., supplement with NAD",

      "abstract": "Disrupted biological function, manifesting through the hallmarks of aging, poses one of the largest threats to healthspan and risk of disease development, such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular ailments, and neurodegeneration. In recent years, numerous geroprotectors, senolytics, and other nutraceuticals have emerged as potential disruptors of aging and may be viable interventions in the immediate state of human longevity science. In this review, we focus on the decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with age and the supplementation of NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), in combination with other geroprotective compounds, to restore NAD+ levels present in youth. Furthermore, these geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NMN supplementation while concurrently providing their own numerous health benefits. By analyzing the prevention of NAD+ degradation through the inhibition of CD38 or supporting protective downstream agents of SIRT1, we provide a potential framework of the CD38/NAD+/SIRT1 axis through which geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NAD+ precursor supplementation and reduce the risk of age-related diseases, thereby potentiating healthspan in humans.",

      "abstract": "β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has shown promising effects on intestinal health, and it is extensively applied as an anti-aging and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic, due to its medicinal properties. The effects of NMN on the growth of mouse hair were observed after hair removal. The results indicated that NMN can reverse the state of hair follicle atrophy, hair thinning, and hair sparsity induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), compared to that of minoxidil. In addition, the action mechanisms of NMN promoting hair growth in cultured human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) treated with DHT were investigated in detail. The incubation of HDPCs with DHT led to a decrease in cell viability and the release of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1Beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-α). It was found that NMN can significantly lower the release of inflammatory factors induced by DHT in HDPCs. HDPCs cells are protected from oxidative stress damage by NMN, which inhibits the NF-κB p65 inflammatory signaling pathway. Moreover, the levels of androgen receptor (AR), dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), and β-catenin in the HDPCs were assessed using PCR, indicating that NMN can significantly enhance the expression of VEGF, reduced IL-6 levels and suppress the expression of AR and DKK-1, and notably increase β-catenin expression in DHT-induced HDPCs.",

      "abstract": "Preclinical studies have revealed that the elevation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) upon the administration of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD + precursor, can mitigate aging-related disorders; however, human data on this are limited. We investigated whether the chronic oral supplementation of NMN can elevate blood NAD + levels and alter physiological dysfunctions in healthy older participants. We administered 250 mg NMN per day to aged men for 6 or 12 weeks in a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial. Chronic NMN supplementation was well tolerated and caused no significant deleterious effect. Metabolomic analysis of whole blood samples demonstrated that oral NMN supplementation significantly increased the NAD + and NAD + metabolite concentrations. There were nominally significant improvements in gait speed and performance in the left grip test, which should be validated in larger studies; however, NMN exerted no significant effect on body composition. Therefore, chronic oral NMN supplementation can be an efficient NAD + booster for preventing aging-related muscle dysfunctions in humans.",

Targeted metabolomics showed that renal oxidized ARA metabolites were increased in Cd-exposed mice. Renal 4-HNE, MDA, and ACSL4, were upregulated in Cd-exposed mouse kidneys. Consistent with animal experiments, the in vitro experiments showed that mitochondrial oxidized lipids were elevated in Cd-exposed HK-2 cells.

Finding new strategies for prevention and management of liver fibrosis is urgently needed. It is known that hepatic stellate cell (HSC) is the primary source of extracellular matrix that drives liver fibrosis progression. Herein, we carried out a comprehensive secretome profiling to identify NMN-induced changes in secretory proteins and found that NMN suppressed the secretion of profibrotic protein and oxidoreductase in activated HSC (LX-2) cells, while real-time quantitative PCR analysis revealed that NMN downregulated profibrotic gene expression, resulting in HSC inactivation. Next, we demonstrated that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) reduced the accumulation of liver extracellular matrix in thioacetamide (TAA) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl",

      "abstract": "Senescence of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) impairs stemness and osteogenic differentiation, but the key regulators for senescence and the related osteogenesis are not well defined. Herein, we screened the gene expression profiles of human BMSCs from young and old donors and identified that elevation of the nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 2 (NAP1L2) expression was correlated with BMSC senescence and impaired osteogenesis. Elevated NAP1L2 expression was observed in replicative cell senescence and induced cell senescence in vitro, and in age-related senescent human and mouse BMSCs in vivo, concomitant with significantly augmented chromatin accessibility detected by ATAC-seq. Loss- and gain-of-functions of NAP1L2 affected activation of NF-κB pathway, status of histone 3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac), and chromatin accessibility on osteogenic genes in BMSCs. Mechanistic studies revealed that NAP1L2, a histone chaperone, recruited SIRT1 to deacetylate H3K14ac on promoters of osteogenic genes such as Runx2, Sp7, and Bglap and suppressed the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Importantly, molecular docking analysis showed a possible bond between NAP1L2 and an anti-aging reagent, the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and indeed, administration of NMN alleviated senescent phenotypes of BMSCs. In vivo and clinical evidence from aging mice and patients with senile osteoporosis also confirmed that elevation of NAP1L2 expression was associated with suppressed osteoblastogenesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that NAP1L2 is a regulator of both BMSC cell senescence and osteogenic differentiation, and provide a new theoretical basis for aging-related disease.",

      "abstract": "Gut microbiota-mediated colonization resistance (CR) is crucial in protecting the host from intestinal infections. Sleep deprivation (SD) is an important contributor in the disturbances of intestinal homeostasis. However, whether and how SD affects host CR remains largely unknown. Here, it is shown that SD impairs intestinal CR in mice, whereas nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation restores it. Microbial diversity and metabolomic analyses suggest that gut microbiota and metabolite profiles in SD-treated mice are highly shaped, whereas NMN reprograms these differences. Specifically, the altered gut microbiota in SD mice further incurs the disorder of secondary bile acids pool accompanied by a decrease in deoxycholic acid (DCA). Conversely, NMN supplementation retakes the potential benefits of DCA, which is associated with specific gut microbiota involved in primary bile acids metabolic flux. In animal models of infection, DCA is effective in preventing and treating bacterial infections when used alone or in combination with antibiotics. Mechanistically, DCA alone disrupts membrane permeability and aggravates oxidative damage, thereby reducing intestinal pathogen burden. Meanwhile, exogenous DCA promotes antibiotic accumulation and destroys oxidant-antioxidant system, thus potentiating antibiotic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights the important roles of gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in the maintenance of intestinal CR.",

      "abstract": "Deteriorating sleep quality and physical or mental fatigue in older adults leads to decreased quality of life and increased mortality rates. This study investigated the effects of the time-dependent intake of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) on sleep quality, fatigue, and physical performance in older adults. This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluated 108 participants divided into four groups (NMN_AM; antemeridian, NMN_PM; post meridian, Placebo_AM, Placebo_PM). NMN (250 mg) or placebo was administered once a day for 12 weeks. Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Fatigue was evaluated using the \"Jikaku-sho shirabe\" questionnaire. Grip strength, 5-times sit-to-stand (5-STS), timed up and go, and 5-m habitual walk were evaluated to assess the physical performance. Significant interactions were observed between 5-STS and drowsiness. 5-STS of all groups on post-intervention and drowsiness of the NMN_PM and Placebo_PM groups on mid- and post-intervention showed significant improvement compared with those in pre-intervention. The NMN_PM group demonstrated the largest effect size for 5-STS (d = 0.72) and drowsiness (d = 0.64). Overall, NMN intake in the afternoon effectively improved lower limb function and reduced drowsiness in older adults. These findings suggest the potential of NMN in preventing loss of physical performance and improving fatigue in older adults.",

Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids and contributes to kinds of tissue injuries. However, it remains unclear whether the accumulation of lipid peroxides in UV irradiation-induced skin injury could lead to ferroptosis. We generated UV irradiation-induced skin injury mice model to examine the accumulation of the lipid peroxides and iron. Lipid peroxides 4-HNE, the oxidative enzyme COX2, the oxidative DNA damage biomarker 8-OHdG, and the iron level were increased in UV irradiation-induced skin. The accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation was also observed in UVB-irradiated epidermal keratinocytes without actual ongoing ferroptotic cell death. Ferroptosis was triggered in UV-irradiated keratinocytes stimulated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to mimic the iron overload. Although GPX4 protected UVB-injured keratinocytes against ferroptotic cell death resulted from dysregulation of iron metabolism and the subsequent increase of lipid ROS, keratinocytes enduring constant UVB treatment were markedly sensitized to ferroptosis.

      "abstract": "Noninvasive pharmacological strategies like nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation can effectively address age-related ovarian infertility by maintaining or enhancing oocyte quality and quantity. This study revealed that ovarian nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels decline with age, but NMN administration significantly restores these levels, preventing ovarian atrophy and enhancing the quality and quantity of ovulated oocytes. Improvements in serum hormone secretion and antioxidant factors, along with decreased expression of proinflammatory factors, were observed. Additionally, a significant increase in the number of ovarian follicles in aging individuals was noted. Scanning electron microscopy data indicated that NMN significantly alters the density and morphology of lipid droplets and mitochondria in granulosa cells, suggesting potential targets and mechanisms. Transcriptomic analysis and validation experiments collectively suggested that the beneficial effects of NMN on aging ovaries are mediated through enhanced mitochondrial function, improved energy metabolism, and reduced inflammation levels. Our results suggest that NMN supplementation could improve the health status of aging ovaries and enhance ovarian reserve, offering new insights into addressing fertility challenges in older women through assisted reproductive technology.",

In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, 60 participants were randomly allocated into a placebo group or NMN group. Members of the NMN group consumed 250 mg/day NMN for 12 weeks. Motor function tests, blood NAD metabolite analysis, and questionnaires were conducted at the start of the study and 4 and 12 weeks after intake. This trial was registered at umin.ac.jp/ctr as UMIN000047871 on June 22nd, 2022.At primary outcome, at both 4 weeks and 12 weeks, the NMN and placebo groups had no significant differences in a stepping test. At secondary outcomes, after 12 weeks of NMN intake, the NMN group had a significantly shorter 4-m walking time than the placebo group as well as significantly higher blood levels of NAD + and its metabolites. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change in the 4-m walking time and the change in blood NAD + , N",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) products lacking regulatory approval are being used to self-treat a myriad of conditions and for their unsubstantiated health benefits. The scientific evidence supporting these claims largely arises not from controlled clinical trials, but from the recognition that CBD has numerous biological targets. Yet, CBD is commonly consumed and often in over-the-counter products that are unapproved and of unknown composition. Epidiolex® is the only product that has undergone rigorous pharmacokinetic assessment and testing in clinical trials; it was approved as a non-scheduled drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of intractable childhood-onset seizures. However, studies investigating CBD for other medical conditions are limited in number and often lack the scientific rigor, controls, or sample sizes required to draw clinically meaningful conclusions. Although Epidiolex® is safe for human consumption, recent changes in regulation of commercially available CBD products have resulted in limited quality control and products marketed with unknown CBD bioavailability. Even scientifically rigorous studies have used different sources of CBD and different suspension vehicles for administration, making it difficult to compare results among studies and resolve mixed outcomes.",

These therapeutic properties demonstrated by preclinical and clinical studies encompass more than just anticonvulsant, anti-arthritic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, antiemetic, antipsychotic and neuroprotective effects. It has been hypothesized that CBD holds potential in the treatment of various neuropsychiatric and anxiety disorders. Thus, PRISMA was used as a guide for our systematic review. Eight of the 1550 articles screened in June 2023 were eligible for meta-analysis. Based on the 316 participants included in these eight articles, this meta-analysis revealed a substantial significant impact of CBD on anxiety with a considerable effect size (Hedges' g = -0.92, 95% CI -1.80 to -0.04). In addition, this meta-analysis focuses on the efficacy of CBD in treating anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, caution should be exercised in interpreting our findings due to the limited size of the clinical sample, and additional trials ought to be carried out if deemed necessary.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the most prevalent form of neuropsychiatric disorder among the elderly population, impacting a minimum of 50 million individuals worldwide. Current pharmacological treatments rely on the prescribing cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. However,recently anecdotal findings based on low-quality real-world data had prompted physicians, patients, and their relatives to consider the use of cannabinoids, especially Cannabidiol (CBD), for alleviating of AD symptoms. CBD the primary non-psychotomimetic compound found in the Cannabis sp. plant, exhibits promising therapeutic potential across various clinical contexts. Pre-clinical and in vitro studies indicate that CBD could mitigate cognitive decline and amyloid-beta-induced neurodegeneration by modulating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In addition, CBD demonstrates significant effects in promoting neuroplasticity, particularly in brain regions such as the hippocampus. However, the available clinical evidence presents conflicting results, and no randomized placebo-controlled trials have been published to date. In conclusion, although pre-clinical and in vitro studies offer encouraging insights into the potential benefits of CBD in AD models, new and well-designed clinical trials are imperative to ascertain the clinical relevance of CBD use in the management of AD symptoms, especially in comparison to conventional treatments.",

CBD lacks the psychotropic effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and has shown great therapeutic potential. CBD exerts a wide spectrum of effects at a molecular, cellular, and organ level, affecting inflammation, oxidative damage, cell survival, pain, vasodilation, and excitability, among others, modifying many physiological and pathophysiological processes. There is evidence that CBD may be effective in treating several human disorders, like anxiety, chronic pain, psychiatric pathologies, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer. Multiple cellular and pre-clinical studies using animal models of disease and several human trials have shown that CBD has an overall safe profile. In this review article, we summarize the pharmacokinetics data, the putative mechanisms of action of CBD, and the physiological effects reported in pre-clinical studies to give a comprehensive list of the findings and major effects attributed to this compound.",

A review of the literature demonstrated mixed results on the efficacy of CBD in relieving pain in older adults. There is inconsistency in the labeling of over-the-counter CBD products that can result in safety issues and will require more federal quality control. Likewise, gaps in knowledge regarding safety and efficacy of CBD use in older adults are vast and require further research. [",

During this time, 39 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 13 meta-analyses on the efficacy and safety of CBD treatment have been published. Each of the meta-analyses had its own criteria for the RCTs' inclusion and, therefore, slightly different interpretations of the analyzed data. Each of them contributed in its own way to the understanding of CBD pharmacology, mechanisms of therapeutic action, development of adverse reactions, and drug-drug interactions. Hence, it seemed reasonable to gather the most relevant data in one article and present all the current knowledge on the use of CBD in epilepsy. The results of the 13 meta-analyses presented herein confirmed the effectiveness and safety of CBD in children and adolescents with DREs. In adults, reliable conclusions cannot be drawn due to insufficient data.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD), derived from Cannabis sativa, has gained remarkable attention for its potential therapeutic applications. This thorough analysis explores the increasing significance of CBD in treating neurological conditions including epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, which present major healthcare concerns on a worldwide scale. Despite the lack of available therapies, CBD has been shown to possess a variety of pharmacological effects in preclinical and clinical studies, making it an intriguing competitor. This review brings together the most recent findings on the endocannabinoid and neurotransmitter systems, as well as anti-inflammatory pathways, that underlie CBD's modes of action. Synthesized efficacy and safety assessments for a range of neurological illnesses are included, covering human trials, in vitro studies, and animal models. The investigation includes how CBD could protect neurons, control neuroinflammation, fend off oxidative stress, and manage neuronal excitability. This study emphasizes existing clinical studies and future possibilities in CBD research, addressing research issues such as regulatory complications and contradicting results, and advocates for further investigation of therapeutic efficacy and ideal dose methodologies. By emphasizing CBD's potential to improve patient well-being, this investigation presents a revised viewpoint on its suitability as a therapeutic intervention for neurological illnesses.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol and pain.",
      "abstract": "Chronic pain presents significant personal, psychological, and socioeconomic hurdles, impacting over 30% of adults worldwide and substantially contributing to disability. Unfortunately, current pharmacotherapy often proves inadequate, leaving fewer than 70% of patients with relief. This shortfall has sparked a drive to seek alternative treatments offering superior safety and efficacy profiles. Cannabinoid-based pharmaceuticals, notably cannabidiol (CBD), hold promise in pain management, driven by their natural origins, versatility, and reduced risk of addiction. As we navigate the opioid crisis, ongoing research plunges into CBD's therapeutic potential, buoyed by animal studies revealing its pain-relieving prowess through various system tweaks. However, the efficacy of cannabis in chronic pain management remains a contentious and stigmatized issue. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) presently refrains from endorsing cannabinoid use for pain relief. Nevertheless, evidence indicates their potential in alleviating cancer-related, neuropathic, arthritis, and musculoskeletal pain, necessitating further investigation. Crucially, our comprehension of CBD's role in pain management is a journey still unfolding, with animal studies illustrating its analgesic effects through interactions with the endocannabinoid, inflammatory, and nociceptive systems. As the plot thickens, it's clear: the saga of chronic pain and CBD's potential offers a compelling narrative ripe for further exploration and understanding.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder: hope or hype?",
      "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined as a group of neurodevelopmental disorders whose symptoms include impaired communication and social interaction, restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, and varying levels of intellectual disability. ASD is observed in early childhood and is one of the most severe chronic childhood disorders in prevalence, morbidity, and impact on society. It is usually accompanied by attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and epilepsy. The treatment of ASD has low efficacy, possibly because it has a heterogeneous nature, and its neurobiological basis is not clearly understood. Drugs such as risperidone and aripiprazole are the only two drugs available that are recognized by the Food and Drug Administration, primarily for treating the behavioral symptoms of this disorder. These drugs have limited efficacy and a high potential for inducing undesirable effects, compromising treatment adherence. Therefore, there is great interest in exploring the endocannabinoid system, which modulates the activity of other neurotransmitters, has actions in social behavior and seems to be altered in patients with ASD. Thus, cannabidiol (CBD) emerges as a possible strategy for treating ASD symptoms since it has relevant pharmacological actions on the endocannabinoid system and shows promising results in studies related to disorders in the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is experienced due to injury to the nerves, underlying disease conditions or toxicity induced by chemotherapeutics. Multiple factors can contribute to neuropathic pain such as central nervous system (CNS)-related autoimmune and metabolic disorders, nerve injury, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Hence, development of pharmacological interventions to reduce the drawbacks of existing chemotherapeutics and counter neuropathic pain is an urgent unmet clinical need. Cannabinoid treatment has been reported to be beneficial for several disease conditions including neuropathic pain. Cannabinoids act by inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve endings, modulating the excitation of postsynaptic neurons, activating descending inhibitory pain pathways, reducing neural inflammation and oxidative stress and also correcting autophagy defects. This review provides insights on the various preclinical and clinical therapeutic applications of cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabinol (CBN) in various diseases and the ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of chronic and acute pain with cannabinoids. Pharmacological and genetic experimental strategies have well demonstrated the potential neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids and also elaborated their mechanism of action for the therapy of neuropathic pain.",

Furthermore, the burden of age-related diseases has become a global challenge. It is of great significance to search for drugs to extend lifespan and healthspan. Cannabidiol (CBD), a natural nontoxic phytocannabinoid, has been regarded as a potential candidate drug for antiaging. An increasing number of studies have suggested that CBD could benefit healthy longevity. Herein, we summarized the effect of CBD on aging and analyzed the possible mechanism. All these conclusions may provide a perspective for further study of CBD on aging.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous wounds, both acute and chronic, begin with loss of the integrity, and thus barrier function, of the skin. Surgery and trauma produce acute wounds. There are 22 million surgical procedures per year in the United States alone, based on data from the American College of Surgeons, resulting in a prevalence of 6.67%. Acute traumatic wounds requiring repair total 8 million per year, 2.42% or 24.2 per 1000. The cost of wound care is increasing; it approached USD 100 billion for just Medicare in 2018. This burden for wound care will continue to rise with population aging, the increase in metabolic syndrome, and more elective surgeries. To heal a wound, an orchestrated, evolutionarily conserved, and complex series of events involving cellular and molecular agents at the local and systemic levels are necessary. The principal factors of this important function include elements from the neurological, cardiovascular, immune, nutritional, and endocrine systems. The objectives of this review are to provide clinicians engaged in wound care and basic science researchers interested in wound healing with an updated synopsis from recent publications. We also present data from our primary investigations, testing the hypothesis that cannabidiol can alter cutaneous wound healing and documenting their effects in wild type (C57/BL6) and db/db mice (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, T2DM). The focus is on the potential roles of the endocannabinoid system, cannabidiol, and the important immune-regulatory wound cytokine IL-33, a member of the IL-1 family, and connective tissue growth factor, CTGF, due to their roles in both normal and abnormal wound healing. We found an initial delay in the rate of wound closure in B6 mice with CBD, but this difference disappeared with time. CBD decreased IL-33 + cells in B6 by 70% while nearly increasing CTGF + cells in db/db mice by two folds from 18.6% to 38.8% (",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) can prevent the inflammatory response of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in Caco-2-cells. This action is coupled with the inhibition of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-18, and TNF-alpha, responsible for the inflammatory process during SARS-CoV-2 infection. CBD can act on the different proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 and as an antiviral agent to prevent the viral infection. Furthermore, recent studies have shown the possible action of CBD as an antagonist of cytokine release syndromes. In the SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) seems to be the key cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ interact in an opposite manner in many diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. CBD exerts its activity through the interaction with PPARγ in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, we can hypothesize that CBD may counteract the inflammatory process of SARS-CoV-2 by its interactions with both ACE2 and the interplay between the WNT/β-catenin pathway and PPARγ. Vaccines are the only way to prevent COVID-19, but it appears important to find therapeutic complements to treat patients already affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The possible role of CBD should be investigated by clinical trials to show its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Cannabis-derived compounds, such as cannabidiol (CBD) and delta-9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are increasingly prescribed for a range of clinical indications. These phyto-cannabinoids have multiple biological targets, including the body's endocannabinoid system. There is growing scientific interest in the use of CBD, a non-intoxicating compound, to ameliorate symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, its suitability as a pharmaceutical intervention has not been reliably established in these clinical populations. This systematic review examines the nine published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have probed the safety and efficacy of CBD in individuals diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, Tourette Syndrome, and complex motor disorders. Studies were identified systematically through searching four databases: Medline, CINAHL complete, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. Inclusion criteria were randomised controlled trials involving CBD and participants with neurodevelopmental disorders. No publication year or language restrictions were applied. Relevant data were extracted from the identified list of eligible articles. After extraction, data were cross-checked between the authors to ensure consistency. Several trials indicate potential efficacy, although this possibility is currently too inconsistent across RCTs to confidently guide clinical usage. Study characteristics, treatment properties, and outcomes varied greatly across the included trials. The material lack of comparable RCTs leaves CBD's suitability as a pharmacological treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders largely undetermined. A stronger evidence base is urgently required to establish safety and efficacy profiles and guide the ever-expanding clinical uptake of cannabis-derived compounds in neurodevelopmental disorders.

      "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an integral neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and homeostasis regarding immunity, as well as brain and other physiological functions such as anxiety, pain, metabolic regulation, and bone growth. Cannabis is a plant that contains exogenous cannabinoids, which have the potential for profound interplay within the ECS as enzymatic inhibitors or receptor-mediated interactions. Activation of cannabinoid receptors leads to various intracellular signaling processes that are involved in cellular functions, but those interactions are diverse due to different affinities of each cannabinoid with relevant receptors. Among the exogenous cannabinoids, cannabidiol (CBD) has drawn attention due to its potential anticancer, antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antiseizure properties using in vitro and in vivo models. Although scientific evidence is limited in dogs, there appears to be cautious optimism regarding the utilization of CBD in conjunction with other therapeutics for a range of disorders. This review will primarily focus on current scientific research on the efficacy of CBD on seizure, anxiety, osteoarthritis, and atopic dermatitis, following a brief discussion of endo- and exogenous cannabinoids, ECS, their molecular mechanism, and potential side effects in veterinary medicine. Cannabinoid pharmacology and pharmacokinetics will be addressed in the companion Currents in One Health by Schwark and Wakshlag, AJVR, May 2023.",

      "abstract": "The incidence of chronic pain is around 8% in the general population, and its impact on quality of life, mood, and sleep exceeds the burden of its causal pathology. Chronic pain is a complex and multifaceted problem with few effective and safe treatment options. It can be associated with neurological diseases, peripheral injuries or central trauma, or some maladaptation to traumatic or emotional events. In this perspective, animal models are used to assess the manifestations of neuropathy, such as allodynia and hyperalgesia, through nociceptive tests, such as von Frey, Hargreaves, hot plate, tail-flick, Randall & Selitto, and others. Cannabidiol (CBD) has been considered a promising strategy for treating chronic pain and diseases that have pain as a consequence of neuropathy. However, despite the growing body of evidence linking the efficacy of CBD on pain management in clinical and basic research, there is a lack of reviews focusing on chronic pain assessments, especially when considering pre-clinical studies, which assess chronic pain as a disease by itself or as a consequence of trauma or peripheral or central disease. Therefore, this review focused only on studies that fit our inclusion criteria: (1) used treatment with CBD extract; (2) used tests to assess mechanical or thermal nociception in at least one of the following most commonly used tests (von Frey, hot plate, acetone, Hargreaves, tail-flick, Randall & Selitto, and others); and (3) studies that assessed pain sensitivity in chronic pain induction models. The current literature points out that CBD is a well-tolerated and safe natural compound that exerts analgesic effects, decreasing hyperalgesia, and mechanical/thermal allodynia in several animal models of pain and patients. In addition, CBD presents several molecular and cellular mechanisms of action involved in its positive effects on chronic pain. In conclusion, using CBD seems to be a promising strategy to overcome the lack of efficacy of conventional treatment for chronic pain.",

      "abstract": "Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of the most abundant components of Cannabis and has long been used in Cannabis-based preparations. Recently, CBD has become a promising pharmacological agent because of its beneficial properties in the pathophysiology of several diseases. Although CBD is a kind of cannabinoid and acts on cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), molecular targets involved in diverse therapeutic properties of CBD have not been identified because CBD also interacts with other molecular targets. Considering that CBD alters the intracellular calcium level by which calpain activity is controlled, and both CBD and calpain are associated with various diseases related to calcium signaling, including neurological disorders, this review provides an overview of calpain and calcium signaling as possible molecular targets of CBD. As calpain is known to play an important role in the pathophysiology of neurological disease, a deeper understanding of its relationship with CBD will be meaningful. To understand the role of CBD as a calpain regulator, in silico structural analysis on the binding mode of CBD with calpain was performed.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from endosomes that play a role in cellular communication. These vesicles which mimic the parental cells that release them are promising candidates for targeted drug delivery and therapeutic applications against cancer because of their favorable biocompatibility, specific targeting, low toxicity, and immunogenicity. Currently, Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD) and other cannabinoids (e.g., CBG, THCV, CBC), are being explored for their anticancer and anti-proliferative properties. Several mechanisms, including cell cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, activation of autophagy and apoptosis, inhibition of adhesion, metastasis, and angiogenesis have been proposed for their anticancer activity. EVs could be engineered as cannabinoid delivery systems for tumor-specificity leading to superior anticancer effects. This review discusses current techniques for EV isolation from various sources, characterization and strategies to load them with cannabinoids. More extensively, we culminate information available on different sources of EVs that have anticancer activity, mechanism of action of cannabinoids against various wild type and resistant tumors and role of CBD in histone modifications and cancer epigenetics. We have also enumerated the role of EVs containing cannabinoids against various tumors and in chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain.",

Studies have shown the complexity of epileptogenesis and ictogenesis, in which immunological processes and epigenetic and structural changes in neuronal tissues have been identified as triggering epilepsy. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a major active component of the Cannabis plant and the source of CBD-enriched products for the treatment of epilepsy and associated diseases. In this review, we provide an up-to-date discussion on cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered during epilepsy crises, and the phytochemical characteristics of CBD that make it an attractive candidate for controlling rare syndromes, with excellent therapeutic properties. We also discuss possible CBD anticonvulsant mechanisms and molecular targets in neurodegenerative disorders and epilepsy. Based on these arguments, we conclude that CBD presents a biotecnological potential in the anticonvulsant process, including decreasing dependence on health care in hospitals, and could make the patient's life more stable, with regard to neurological conditions.",

Cannabidiol has attracted growing attention in the cosmetic industry, with an increasing number of CBD-containing skincare products on the market in recent years. The aim of this review is to evaluate the current evidence on the use of CBD for cosmetic purposes. Following an overview of CBD and the endocannabinoid system in the skin, we summarize pre-clinical and clinical studies that address the potential of CBD in cosmetic dermatology. Available in vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that CBD has anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, moisturizing, anti-acne, wound-healing, and anti-aging properties. However, only a few clinical studies have been conducted on the use of CBD in the skin. In addition, there is a critical need to develop an efficient drug-delivery system for topical/transdermal application of CBD. Further research, including clinical and pharmacokinetic studies, are needed to fully evaluate the role of CBD in cosmetic dermatology.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we explored the growing interest in cannabinoids, particularly cannabidiol (CBD), over the last two decades due to their potential therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. CBD, a major non-psychotomimetic compound derived from Cannabis sativa, is highlighted as a safer alternative to other cannabinoids like Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Clinical trials have been investigating CBD formulations for conditions such as schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases, and stress-related disorders. However, limited access to CBD-approved formulations primarily due to their high-cost and concerns about the quality of market-available products, challenges regulatory agencies globally. The pharmacokinetics of CBD, especially after oral administration, present challenges with erratic absorption and low bioavailability. CBD's \"promiscuous\" pharmacodynamics involve interactions with various targets beyond the endocannabinoid system, complicating precise dosing in therapeutic interventions. This chapter delves into CBD's dose-response curves, revealing complexities that pose challenges in clinical practice. Nanobiotechnology emerges as a promising solution, with recent developments showing improved bioavailability, stability, and reduced toxicity through nanoencapsulation of CBD. While this phytocannabinoid holds immense promise in neuropsychopharmacology, we provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of CBD research and suggests potential future directions regarding the pharmacology of CBD, harnessing the benefits of this intriguing compound.",

The country will only fully benefit from this development if the medical and scientific community can take the lead in enabling the country to exploit the plant's potential to help address some of our economic and public health challenges. This special communication provides some basic information on cannabis and discusses its history and medical uses. Cannabidiol (CBD) has emerged as one of the most important cannabis-derived phytochemicals and has formed the basis for the growth of the medical cannabis industry. The scientific data on the mechanisms of the effects of CBD on the human neuroendocrine-immune network is reviewed and the first effective cannabis-based FDA-approved treatment for epilepsy discussed. Some clinical research that is being done on the antipsychotic and neuroprotective properties of CBD is also reviewed. A case is made for the potential of CBD as a neuroprotective adjunctive therapy for the prevention of neuropsychological sequelae associated with complicated malaria. The safety profile of CBD is reviewed and finally, the potential importance of the re-medicalization of cannabis-based therapies for the broader field of phytomedicine is pointed out.",

Crucial to realizing this potential is the ability to manufacture high-quality exosomes; however, unlike biologics such as proteins, exosomes lack standardized Good Manufacturing Practices for their processing and characterization. Furthermore, there is a lack of well-characterized reference exosome materials to aid in selection of methods for exosome isolation, purification, and analysis. This review informs exosome research and technology development by comparing exosome processing and characterization methods and recommending exosome workflows. This review also provides a detailed introduction to exosomes, including their physical and chemical properties, roles in normal biological processes and in disease progression, and summarizes some of the on-going clinical trials.",

Exosome is the nanoscale membrane-bound extracellular vesicle that plays significant roles in intercellular communications by carrying bioactive molecules, e.g., proteins, RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), DNAs, from one cell to the others. In this review, we provide the update information on the crosstalk between exosome and inflammasome and their roles in inflammatory responses. The effects of inflammasome activation on exosomal secretion are summarized. On the other hand, the (dual) effects of exosomes on inhibiting and promoting inflammasome activation are discussed. Finally, perspectives on therapeutic roles of exosomes in human diseases and future direction of the research on exosome-inflammasome crosstalk are provided.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are a subtype of membrane-contained vesicles 40-200 nm in diameter that are secreted by cells into their surroundings. By transporting proteins, lipids, mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and DNA, exosomes are able to perform such vital functions as maintaining cellular homeostasis, removing cellular debris, and facilitating intercellular and interorgan communication. Exosomes travel in all body fluids and deliver their molecular messages in autocrine, paracrine as well as endocrine manners. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in studying exosomes as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, since in many disease conditions this machinery becomes dysregulated or hijacked by pathological processes. Additionally, delivery of exosomes and exosomal miRNA has already been shown to improve systemic metabolism and inhibit progression of cancer development in mice. However, the subcellular machinery of exosomes, including their biogenesis, release and uptake, remains largely unknown. This review will bring molecular details of these processes up to date with the goal of expanding the knowledge basis for designing impactful exosome experiments in the future.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicles, produced within multivesicular bodies, that are then released into the extracellular space through a merging of the multivesicular body with the plasma membrane. These vesicles are secreted by almost all cell types to aid in a vast array of cellular functions, including intercellular communication, cell differentiation and proliferation, angiogenesis, stress response, and immune signaling. This ability to contribute to several distinct processes is due to the complexity of exosomes, as they carry a multitude of signaling moieties, including proteins, lipids, cell surface receptors, enzymes, cytokines, transcription factors, and nucleic acids. The favorable biological properties of exosomes including biocompatibility, stability, low toxicity, and proficient exchange of molecular cargos make exosomes prime candidates for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Exploring the functions and molecular payloads of exosomes can facilitate tissue regeneration therapies and provide mechanistic insight into paracrine modulation of cellular activities. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of exosome biogenesis, composition, and isolation methods. We also discuss emerging healing properties of exosomes and exosomal cargos, such as microRNAs, in brain injuries, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 amongst others. Overall, this review highlights the burgeoning roles and potential applications of exosomes in regenerative medicine.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a type of regulatory non-coding RNA, are often incorporated into exosomes as signaling molecules. In this review, we discuss the expression of exosomal miRNAs from diverse origins such as tumor cells, solid tumor tissue, and biological fluids in various cancers (lung, breast, colorectal, liver, stomach, and pancreatic). We address the biological functions of exosome-derived miRNAs in processes such as tumor-cell proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance in the tumor microenvironment. In particular, we discuss three oncogenic miRNAs, miR-21, miR-141, and miR-451, which occur within exosomes, in terms of gene regulation and intercellular communication. We consider therapeutic miRNA-based nanoparticles, which are widely expressed in tumors and show promise in drug therapy. The review assesses the wide-ranging evidence for using exosomal miRNAs as tumor markers in molecular diagnosis. Further, we consider the use of nanoparticle platforms to transport miRNAs, in the targeted treatment of disease and tumors.",

      "abstract": "Exosomal circRNA serves a novel genetic information molecule, facilitating communication between tumor cells and microenvironmental cells, such as immune cells, fibroblasts, and other components, thereby regulating critical aspects of cancer progression including immune escape, tumor angiogenesis, metabolism, drug resistance, proliferation and metastasis. Interestingly, microenvironment cells have new findings in influencing tumor progression and immune escape mediated by the release of exosomal circRNA. Given the intrinsic stability, abundance, and broad distribution of exosomal circRNAs, they represent excellent diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for liquid biopsy. Moreover, artificially synthesized circRNAs may open up new possibilities for cancer therapy, potentially bolstered by nanoparticles or plant exosome delivery strategies. In this review, we summarize the functions and underlying mechanisms of tumor cell and non-tumor cell-derived exosomal circRNAs in cancer progression, with a special focus on their roles in tumor immunity and metabolism. Finally, we examine the potential application of exosomal circRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, highlighting their promise for clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes have a crucial role in intercellular communication and mediate interactions between tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Exosome-encapsulated non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in various physiological processes. Tumor-derived exosomal ncRNAs induce M2 macrophage polarization through signaling pathway activation, signal transduction, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Conversely, TAM-derived exosomal ncRNAs promote tumor proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and immunosuppression. MicroRNAs induce gene silencing by directly targeting mRNAs, whereas lncRNAs and circRNAs act as miRNA sponges to indirectly regulate protein expressions. The role of ncRNAs in tumor-host interactions is ubiquitous. Current research is increasingly focused on the tumor microenvironment. On the basis of the \"cancer-immunity cycle\" hypothesis, we discuss the effects of exosomal ncRNAs on immune cells to induce T cell exhaustion, overexpression of programmed cell death ligands, and create a tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Furthermore, we discuss potential applications and prospects of exosomal ncRNAs as clinical biomarkers and drug delivery systems.",

      "title": "Advances in Exosome-Based Drug Delivery and Tumor Targeting: From Tissue Distribution to Intracellular Fate.",
      "abstract": "Exosomes or small extracellular vesicles are considered a new generation of bioinspired-nanoscale drug delivery system (DDS). Endogenous exosomes function as signalosomes since they convey signals via ligands or adhesion molecules located on the exosomal membrane, or packaged inside the exosome. Recently, exosome membrane modification, therapeutic payloads encapsulation, and modulation of in vivo disposition of exosomes have been extensively investigated, among which significant advances have been made to optimize exosome-mediated delivery to solid tumors. Exosomes, specifically tumor cell-derived exosomes, are presumed to have tumor-preferential delivery due to the homotypic features. However, quality attributes that dictate the tissue distribution, cell type-selective uptake, and intracellular payload release of the administered exosomes, as well as the spatiotemporal information regarding exosome fate in vivo, remain to be further investigated. This review summarizes recent advances in developing exosomes as drug delivery platforms with a focus on tumor targeting. The pharmacokinetic features of naive exosomes and factors influencing their intracellular fate are summarized. Recent strategies to improve tumor targeting of exosomes are also reviewed in the context of the biological features of tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME). Selected approaches to augment tumor tissue deposition of exosomes, as well as methods to enhance intracellular payload delivery, are summarized with emphasis on the underlying mechanisms (eg, passive or active targeting, endosomal escape, etc.). In conclusion, this review highlights recently reported tumor-targeting strategies of exosome-based drug delivery, and it's in the hope that multiple approaches might be employed in a synergistic combination in the development of exosome-based cancer therapy.",

Surface modification of exosomes imparts additional functionality to the exosomes to enable site specific drug delivery and in vivo imaging and tracking and is an emerging area in drug delivery research. The present review focuses upon these modifications on the exosomal surface, the chemistry involved and their impact on targeted drug delivery for the treatment of brain, breast, lung, liver, colon tumors and, heart diseases and for understanding their in vivo fate including their uptake mechanisms, pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The specific exosomal membrane proteins such as tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, CD9), lactadherin (LA), lysosome associated membrane protein-2b (Lamp-2b) and, glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) involved in functionalization of exosome surface have also been discussed along with different strategies of surface modification like genetic engineering, covalent modification (click chemistry and metabolic engineering of parent cells of exosomes) and non-covalent modification (multivalent electrostatic interactions, ligand-receptor interaction, hydrophobic interaction, aptamer based modification and modification by anchoring CP05 peptide) along with optical (fluorescent and bioluminescent) and radioactive isotope labelling techniques of exosomes for imaging purpose.",

      "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic modifications play pivotal roles in regulating RNA stability, localization and function. Recently, glycosylation has also emerged as an RNA modification, though its functional implications remain unclear. Here we report that metabolic labelling with a N-azidoacetylgalactosamine-tetraacylated bioorthogonal probe in mammalian cells reveals small, non-coding, glyco-modified RNAs (glycoRNAs) that exhibit unusual stability imparted by their resistance to RNases. These glycoRNAs are primarily found within exosome vesicles as intraluminal cargo, distinct from recently reported cell surface glycoRNAs. Importantly, exosomal glycoRNAs can be transferred to naive cells, highlighting a role in intercellular RNA communication. The inhibition of exosome biogenesis leads to intracellular glycoRNA accumulation, while blocking glycan transfer to proteins reduces glycoRNA sorting into exosomes. These findings suggest a regulatory link between protein and RNA glycosylation in exosome cargo selection. Our studies support a functional role for glycosylation in targeting RNA into exosomes and uncover potential avenues for exosome-based diagnostics and RNA therapeutic applications.",

It has been shown that exosomal miRNAs (exo-miRNAs) are implicated in a variety of cellular processes including (but not limited to) cell migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and autophagy. Exosomes can play a role in cardiovascular diseases and can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for several diseases, especially cancer. Tremendous advances in technology have led to the development of various platforms for miRNA profiling. Each platform has its own limitations and strengths that need to be understood in order to use them properly. In the current review, we summarize some exo-miRNAs that are relevant to exo-miRNA profiling studies and describe new methods used for the measurement of miRNA profiles in different human bodily fluids.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe mental disorder that affects approximately 1% general population worldwide and poses a considerable burden to society. Despite decades of research, its etiology remains unclear, and diagnosis remains challenging due to its heterogeneous symptoms. Exosomes play a crucial role in intercellular communication, and their contents, including nucleotides, proteins and metabolites, have been linked to various diseases. Recent studies have implicated exosome abnormalities in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the relationship between exosomes and schizophrenia, focusing on the role of exosomal contents in this disease. We summarize recent findings and provide insights into the potential use of exosomes as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia.",

They are responsible for inter- and intracellular communications and their role in drug delivery is well defined. Exosomes have great potential for therapeutic applications, but the clinical use is restricted because of limitations in standardized procedures for isolation, purification, and drug delivery. Bioengineering of exosomes could be one approach to achieve standardization and reproducible isolation for clinical use. Exosomes are important transporters for targeted drug delivery because of their small size, stable structure, non-immunogenicity, and non-toxic nature, as well as their ability to carry a wide variety of compounds. These features of exosomes can be enhanced further by bioengineering. In this review, possible exosome bioengineering approaches, their biomedical applications, and targeted drug delivery are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes, which are extracellular vesicles (EVs) predominantly present in bodily fluids, participate in various physiological processes. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation mechanism, eliminates proteins and damaged organelles by forming double-membrane autophagosomes. These autophagosomes subsequently merge with lysosomes for target degradation. The interaction between autophagy and endosomal/exosomal pathways can occur at different stages, exerting significant influences on normal physiology and human diseases. The interplay between exosomes and the autophagy pathway is intricate. Exosomes exhibit a cytoprotective role by inducing intracellular autophagy, while autophagy modulates the biogenesis and degradation of exosomes. Research indicates that exosomes and autophagy contribute to the infection process of numerous enveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses, comprising viral nucleic acid, proteins, or virions, can be encapsulated within exosomes and transferred between cells via exosomal transport. Consequently, exosomes play a crucial role in the infection of certain viral diseases. This review presents recent findings on the interplay between exosomes and autophagy, as well as their implications in the infection of enveloped viruses, thereby offering valuable insights into the pathogenesis and vaccine research of enveloped virus infection.",

Affecting 4-6 % of pregnancies globally, PE remains a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity. While its precise etiology is not fully understood, growing evidence implicates extracellular vesicles-particularly exosomes-in its pathogenesis. These nanoscale vesicles facilitate intercellular communication by transporting bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs. In PE, placental exosomes show altered profiles that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, immune imbalance, and impaired angiogenesis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on exosome biogenesis, their diagnostic utility-especially exosomal ncRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers-and emerging therapeutic strategies, including engineered exosomes for targeted delivery.

Exosomal miRNAs modulate processes that interfere with cancer immunity and microenvironment, and are significantly involved in tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis and drug resistance. Fully investigating the detailed mechanism of miRNAs in the occurrence and development of various cancers could help not only in the treatment of cancers but also in the prevention of malignant diseases. The current review highlighted recently published advances regarding cancer-derived exosomes, e.g., sorting and delivery mechanisms for RNAs. Exosomal miRNAs that modulate cancer cell-to-cell communication, impacting tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis and multiple biological features, were discussed. Finally, the potential role of exosomal miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic molecular markers was summarized, as well as their usefulness in detecting cancer resistance to therapeutic agents.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes, bilaterally phospholipid-coated small vesicles, are produced and released by nearly all cells, which comprise diverse biological macromolecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and others, that participate in the regulation of their biological functions. An increasing number of studies have revealed that the contents of exosomes, particularly microRNA(miRNA), play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including autoimmune skin diseases. MiRNA is a class of single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules that possess approximately 22 nucleotides in length with the capability of binding to the untranslated as well as coding regions of target mRNA to regulate gene expression precisely at the post-transcriptional level. Various exosomal miRNAs have been found to be significantly expressed in some autoimmune skin diseases and involved in the pathogenesis of conditions via regulating the secretion of crucial pathogenic cytokines and the direction of immune cell differentiation. Thus, exosomal miRNAs might be promising biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, relapse and reflection to treatment based on their functions and changes. This review summarized the current studies on exosomal miRNAs in several common autoimmune skin diseases, aiming to dissect the underlying mechanism from a new perspective, seek novel biomarkers for disease monitoring and lay the foundation for developing innovative target therapy in the future.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are small vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm that are produced by many, if not all, cell types. Exosome cargo includes lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids arranged specifically in the endosomes of donor cells. Exosomes can transfer the donor cell components to target cells and can affect cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. Important new information about exosomes' remote communication with other cells is rapidly being accumulated. Recent data indicates that the results of this communication depend on the donor cell type and the environment of the host cell. In the field of cancer research, major questions remain, such as whether tumor cell exosomes are equally taken up by cancer cells and normal cells and whether exosomes secreted by normal cells are specifically taken up by other normal cells or also tumor cells. Furthermore, we do not know how exosome uptake is made selective, how we can trace exosome uptake selectivity, or what the most appropriate methods are to study exosome uptake and selectivity. This review will explain the effect of exosome source and the impact of the donor cell growth environment on tumor and normal cell interaction and communication. The review will also summarize the methods that have been used to label and trace exosomes to date.",

      "abstract": "Exosomes are responsible for cell-to-cell communication and serves as a valuable drug delivery vehicle. However, exosome heterogeneity, non-standardized isolation methods and proteomics/bioinformatics approaches limit its clinical applications. To better understand exosome heterogeneity, biological function and molecular mechanism of its biogenesis, secretion and uptake, techniques in proteomics or bioinformatics were applied to investigate human embryonic kidney cell (293T cell line)-derived exosome proteome and enable an integrative comparison of exosomal proteins and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of eleven exosome proteomes extracted from diverse human samples, including 293T (two datasets), dermal fibroblast, mesenchymal stem cell, thymic epithelial primary cell, breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), patient neuroblastoma cell, plasma, saliva, serum and urine. Mapping of exosome biogenesis/secretion/uptake-related proteins onto exosome proteomes highlights exosomal origin-specific routes of exosome biogenesis/secretion/uptake and exosome-dependent intercellular communication. The finding provides insight into comparative exosome proteomes and its biogenesis, secretion and uptake, and potentially contributes to clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment, with its complex immune evasion mechanisms, significantly hinders the efficacy of anti-tumor immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Consequently, there is a strong impetus for extensive research to elucidate the immunosuppressive mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment and to develop novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we have developed a drug/gene delivery system (folate-modified GW4869-loaded siIRF3 nano-complex, FD9R-GW/siIRF3) designed to simultaneously target and inhibit two key immune evasion pathways in the tumor microenvironment. The folate receptor-mediated delivery of GW4869 to cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) led to the suppression of biosynthesis and release of tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) containing exosomal PD-L1. Furthermore, IRF3 gene silencing effectively inhibited the M2-type differentiation of TAMs, and suppressed the secretion of CC motif chemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) in cancer cells, consequently reducing the recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs). The efficacy of FD9R-GW/siIRF3 in impeding tumor immune evasion was substantiated by an augmented recruitment of cytotoxic T cells and a diminished M2 macrophage polarization in the folate receptor-expressing 4 T1 allograft breast cancer model. Furthermore, the combination of a-PD-1 immunotherapy with FD9R-GW/siIRF3 led to a significant enhancement in the antitumor immune response, as evidenced by the inhibition of circulating tumor-derived exosomal PD-L1.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and recurrent spontaneous abortion are common maternal pregnancy complications that seriously endanger women's lives and health, and their occurrence is increasing year after year with a rejuvenation trend. In contrast to biomarkers found freely in tissues or body fluids, exosomes exist in a relatively independent environment and provide a higher level of stability. As backbone molecules, guidance molecules, and signaling molecules in the nucleus, lncRNAs can regulate gene expression. In the cytoplasm, lncRNAs can influence gene expression levels by modifying mRNA stability, acting as competitive endogenous RNAs to bind miRNAs, and so on. Exosomal lncRNAs can exist indefinitely and are important in intercellular communication and signal transduction. Changes in maternal serum exosome lncRNA expression can accurately and timely reflect the progression and regression of pregnancy-related diseases. The purpose of this paper is to provide a reference for clinical research on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment methods of pregnancy-related diseases by reviewing the role of exosome lncRNAs in female pathological pregnancy and related molecular mechanisms.",

Therefore, the isolation and separation of exosomes is particularly important for the research and application of exosomes. This paper aims to review the research progress of exosome isolation and separation methods in recent years, including ultracentrifugation, ultrafiltration, size‑exclusion chromatography, precipitation, immunomagnetic bead capture method, aptamer-based isolation, and isolation methods based on microfluidic technology. It is generally accepted that most of the existing methods have limitations, for example, ultracentrifugation is time-consuming and laborious, and immunomagnetic bead capture method and aptamer-based separation method have small sample processing capacity and high cost. As a result, we also introduce some common situations in which two or more methods are combined for use. Finally, the separation and isolation methods including all those presented in this review were compared and summarized.",

Numerous studies have confirmed that exosomes are involved in various stages of the occurrence and development of gastric cancer and play an important role. With the gradual development, exosomes have been widely employed in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. In this review, we have provided a basic overview of exosome, and discussed the role of exosome in the occurrence, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance in gastric cancer. In addition, we have emphasized the bright development prospect of exosome in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. The data on the discovery, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of gastric cancer are not particularly optimistic, but the discovery of exosome, applied in diagnosis and treatment, provides a new and effective way to improve the survival rate of patients with gastric cancer.",

      "abstract": "Exosome therapy holds great promise as a novel approach to improve acute skin wound healing. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of exosome biology and its potential applications in acute skin wound healing and beyond. Exosomes, small extracellular vesicles secreted by various stem cells, have emerged as potent mediators of intercellular communication and tissue repair. One advantage of exosome therapy is its ability to avoid potential risks associated with stem cell therapy, such as immune rejection or stem cells differentiating into unwanted cell types. However, further research is necessary to optimize exosome therapy, not only in the areas of exosome isolation, characterization, and engineering, but also in determining the optimal dose, timing, administration, and frequency of exosome therapy. Thus, optimization of exosome therapy is critical for the development of more effective and safer exosome-based therapies for acute skin wound healing and other diseases induced by cancer, ischemia, or inflammation. This review provides valuable insights into the potential of exosome therapy and highlights the need for further research to optimize exosome therapy for clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) may cause severe hepatic impairment, acute hepatic insufficiency, and multiorgan system collapse. Exosomes can alleviate HIRI. Therefore, this study explored the role of exosomal-related genes (ERGs) in HIRI using bioinformatics to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms and novel diagnostic markers for HIRI. We merged the GSE12720, GSE14951, and GSE15480 datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database into a combined gene dataset (CGD). CGD was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on a comparison of the HIRI and healthy control cohorts. The impact of these DEGs on HIRI was assessed through gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA). ERGs were retrieved from the GeneCards database and prior studies, and overlapped with the identified DEGs to yield the set of exosome-related differentially expressed genes (ERDEGs). Functional annotations and enrichment pathways of these genes were determined using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Diagnostic models for HIRI were developed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Key genes with diagnostic value were identified from the overlap, and single-sample gene-set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was conducted to evaluate the immune infiltration characteristics. A molecular regulatory interaction network was established using Cytoscape software to elucidate the intricate regulatory mechanisms of key genes in HIRI. Finally, exosome score (Es) was obtained using ssGSEA and the HIRI group was divided into the Es_High and Es_Low groups based on the median Es. Gene expression was analyzed to understand the impact of all genes in the CGD on HIRI. Finally, the relative expression levels of the five key genes in the hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) model were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A total of 3810 DEGs were identified through differential expression analysis of the CGD, and 61 of these ERDEGs were screened. Based on GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, the ERDEGs were mainly enriched in wound healing, MAPK, protein kinase B signaling, and other pathways. GSEA and GSVA revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in the TP53, MAPK, TGF[Formula: see text], JAK-STAT, MAPK, and NFKB pathways. Five key genes (ANXA1, HNRNPA2B1, ICAM1, PTEN, and THBS1) with diagnostic value were screened using the LASSO regression and SVM algorithms and their molecular interaction network was established using Cytoscape software. Based on ssGSEA, substantial variations were found in the expression of 18 immune cell types among the groups (p < 0.05). Finally, the Es of each HIRI patient was calculated. ERDEGs in the Es_High and Es_Low groups were enriched in the IL18, TP53, MAPK, TGF[Formula: see text], and JAK-STAT pathways. The differential expression of these five key genes in the H/R model was verified using qRT-PCR. Herein, five key genes were identified as potential diagnostic markers. Moreover, the potential impact of these genes on pathways and the regulatory mechanisms of their interaction network in HIRI were revealed. Altogether, our findings may serve as a theoretical foundation for enhancing clinical diagnosis and elucidating underlying pathogeneses.",

Moreover, exosomes contain several functional molecules, including ncRNAs. NcRNAs function as master regulators to coordinate cell growth, cell motility and drug resistance. However, intracellular ncRNAs, which can be transferred to recipient cells via exosomes (exosomal ncRNAs), mediate common/distinct downstream molecules, signaling pathways and functions that are less emphasized concepts in cancer development research.

Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers in women. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles (EVs) with an average size of about 100 nm that contain lipids, proteins, microRNAs (miRNAs), and genetic factors and play a significant role in cell signaling, communication, tumorigenesis, and drug resistance. miRNAs are RNAs with about 22 nucleotides, which are synthesized by RNA polymerase and are involved in regulating gene expression, as well as the prevention or progression of cancer. Many studies have indicated the connection between miRNAs and exosomes. According to their findings, it seems that circulating exosomal miRNAs have not been well evaluated as biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis or monitoring. Therefore, given the importance of miRNAs in exosomes, the goal of the present study was to clarify the relationship between miRNAs in exosomes and the role they play as biomarkers in breast cancer.",

This work overviews the role of exosomes in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, followed by a survey on emerging exosome technologies, particularly microfluidic advances for the isolation and detection of exosomes in cancer research. The advantages and drawbacks of each of the technologies used for the isolation, detection and engineering of exosomes are evaluated to address their clinical challenges for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Furthermore, commercial platforms for exosomal detection and analysis are introduced, and their performance and impact on cancer diagnosis and prognosis are assessed.

      "title": "Can Soluble Immune Checkpoint Molecules on Exosomes Mediate Inflammation?",
      "abstract": "Immune checkpoints (ICPs) are major co-signaling pathways that trigger effector functions in immune cells, with isoforms that are either membrane bound, engaging in direct cell to cell activation locally, or soluble, acting at distant sites by circulating freely or potentially via extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes are small EVs secreted by a variety of cells carrying various proteins and nucleic acids. They are distributed extensively through biological fluids and have major impacts on infectious diseases, cancer, and neuroinflammation. Similarly, ICPs play key roles in a variety of disease conditions and have been extensively utilized as a prognostic tool for various cancers. Herein, we explored if the association between exosomes and ICPs could be a significant contributor of inflammation, particularly in the setting of cancer, neuroinflammation and viral infections, wherein the up regulation in both exosomal proteins and ICPs correlate with immunosuppressive effects. The detailed literature review of existing data highlights the significance and complexity of these two important pathways in mediating cancer and potentiating neuroinflammation via modulating overall immune response. Cells increasingly secret exosomes in response to intracellular signals from invading pathogens or cancerous transformations. These exosomes can carry a variety of cargo including proteins, nucleic acids, cytokines, and receptors/ligands that have functional consequences on recipient cells.

Tumor cell‑derived exosomes carry a large number of integrins, which are closely associated with tumor progression. As crucial mediators of intercellular communication, exosomal integrins have gained attention in the field of cancer biology. The present review examined the regulatory mechanisms of exosomal integrins in tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and emphasized their notable roles in tumor initiation and progression. The potential of exosomal integrins as drug delivery systems in cancer treatment was explored. Additionally, the potential of exosomal integrins in clinical tumor prediction was considered, while summarizing their applications in diagnosis, prognosis assessment and treatment response prediction. Thus, the present review aimed to provide guidance and insights for future basic research and the clinical translation of exosomal integrins. The study of exosomal integrins is poised to offer new perspectives and methods for precise cancer treatment and clinical prediction.",

      "abstract": "Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), the most frequent extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease (GD), can lead to a significant decline in the quality of life in patients. Exosomes, which contain proteins, lipids and DNA, play important roles in the pathological processes of various diseases. However, their roles in Graves' ophthalmopathy are still unclear. We aimed to isolate exosomes and analyze the different exosomal proteins. Tear fluids were collected from twenty-four GO patients, twenty-four GD patients and sixteen control subjects. The numbers of tear exosomes were assayed using nanoparticle tracking analysis. A Luminex 200 kit and ELISA kit were used to confirm the different cytokine concentrations in serum. Extraocular muscle from GO patients and controls was extracted, and western blotting was used to assay the levels of Caspase-3 and complement C4A. Our study demonstrated that the number of tear exosomes differ from GD patients and control. The expression levels of cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, were significantly increased in the tear exosomes and serum from GO patients compared with GD patients and controls. The levels of the exosomal proteins Caspase-3, complement C4A and APOA-IV were significantly increased in GO patients compared to GD patients and controls. Orbital fibroblasts from GO patients showed significantly higher levels of Caspase-3 and complement C4A than those from controls. The levels of serum APOA-IV in GO patients were significantly higher than those in GD patients and controls. Specific proteins showed elevated expression in tear exosomes from GO patients, indicating that they may play important roles in GO pathogenesis.",

For exosome-related research, a rapid, simple, high-purity, and recovery isolation method is the primary prerequisite for exosomal large-scale application in medical practice.

      "abstract": "Exosomes, a subtype of extracellular vesicle secreted by cells, have been a subject of intense research interest. Unfortunately, a simple and reliable method to separate exosomes has yet to be developed. As can be expected, the lack of a standardized method for extraction and purification has contributed to suboptimal inter-laboratory correlation and difficulty in comparison studies. Traditional techniques such as centrifugation, immunoaffinity and size exclusion chromatography, suffer from low purity and tend to be labor intensive thus making their use limited. To mitigate these drawbacks, an integrated biosensor-based exosome separation and detection has recently been developed. In this review, we examine five biosensors that use a variety of detection technology (colorimetric, fluorescent, surface plasmon resonance, surface-enhanced Raman scattering and electrochemical) and propose thoughts on standardization of exosomal analysis.",

Targeting the processes of lipid metabolism, including lipogenesis, lipid uptake, fatty acid oxidation, and lipolysis, is an optimal strategy for anti-cancer therapy. Beyond cell-cell membrane surface interaction, exosomes are pivotal factors that transduce intercellular signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Most research focuses on the role of lipid metabolism in regulating exosome biogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The mechanisms of exosome and ECM-mediated reprogramming of lipid metabolism are currently unclear. We summarize several mechanisms associated with the regulation of lipid metabolism in cancer, including transport of exosomal carriers and membrane receptors, activation of the PI3K pathway, ECM ligand-receptor interactions, and mechanical stimulation. This review aims to highlight the significance of these intercellular factors in TME and to deepen the understanding of the functions of exosomes and ECM in the regulation of lipid metabolism.",

      "abstract": "The cleavage of zygotes generates totipotent blastomeres. In human 8-cell blastomeres, zygotic genome activation (ZGA) occurs to initiate the ontogenesis program. However, capturing and maintaining totipotency in human cells pose significant challenges. Here, we realize culturing human totipotent blastomere-like cells (hTBLCs). We find that splicing inhibition can transiently reprogram human pluripotent stem cells into ZGA-like cells (ZLCs), which subsequently transition into stable hTBLCs after long-term passaging. Distinct from reported 8-cell-like cells (8CLCs), both ZLCs and hTBLCs widely silence pluripotent genes. Interestingly, ZLCs activate a particular group of ZGA-specific genes, and hTBLCs are enriched with pre-ZGA-specific genes. During spontaneous differentiation, hTBLCs re-enter the intermediate ZLC stage and further generate epiblast (EPI)-, primitive endoderm (PrE)-, and trophectoderm (TE)-like lineages, effectively recapitulating human pre-implantation development. Possessing both embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potency, hTBLCs can autonomously generate blastocyst-like structures in vitro without external cell signaling. In summary, our study provides key criteria and insights into human cell totipotency.",

      "abstract": "Since establishment of the first embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in vitro culture of totipotent cells functionally and molecularly comparable with in vivo blastomeres with embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential has been a challenge. Here we report that spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs drives a pluripotent-to-totipotent state transition. Using the splicing inhibitor pladienolide B, we achieve stable in vitro culture of totipotent ESCs comparable at molecular levels with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, which we call totipotent blastomere-like cells (TBLCs). Mouse chimeric assays combined with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrate that TBLCs have a robust bidirectional developmental capability to generate multiple embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages. Mechanically, spliceosomal repression causes widespread splicing inhibition of pluripotent genes, whereas totipotent genes, which contain few short introns, are efficiently spliced and transcriptionally activated. Our study provides a means for capturing and maintaining totipotent stem cells.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is a complex biological process that plays a significant role in various brain disorders. Microglia and astrocytes are the key cell types involved in inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Neuroinflammation results in increased levels of secreted inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species. To model neuroinflammation in vitro, various human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based models have been utilized, including monocultures, transfer of conditioned media between cell types, co-culturing multiple cell types, neural organoids, and xenotransplantation of cells into the mouse brain. To induce neuroinflammatory responses in vitro, several stimuli have been established that can induce responses in either microglia, astrocytes, or both. Here, we describe and critically evaluate the different types of iPSC models that can be used to study neuroinflammation and highlight how neuroinflammation has been induced and measured in these cultures.",

      "abstract": "Organoids, self-organizing three-dimensional (3D) structures derived from stem cells, offer unique advantages for studying organ development, modeling diseases, and screening potential therapeutics. However, their translational potential and ability to mimic complex in vivo functions are often hindered by the lack of an integrated vascular network. To address this critical limitation, bioengineering strategies are rapidly advancing to enable efficient vascularization of organoids. These methods encompass co-culturing organoids with various vascular cell types, co-culturing lineage-specific organoids with vascular organoids, co-differentiating stem cells into organ-specific and vascular lineages, using organoid-on-a-chip technology to integrate perfusable vasculature within organoids, and using 3D bioprinting to also create perfusable organoids. This review explores the field of organoid vascularization, examining the biological principles that inform bioengineering approaches. Additionally, this review envisions how the converging disciplines of stem cell biology, biomaterials, and advanced fabrication technologies will propel the creation of increasingly sophisticated organoid models, ultimately accelerating biomedical discoveries and innovations.",

      "abstract": "Cellular agriculture is an emerging scientific discipline that leverages the existing principles behind stem cell biology, tissue engineering, and animal sciences to create agricultural products from cells in vitro. Cultivated meat, also known as clean meat or cultured meat, is a prominent subfield of cellular agriculture that possesses promising potential to alleviate the negative externalities associated with conventional meat production by producing meat in vitro instead of from slaughter. A core consideration when producing cultivated meat is cell sourcing. Specifically, developing livestock cell sources that possess the necessary proliferative capacity and differentiation potential for cultivated meat production is a key technical component that must be optimized to enable scale-up for commercial production of cultivated meat. There are several possible approaches to develop cell sources for cultivated meat production, each possessing certain advantages and disadvantages. This review will discuss the current cell sources used for cultivated meat production and remaining challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scale-up of cultivated meat for commercial production. We will also discuss cell-focused considerations in other components of the cultivated meat production workflow, namely, culture medium composition, bioreactor expansion, and biomaterial tissue scaffolding.",

      "abstract": "A type of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models which is simple and easy is hanging drop method. The hanging drop method emerges as a pivotal technique with diverse applications in cancer research and cell biology. This method facilitates the formation of multicellular spheroids, providing a unique environment for studying cell behavior dynamics. The hanging drop method's theoretical underpinning relies on gravity-enforced self-assembly, allowing for cost-effective, reproducible 3D cell cultures with controlled spheroid sizes. The advantages of this approach include its efficiency in producing cellular heterogeneity, particularly in non-adherent 3D cultures, and its ability to create hypoxic spheroids, making it a suitable model for studying cancer. Moreover, the hanging drop method has proven valuable in investigating various aspects such as tissue structure, signaling pathways, immune activation of cancer cells, and notably, cell proliferation. Researchers have utilized the hanging drop method to explore the dynamics of cell proliferation, studying the effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) secretome on cancer cells. The method's application involves co-culturing different cell lines, assessing spheroid formations, and quantifying their sizes over time. These studies have unveiled intricate cell behavior dynamics, demonstrating how the MSC secretome influences cancer cell growth and viability within a three-dimensional co-culture paradigm.",

      "abstract": "Stem cells reside in specialized niches that are critical for their function. Upon activation, hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) exit their niche to generate the outer root sheath (ORS), but a subset of ORS progeny returns to the niche to resume an SC state. Mechanisms of this fate reversibility are unclear. We show that the ability of ORS cells to return to the SC state requires suppression of a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation and glutamine metabolism that occurs during early HFSC lineage progression. HFSC fate reversibility and glutamine metabolism are regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2)-Akt signaling axis within the niche. Deletion of mTORC2 results in a failure to re-establish the HFSC niche, defective hair follicle regeneration, and compromised long-term maintenance of HFSCs. These findings highlight the importance of spatiotemporal control of SC metabolic states in organ homeostasis.",

The current treatment regimen is H. pylori eradication, yet evidence is lacking that this treatment is effective on later stages of AG especially gastric gland atrophy. Here, using AG mouse model, patient samples, gastric organoids, and lineage tracing, this study unraveled gastric stem cell (GSC) defect as a crucial pathogenic factor in AG in mouse and human. Moreover, a natural peptide is isolated from a traditional Chinese medicine that activated GSCs to regenerate gastric epithelia in experimental AG models and revitalized the atrophic gastric organoids derived from patients. It is further shown that the peptide exerts its functions by stabilizing the EGF-EGFR complex and specifically activating the downstream ERK and Stat1 signaling. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of AG pathogenesis and open a new avenue for AG treatment.",

      "abstract": "Much interest has been directed towards stem cells, both in basic and translational research, to understand basic stem cell biology and to develop new therapies for many disorders. In general, stem cells can be cultured with relative ease, however, most common culture methods for stem cells employ 2D techniques using plastic. These cultures do not well represent the stem cell niches in the body, which are delicate microenvironments composed of not only stem cells, but also supporting stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and growth factors. Therefore, researchers and clinicians have been seeking optimal stem cell preparations for basic research and clinical applications, and these might be attainable through 3D culture of stem cells. The 3D cultures recapitulate the in vivo cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions more effectively, and the cells in 3D cultures exhibit many unique and desirable characteristics. The culture of stem cells in 3D may employ various matrices or scaffolds, in addition to the cells, to support the complex structures. The goal of this Special Issue is to bring together recent research on 3D cultures of various stem cells to increase the basic understanding of stem cells and culture techniques, and also highlight stem cell preparations for possible novel therapeutic applications.",

Xeno-free human EPS cells can be long-term and genetically stably maintained in vitro, as well as preserve their embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potentials. Furthermore, the xeno-free culturing system also permits efficient derivation of human EPS cells from human fibroblast through reprogramming.

Recent advances in the field of pluripotent stem cells have made it possible to extend the repertoire of inter-species chimeras to \"systemic\" chimeras, in which the mixing of cells from both species involves all organs including the germline. These chimeric embryos and fetuses open up new research avenues and potential medical applications. We will review the latest advances in the field. We will discuss the concepts of developmental complementation and developmental equivalence. We will discuss the methodological hurdles to be unlocked, as well as the biological and ethical limits of these new technologies.",

      "abstract": "Embryoid bodies (EBs) resemble self-organizing aggregates of pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate some aspects of early embryogenesis. Within few days, the cells undergo a transition from rather homogeneous epithelial-like pluripotent stem cell colonies into a three-dimensional organization of various cell types with multifaceted cell-cell interactions and lumen formation-a process associated with repetitive epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. In the last few years, culture methods have further evolved to better control EB size, growth, cellular composition, and organization-e.g., by the addition of morphogens or different extracellular matrix molecules. There is a growing perception that the mechanical properties, cell mechanics, and cell signaling during EB development are also influenced by physical cues to better guide lineage specification; substrate elasticity and topography are relevant, as well as shear stress and mechanical strain. Epithelial structures outside and inside EBs support the integrity of the cell aggregates and counteract mechanical stress. Furthermore, hydrogels can be used to better control the organization and lineage-specific differentiation of EBs. In this review, we summarize how EB formation is accompanied by a variety of biomechanical parameters that need to be considered for the directed and reproducible self-organization of early cell fate decisions.",

      "abstract": "Human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are highly suitable for regeneration therapies being easily collected and propagated in vitro. The effects of different external factors and culturing conditions are able to affect hADSC proliferation, senescence, differentiation, and migration, even at the molecular level. In the present paper, we exposed hADSCs to an exhausted medium from the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) to evaluate whether the soluble factors released by these cells may be able to induce changes in stem cell behavior. In particular, we investigated the expression of stemness-related genes (OCT4; Sox 2; Nanog), the cell-cycle regulators p21 (WAF1/CIP1) p53, epigenetic markers (DNMT1 and Sirt1), and autophagy-related proteins. From our results, we can infer that the exhausted medium from MCF-7 is able to influence the hADSCs behavior increasing the expression of stemness-related genes, cell proliferation, and autophagy. Polyamines detectable in MCF-7 exhausted medium could be related to the higher proliferation capability observed in hADSCs, suggesting direct crosstalk between these molecules and the observed changes in stem cell potency.",

      "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are associated with tumor progression, recurrence, and therapeutic resistance. To maintain their pool while promoting tumorigenesis, CSCs divide asymmetrically, producing a CSC and a highly proliferative, more differentiated transit-amplifying cell. Exhausting the CSC pool has been proposed as an effective antitumor strategy; however, the mechanism underlying CSC division remains poorly understood, thereby largely limiting its clinical application. Here, through cross-omics analysis, yin yang 2 (YY2) is identified as a novel negative regulator of CSC maintenance. It is shown that YY2 is downregulated in stem-like tumor spheres formed by hepatocarcinoma cells and in liver cancer, in which its expression is negatively correlated with disease progression and poor prognosis. Furthermore, it is revealed that YY2 overexpression suppressed liver CSC asymmetric division, leading to depletion of the CSC pool and decreased tumor-initiating capacity. Meanwhile, YY2 knock-out in stem-like tumor spheres caused enrichment in mitochondrial functions. Mechanistically, it is revealed that YY2 impaired mitochondrial fission, and consequently, liver CSC asymmetric division, by suppressing the transcription of dynamin-related protein 1. These results unravel a novel regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial dynamic-mediated CSCs asymmetric division and highlight the role of YY2 as a tumor suppressor and a therapeutic target in antitumor treatment.",

The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has accelerated the use of MPSs to study human disease in a range of organ systems. However, in the reduction of system complexity, the intricacies of vasculature are an often-overlooked aspect of MPS design. The growing library of pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cell and perivascular cell protocols have great potential to improve the physiological relevance of vasculature within MPS, specifically for in vitro disease modeling. Three strategic categories of vascular MPS are outlined: self-assembled, interface focused, and 3D biofabricated. This review discusses key features and development of the native vasculature, linking that to how hiPSC-derived vascular cells have been generated, the state of the art in vascular MPSs, and opportunities arising from interdisciplinary thinking.",

Here we present a method to generate in vitro-derived satellite cells (idSCs) from skeletal muscle tissue. When transplanted in small numbers into mouse muscle, mouse idSCs fuse into myofibers, repopulate the satellite cell niche, self-renew, support multiple rounds of muscle regeneration and improve force production on par with freshly isolated satellite cells in damaged skeletal muscle. We compared the epigenomic and transcriptional signatures between idSCs, myoblasts and satellite cells and used these signatures to identify core signaling pathways and genes that confer idSC functionality. Finally, from human muscle biopsies, we successfully generated satellite cell-like cells in vitro. After further development, idSCs may provide a scalable source of cells for the treatment of genetic muscle disorders, trauma-induced muscle damage and age-related muscle weakness.",

      "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell-derived retinal organoids (ROs) have been investigated for applications in regenerative medicine, retinal disease models, and compound safety evaluation. Although the development of 3D organoids has provided novel opportunities for innovation, some unresolved limitations continue to exist in organoid research; the passive diffusion of oxygen and nutrients limits the growth and functional gain of organoids. Vascularization may circumvent these problems because it allows oxygen and nutrients to enter the organoid core. In the present study, we generate the vascularized retinal organoids (vROs) from healthy human induced pluripotent stem cells. vROs are created from ROs by co-culturing them with vascular organoid (VO)-derived vascular endothelial cells/pericytes. The expression of mature neuronal markers is markedly higher in the vROs than in the ROs. When vROs are cultured under diabetic conditions, their size and the number of retinal ganglion cells are significantly decreased. In conclusion, the co-culture of ROs with VO-derived cells enables the production of ROs with vascular-like structures, and the vROs respond to severe diabetic retinopathy conditions. In summary, our findings underscore the potential of vROs as invaluable tools for elucidating disease mechanisms and screening therapeutic interventions for retinal vascular disorders, thereby paving the way for personalized medicine approaches in ophthalmology.",

      "abstract": "Recently, stem cell-based therapies have been proposed as an alternative for the treatment of many diseases. Stem cells (SCs) are well known for their capacity to preserve themselves, proliferate, and differentiate into multiple lineages. These characteristics allow stem cells to be a viable option for the treatment of diverse diseases. Traditional methodologies based on 2-dimensional culture techniques (T-flasks and Petri dishes) are simple and well standardized; however, they present disadvantages that limit the production of the cell yield required for regenerative medicine applications. Lately, microcarrier (MC)-based culture techniques have emerged as an attractive platform for expanding stem cells in suspension systems. Although the use of stem cell expansion on MCs has recently shown significant increase, their implementation for medical purposes is been hampered by bottlenecks in upstream and downstream processing. Therefore, there is an urgent need in the development of bioprocesses that simplify stem cell cultures under xeno-free conditions and detachment from MCs without diminishing their pluripotency and viability. A critical analysis of the factors that impact the up and downstream bioprocessing on MC-based stem cell cultures is presented in this review. This analysis aims to raise the awareness of the current drawbacks that limit MC-based stem cell bioprocessing in regenerative medicine and propose alternatives to overcome them.",

      "abstract": "Continuous spermatogenesis depends on the self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). SSCs, the only male reproductive stem cells that transmit genetic material to subsequent generations, possess an inherent self-renewal ability, which allows the maintenance of a steady stem cell pool. SSCs eventually differentiate to produce sperm. However, in an in vitro culture system, SSCs can be induced to differentiate into various types of germ cells. Rodent SSCs are well defined, and a culture system has been successfully established for them. In contrast, available information on the biomolecular markers and a culture system for livestock SSCs is limited. This review summarizes the existing knowledge and research progress regarding mammalian SSCs to determine the mammalian spermatogenic process, the biology and niche of SSCs, the isolation and culture systems of SSCs, and the biomolecular markers and identification of SSCs. This information can be used for the effective utilization of SSCs in reproductive technologies for large livestock animals, enhancement of human male fertility, reproductive medicine, and protection of endangered species.",

      "abstract": "Stem cells and their derivatives are novel pharmaceutics that have the potential for use as tissue replacement therapies. However, the heterogeneous characteristics of stem cell cultures have hindered their biomedical applications. In theory and practice, when cell type-specific or stage-specific cell surface proteins are targeted by unique antibodies, they become highly efficient in detecting and isolating specific cell populations. There is a growing demand to identify reliable and actionable cell surface markers that facilitate purification of particular cell types at specific developmental stages for use in research and clinical applications. The identification of these markers as very important members of plasma membrane proteins, ion channels, transporters, and signaling molecules has directly benefited from proteomics and tools for proteomics-derived data analyses. Here, we review the methodologies that have played a role in the discovery of cell surface markers and introduce cutting edge single cell proteomics as an advanced tool. We also discuss currently available specific cell surface markers for stem cells and their lineages, with emphasis on the nervous system, heart, pancreas, and liver. The remaining gaps that pertain to the discovery of these markers and how single cell proteomics and identification of surface markers associated with the progenitor stages of certain terminally differentiated cells may pave the way for their use in regenerative medicine are also discussed.",

      "title": "Self-organization and culture of Mesenchymal Stem Cell spheroids in acoustic levitation.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, 3D cell culture models such as spheroid or organoid technologies have known important developments. Many studies have shown that 3D cultures exhibit better biomimetic properties compared to 2D cultures. These properties are important for in-vitro modeling systems, as well as for in-vivo cell therapies and tissue engineering approaches. A reliable use of 3D cellular models still requires standardized protocols with well-controlled and reproducible parameters. To address this challenge, a robust and scaffold-free approach is proposed, which relies on multi-trap acoustic levitation. This technology is successfully applied to Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) maintained in acoustic levitation over a 24-h period. During the culture, MSCs spontaneously self-organized from cell sheets to cell spheroids with a characteristic time of about 10 h. Each acoustofluidic chip could contain up to 30 spheroids in acoustic levitation and four chips could be ran in parallel, leading to the production of 120 spheroids per experiment. Various biological characterizations showed that the cells inside the spheroids were viable, maintained the expression of their cell surface markers and had a higher differentiation capacity compared to standard 2D culture conditions. These results open the path to long-time cell culture in acoustic levitation of cell sheets or spheroids for any type of cells.",

In this review we will first discuss the major concerns involved in a suitable EVs production from stem cell culture. Then, we will describe the current techniques for EV isolation, focusing on their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their impact on EVs yield, recovery and functionality. Standardization of the methodology is a prerequisite to compare, to validate and to improve the reliability and credibility of all the different findings reported for the development of EV-based therapeutics.",

The exosomes have gained attention for their potential as disease biomarkers and therapeutic agents. The therapeutic ability of exosomes has been verified by copious previous studies. Effective methods for extensive clinical applications are being researched for exosome-based regenerative therapies, including the application of 3D cultures to enhance exosome production and secretion, which can resolve limited exosome secretion from the parent cells. Cell culture has emerged as a crucial approach for biomedical research because of its many benefits. Both well-established continuous cell lines and primary cell cultures continue to be invaluable for basic research and clinical application. Previous studies have shown that three-dimensional cultured exosomes (3D-Exo) improve therapeutic properties and yields compared with traditional culture systems. Since the majority of studies have focused on exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-Exo), this review will also concentrate on MSC-Exo. In this review, we will summarize the advantages of 3D-Exo and introduce the 3D culture system and methods of exosome isolation, providing scientific strategies for the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of a wide variety of diseases.",

      "abstract": "Adipose stem cells (ASCs) have gained attention in the fields of stem cells regenerative medicine due to their multifaceted therapeutic capabilities. Promising preclinical evidence of ASCs has supported the substantial interest in the use of these cells as therapy for human disease. ASCs are an adult stem cell resident in adipose tissue with the potential to differentiation along mesenchymal lineages. They also are known to be recruited to sites of inflammation where they exhibit strong immunomodulatory capabilities to promote wound healing and regeneration. ASCs can be isolated from adipose tissue at a relatively high yield compared to their mesenchymal cell counterparts: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). Like BM-MSCs, ASCs are easily culture expanded and have a reduced immunogenicity or are perhaps immune privileged, making them attractive options for cellular therapy. Additionally, the heterogeneous cellular product obtained after digestion of adipose tissue, called the stromal vascular fraction (SVF), contains ASCs and several populations of stromal and immune cells. Both the SVF and culture expanded ASCs have the potential to be therapeutic in various diseases. This review will focus on the preclinical and clinical evidence of SVF and ASCs, which make them potential candidates for therapy in regenerative medicine and inflammatory disease processes.",

      "abstract": "For obvious reasons, such as, e.g., ethical concerns or sample accessibility, model systems are of highest importance to study the underlying molecular mechanisms of human maladies with the aim to develop innovative and effective therapeutic strategies. Since many years, animal models and highly proliferative transformed cell lines are successfully used for disease modelling, drug discovery, target validation, and preclinical testing. Still, species-specific differences regarding genetics and physiology and the limited suitability of immortalized cell lines to draw conclusions on normal human cells or specific cell types, are undeniable shortcomings. The progress in human pluripotent stem cell research now allows the growth of a virtually limitless supply of normal and DNA-edited human cells, which can be differentiated into various specific cell types. However, cells in the human body never fulfill their functions in mono-lineage isolation and diseases always develop in complex multicellular ecosystems. The recent advances in stem cell-based 3D organoid technologies allow a more accurate in vitro recapitulation of human pathologies. Embryoids are a specific type of such multicellular structures that do not only mimic a single organ or tissue, but the entire human conceptus or at least relevant components of it. Here we briefly describe the currently existing in vitro human embryo models and discuss their putative future relevance for disease modelling and drug discovery.",

Despite the aggressive characteristics of acute leukemia, AML blasts are difficult to culture once removed from the patient, and LSCs, which are a minor fraction of the blast population, are especially difficult to transplant after culture. This impedes development of new therapies for AML that target LSCs. Here, we present a simple strategy to culture LSCs in cytokine-free medium and to perform flow cytometric analysis of the resulting cell population for the characterization of LSCs maintenance and differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Early human trophoblast development has remained elusive due to the inaccessibility of the early conceptus. Non-human primate models recapitulate many features of human development and allow access to early postimplantation stages. Here, we tracked the pre- to postimplantation transition of the trophoblast lineage in superficially implanting marmoset embryos in vivo. We differentiated marmoset naive pluripotent stem cells into trophoblast stem cells (TSCs), which exhibited trophoblast-specific transcriptome, methylome, differentiation potential, and long-term self-renewal. Notably, human TSC culture conditions failed to support marmoset TSC derivation, instead inducing an extraembryonic mesoderm-like fate in marmoset cells. We show that combined MEK, TGF-β/NODAL, and histone deacetylase inhibition stabilizes a periimplantation trophoblast-like identity in marmoset TSCs. By contrast, these conditions differentiated human TSCs toward extravillous trophoblasts. Our work presents a paradigm to harness the evolutionary divergence in implantation strategies to elucidate human trophoblast development and invasion.",

The first procedure for the transplantation of epidermal cultures in massive full-thickness burns was established in the 1980s. Since then, epithelial stem cell-based therapies have been further developed in cell and gene therapy protocols aimed at restoring visual acuity in severe ocular burns and treating patients affected by genetic skin diseases, as Epidermolysis Bullosa. The clinical success of these Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) requires the presence of a defined number of epithelial stem cells in the grafts, detected as holoclone-forming cells. To date, the most trustworthy method to identify and measure holoclones in a culture is the clonal analysis of clonogenic keratinocytes. Here we describe in detail how to perform such a clonal analysis and identify each epidermal clonal type.",

DSCs provide a perfect opportunity to apply for a patient's own ASC, which poses a low risk of immune rejection. However, problems associated with the long-term culture of stem cells, including loss of proliferation and differentiation capacities, senescence, genetic instability, and the possibility of microbial contamination, make cell banking necessary. With the rapid development of advanced cryopreservation technology, various international DSC banks have been established for both research and clinical applications around the world. However, few studies have been published that provide step-by-step guidance on DSCs isolation and banking methods. The purpose of this review is to present protocols and technical details for all steps of cryopreserved DSCs, from donor selection, isolation, cryopreservation, to characterization and quality control. Here, the emphasis is on presenting practical principles in accordance with the available valid guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Bone tissue is composed of organic minerals and cells. It has the capacity to heal for certain minor damages, but when the bone defects surpass the critical threshold, they need fixing. Bone regeneration through natural and synthetic biodegradable materials requires various steps, such as manufacturing methods and materials selection. A successful biodegradable bone graft should have a high surface area/ volume ratio, strength, and a biocompatible, porous structure capable of promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Considering these requirements, the electrospinning technique is promising for creating functional nano-sized scaffolds. The multi-axial methods, such as coaxial and triaxial electrospinning, are the most popular techniques to produce double or tri-layered scaffolds, respectively. Recently, stem cell culture on scaffolds and the application of osteogenic differentiation protocols on these scaffolds have opened new possibilities in the field of biomaterials research. This review discusses an overview of the progress in coaxial and triaxial technology through biodegradable composite bone materials. The review also carefully elaborates the osteogenic differentiation using stem cells and their performance with nano-sized scaffolds.",

Here we describe a strategy for the generation of 3D murine lung organoids derived from freshly isolated primary tracheal and distal lung epithelial stem cells. Isolated tracheas are subjected to enzymatic digestion to release the epithelial layer that is then dissociated into a single cell suspension for organoid culture. Lung epithelial cells are obtained from dissected lobes, which are applied to mechanical and enzymatic dissociation. After flow sorting, organoids are established from tracheal basal, secretory club, and alveolar type 2 cells in the defined conditioned medium that is required to sustain organoid growth and generate the differentiated cells. Multi-cell-type organoid co-culture replicates niches for distal epithelial stem cells to differentiate into bronchiolar and alveolar cell types. Established organoids can be fixed for wholemount staining and paraffin embedding, or passaged for further culture. Taken together, this protocol provides an efficient and validated approach to generate murine lung organoids, as well as a platform for further analysis.",

      "abstract": "Today, stem cell therapy has been shown to be a remarkable progress and an important application in the regeneration of defective tissues and organs. To deliver stem cells to the injured area, several methods have been proposed such as an intravenous infusion, direct damaged tissue injection, or stem cell sheet transplantation. In this study, we aimed to fabricate a stem cell sheet by culturing human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs) on a Col-T scaffold to recover the structure and function of damaged tissues. The results showed that cells reach confluent on the scaffold surface 18 h after seeding. These stem cells were able to survive and proliferate on Col-T scaffold. The average tensile strength of the stem cell sheet was 2.65 MPa. The sheet reached the sterile standards when tested for total bacteria, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus according to Circular number 06/2011/TT-BYT of Vietnam Ministry of Health. In addition, the stem cell sheet was non-toxic when evaluated for exposure toxicity and fluid toxicity according to iSO-10993. Importantly, 5 days after culturing on the Col-T scaffold, the seeded hUC-MSCs were still possessed all properties of MSC such as spindle-shaped, adhesive, could differentiate into mesoderm-derived cells, showed to be CD90, CD105, CD73 positive and CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19, HLA-DR negative. In summary, our study was successful in creating a stem cell sheet from hUC-MSCs and Col-T scaffold for subsequent in vivo transplantation in the future.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is the largest tissue of the body and performs multiple functions, from locomotion to body temperature control. Its functionality and recovery from injuries depend on a multitude of cell types and on molecular signals between the core muscle cells (myofibers, muscle stem cells) and their niche. Most experimental settings do not preserve this complex physiological microenvironment, and neither do they allow the ex vivo study of muscle stem cells in quiescence, a cell state that is crucial for them. Here, a protocol is outlined for the ex vivo culture of muscle stem cells with cellular components of their niche. Through the mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of muscles, a mixture of cell types is obtained, which is put in 2D culture. Immunostaining shows that within 1 week, multiple niche cells are present in culture alongside myofibers and, importantly, Pax7-positive cells that display the characteristics of quiescent muscle stem cells. These unique properties make this protocol a powerful tool for cell amplification and the generation of quiescent-like stem cells that can be used to address fundamental and translational questions.",

We identify the sources of intrinsic, extrinsic, and external noise in bioprocesses requiring further study, and discuss the criteria and indicators that may be used to assess and predict cell-to-cell variability resulting from environmental fluctuations.

The use of stem cells-that have self-renewal capacity to proliferate and differentiate into specialized cell types-for organoids culturing represents a major advancement in biomedical research. Indeed, this new technology has a great potential to be used in a multitude of fields, including cancer research, hereditary and infectious diseases. Nevertheless, organoid culturing is still rife with many challenges, not limited to being costly and time consuming, having variable rates of efficiency in generation and maintenance, genetic stability, and clinical applications.

      "abstract": "Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is associated with biological processes such as mitochondriogenesis, reproduction, growth, and aging. In addition, PQQ attenuates clinically relevant dysfunctions (e.g., those associated with ischemia, inflammation and lipotoxicity). PQQ is novel among biofactors that are not currently accepted as vitamins or conditional vitamins. For example, the absence of PQQ in diets produces a response like a vitamin-related deficiency with recovery upon PQQ repletion in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, potential health benefits, such as improved metabolic flexibility and immuno-and neuroprotection, are associated with PQQ supplementation. Here, we address PQQ's role as an enzymatic cofactor or accessory factor and highlight mechanisms underlying PQQ's actions. We review both large scale and targeted datasets demonstrating that a neonatal or perinatal PQQ deficiency reduces mitochondria content and mitochondrial-related gene expression. Data are reviewed that suggest PQQ's modulation of lactate acid and perhaps other dehydrogenases enhance NAD+-dependent sirtuin activity, along with the sirtuin targets, such as PGC-1α, NRF-1, NRF-2 and TFAM; thus, mediating mitochondrial functions. Taken together, current observations suggest vitamin-like PQQ has strong potential as a potent therapeutic nutraceutical.",

      "abstract": "Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) is a redox-active quinone molecule with significant implications for human health. Originally identified as a bacterial cofactor, PQQ has since been lauded for its diverse biological and therapeutic activities. It serves as an essential cofactor for oxidative enzymes that are vital for mitochondrial function and ATP synthesis. PQQ exhibits superior antioxidant properties that protect against ROS-mediated oxidative stress, aging, neurodegenerative diseases, certain cancers, diabetes, and metabolic disorders. It also enhances cognitive abilities and reduces insulin sensitivity. PQQ's antioxidant nature helps mitigate oxidative stress, which is implicated in many diseases. It has been shown to target cancer cells selectively, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent. Clinical studies have indicated the potential benefits of PQQ supplementation, including improvements in cardiovascular health, cognitive function, weight management, insulin sensitivity, and the prevention of metabolic syndromes. The safety of PQQ has been established, with no reported toxicity or genotoxicity in various studies, and it is considered a safe nutritional supplement. Future research directions should focus on determining the optimal dosages of PQQ for specific health outcomes and assessing its long-term effectiveness and safety. The translation of PQQ research into clinical practice could offer new strategies for managing metabolic disorders, enhancing cognitive health, and potentially extending lifespan. In summary, PQQ is a promising molecule with broad potential health benefits, impacting human health from cellular metabolism to disease prevention and treatment, positioning it as a key player in nutritional science and public health.",

      "abstract": "Age-related osteoporosis is associated with increased oxidative stress and cellular senescence. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a water-soluble vitamin-like compound that has strong antioxidant capacity; however, the effect and underlying mechanism of PQQ on aging-related osteoporosis remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether dietary PQQ supplementation can prevent osteoporosis caused by natural aging, and the potential mechanism underlying PQQ antioxidant activity. Here, we found that when 6-month-old or 12-month-old wild-type mice were supplemented with PQQ for 12 months or 6 months, respectively, PQQ could prevent age-related osteoporosis in mice by inhibiting osteoclastic bone resorption and stimulating osteoblastic bone formation. Mechanistically, pharmmapper screening and molecular docking studies revealed that PQQ appears to bind to MCM3 and reduces its ubiquitination-mediated degradation; stabilized MCM3 then competes with Nrf2 for binding to Keap1, thus activating Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE) signaling. PQQ-induced Nrf2 activation inhibited bone resorption through increasing stress response capacity and transcriptionally upregulating fibrillin-1 (Fbn1), thus reducing Rankl production in osteoblast-lineage cells and decreasing osteoclast activation; as well, bone formation was stimulated by inhibiting osteoblastic DNA damage and osteocyte senescence. Furthermore, Nrf2 knockout significantly blunted the inhibitory effects of PQQ on oxidative stress, on increased osteoclast activity and on the development of aging-related osteoporosis. This study reveals the underlying mechanism of PQQ's strong antioxidant capacity and provides evidence for PQQ as a potential agent for clinical prevention and treatment of natural aging-induced osteoporosis.",

      "abstract": "Age-related intervertebral disk degeneration (IVDD) involves increased oxidative damage, cellular senescence, and matrix degradation. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a water-soluble vitamin-like compound with strong anti-oxidant capacity. The goal of this study was to determine whether PQQ can prevent aging-related IVDD, and the underlying mechanism. Here, we found that dietary PQQ supplementation for 12 months alleviated IVDD phenotypes in aged mice, including increased disk height index and reduced histological scores and cell loss, without toxicity. Mechanistically, PQQ inhibited oxidative stress, cellular senescence, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in the nucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus of aged mice. Similarly, PQQ protected against interleukin-1β-induced matrix degradation, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and senescence in human nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in vitro. Molecular docking predicted and biochemical assays validated that PQQ interacts with specific residues to dissociate the Keap1-Nrf2 complex, thereby increasing nuclear Nrf2 translocation and activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling. RNA sequencing and luciferase assays revealed Nrf2 can transcriptionally upregulate Wnt5a by binding to its promoter, while Wnt5a knockdown prevented PQQ inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-13 in NPCs. Notably, PQQ supplementation failed to alleviate aging-associated IVDD phenotypes and oxidative stress in aged Nrf2 knockout mice, indicating Nrf2 is indispensable for PQQ bioactivities. Collectively, this study demonstrates Nrf2 activation by PQQ inhibits aging-induced IVDD by attenuating cellular senescence and matrix degradation. This study clarifies Keap1-Nrf2-Wnt5a axis as the novel signaling underlying the protective effects of PQQ against aging-related IVDD, and provides evidence for PQQ as a potential agent for clinical prevention and treatment of natural aging-induced IVDD.",

Originally identified as a cofactor in bacterial enzymes, PQQ has garnered significant interest for its potential therapeutic role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). It has reported that PQQ exerts its effects through several key molecular mechanisms, including the activation of antioxidant pathways via Nrf2/ARE signaling, enhancement of mitochondrial biogenesis and function through AMPK/PGC-1α, and the regulation of inflammatory processes through NF-κB inhibition. By improving cellular energy metabolism, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting neuronal survival, PQQ offers a multifaceted approach to counteracting the pathophysiological factors underlying neurodegeneration. Our review focusing on current study of PQQ on its enhancing neuroplasticity, and protecting neurons from damage induced by oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. Further we reviewed the significant signaling pathways that involved PQQ neuroprotective mechanisms, positioning it as a novel candidate for future therapeutic strategies targeting these debilitating conditions.",

Especially, the molecular mechanism of concomitant deficiency in steroidogenesis-associated enzymes related to testosterone (T) synthesis of obesity dominated a decline in male fertility is still poorly understood. Here, we found that in vivo, supplementation of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) efficaciously ameliorated the abnormal lipid metabolism and testicular spermatogenic function from high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Moreover, the transcriptome analysis of the liver and testicular showed that PQQ supplementation not only inhibited the high expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PCSK9) but also weakened the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)-mediated pyroptosis, which both played a negative role in T synthesis of Leydig Cells (LCs). Eventually, the function and the pyroptosis of LCs cultured with palmitic acid in vitro were simultaneously benefited by suppressing the expression of NLRP3 or PCSK9 respectively, as well the parallel effects of PQQ were affirmed. Collectively, our data revealed that PQQ supplementation is a feasible approach to protect T synthesis from PCSK9-NLRP3 crosstalk-induced LCs' pyroptosis in obese men.",

This condition is marked by low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic abnormalities, including mitochondrial dysfunction. These factors promote energy dysregulation and impact body composition not only by increasing body fat but also by promoting skeletal muscle mass atrophy. The decline in muscle mass is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in individuals with this disease.

      "abstract": "Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is a prevalent complication of thoracic tumor radiotherapy and accidental radiation exposure. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a novel vitamin B, plays a crucial role in delaying aging, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antiapoptosis. This study aims to investigate the protective effect and mechanisms of PQQ against RILI. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a 20 Gy dose of X-ray radiation on the entire thorax with or without daily oral administration of PQQ for 2 weeks. PQQ effectively mitigated radiation-induced lung tissue damage, inflammation, oxidative stress, and epithelial cell apoptosis. Additionally, PQQ significantly inhibited oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in MLE-12 cells. Mechanistically, PQQ upregulated the mRNA and protein levels of MOTS-c in irradiated lung tissue and MLE-12 cells. Knockdown of MOTS-c by siRNA substantially attenuated the protective effects of PQQ on oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. In conclusion, PQQ alleviates RILI by preserving mitochondrial function through a MOTS-c-dependent mechanism, suggesting that PQQ may serve as a promising nutraceutical intervention against RILI.",

      "title": "Pyrroloquinoline-quinone to reduce fat accumulation and ameliorate obesity progression.",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a major health concern worldwide, and its prevalence continues to increase in several countries. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is naturally found in some foods and is available as a dietary supplement in its disodium crystal form. The potential health benefits of PQQ have been studied, considering its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Furthermore, PQQ has been demonstrated to significantly influence the functions of mitochondria, the organelles responsible for energy production within cells, and their dysfunction is associated with various health conditions, including obesity complications. Here, we explore PQQ properties that can be exploited in obesity treatment and highlight the underlying molecular mechanisms. We review animal and cell culture studies demonstrating that PQQ is beneficial for reducing the accumulation of visceral and hepatic fat. In addition to inhibiting lipogenesis, PQQ can increase mitochondria number and function, leading to improved lipid metabolism. Besides diet-induced obesity, PQQ ameliorates programing obesity of the offspring through maternal supplementation and alters gut microbiota, which reduces obesity risk. In obesity progression, PQQ mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction and obesity-associated inflammation, resulting in the amelioration of the progression of obesity co-morbidities, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and Type 2 diabetes. Overall, PQQ has great potential as an anti-obesity and preventive agent for obesity-related complications. Although human studies are still lacking, further investigations to address obesity and associated disorders are still warranted.",

      "title": "Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) improves pulmonary hypertension by regulating mitochondrial and metabolic functions.",
      "abstract": "Excessive proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) and endothelial cells (PAECs), inflammation, as well as mitochondrial and metabolic dysregulation, contributes to the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a potent natural antioxidant with anti-diabetic, neuroprotective, and cardioprotective properties, is known to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. However, its effect on cellular proliferation, apoptosis resistance, mitochondrial and metabolic alterations associated with PH remains unexplored. The current study was designed to investigate the effect of PQQ in the treatment of PH. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs), endothelial cells (PAECs), and primary cultured cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia to induce PH-like phenotype. Furthermore, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats injected with monocrotaline (MCT) (60 mg/kg, SC, once) progressively developed pulmonary hypertension. PQQ treatment (2 mg/kg, PO, for 35 days) attenuated cellular proliferation and promoted apoptosis via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway. Furthermore, PQQ treatment in HPASMCs prevented mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions, improved mitochondrial bioenergetics while preserving respiratory complexes, and reduced insulin resistance. In addition, PQQ treatment (preventive and curative) significantly attenuated the increase in right ventricle pressure and hypertrophy as well as reduced endothelial dysfunction and pulmonary artery remodeling in MCT-treated rats. PQQ also prevented cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac functions as well as reduced inflammation in MCT-treated rats. Altogether, the above findings demonstrate that PQQ can attenuate mitochondrial as well as metabolic abnormalities in PASMCs and also prevent the development of PH in MCT treated rats; hence PQQ may act as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of PH.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a pressing concern in neurodegenerative research. To address the challenges in AD drug development, especially those targeting Aβ, this study uses deep learning and a pharmacological approach to elucidate the potential of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a neuroprotective agent for AD. Using deep learning for a comprehensive molecular dataset, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability is predicted and the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of compounds are evaluated. PQQ, identified in the Mediterranean-DASH intervention for a diet that delays neurodegeneration, shows notable BBB permeability and low toxicity. In vivo tests conducted on an Aβ₁₋₄₂-induced AD mouse model verify the effectiveness of PQQ in reducing cognitive deficits. PQQ modulates genes vital for synapse and anti-neuronal death, reduces reactive oxygen species production, and influences the SIRT1 and CREB pathways, suggesting key molecular mechanisms underlying its neuroprotective effects. This study can serve as a basis for future studies on integrating deep learning with pharmacological research and drug discovery.",

      "title": "Understanding the Inhibitory and Antioxidant Effects of Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) on Copper(II)-Induced α-Synuclein-119 Aggregation.",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with the aggregation and misfolding of a-synuclein (a-syn) protein in dopaminergic neurons. The misfolding process is heavily linked to copper dysregulation in PD. Experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the co-presence of Cu(II) and α-syn facilitates the aggregation of α-syn, affecting the pathological development of PD. Recent literature has shown that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) contains strong neuroprotective activity by reducing the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by α-syn. Despite these known facts, minimal studies have been done on the antioxidant effect of PQQ against ROS formation in the presence of Cu(II) and α-syn-119. Thus, it is of great significance to study the interaction between all three components, PQQ, Cu(II), and α-syn-119. In this proof-of-concept study, a variety of chemical techniques were employed to examine the antioxidant effect of PQQ on ROS that α-syn-119 produced in the presence of Cu(II). Our results showed that PQQ effectively prevented ROS formation in SH-SY5Y human differentiated neuronal cells. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were applied, where PQQ was able to actively prevent fibrillation of α-syn-119 in the presence of Cu(II). This finding was further confirmed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), where the binding of PQQ to the α-syn-119 suppressed the aggregation process on the electrode surface. With these encouraging results, we envisage that PQQ and its derivatives can be a promising candidate for further studies as a multitarget therapeutic agent toward PD therapy.",

Now, it is approved as a food in Japan and the EU. PQQ has redox properties and exerts antioxidant, neuroprotective, and mitochondrial biogenesis effects. The baseline intake level of PQQ is considered to be 20 mg/day. PQQ ingestion lowers blood lipid peroxide levels in humans, suggesting antioxidant activity. In the field of cognitive function, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have been conducted. Various improvements have been reported regarding general memory, verbal memory, working memory, and attention. Furthermore, a stratified analysis of a population with a wide range of ages revealed unique effects in young people (20-40 years old) that were not observed in older adults (41-65 years old). Specifically, cognitive flexibility and executive speed improved more rapidly in young people at 8 weeks. Co-administration of PQQ and coenzyme Q10 further enhanced these effects. In an open-label trial, PQQ was shown to improve sleep and mood. Additionally, PQQ was found to suppress skin moisture loss and increase PGC-1α expression. Overall, PQQ is a food with various functions, including brain health benefits. J. Med. Invest. 71 : 23-28, February, 2024.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is an aging-related mechanism characterized by cell cycle arrest, macromolecular alterations, and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Recent preclinical trials established that senolytic drugs, which target survival mechanisms of senescent cells, can effectively intervene in age-related pathologies. In contrast, senomorphic agents inhibiting SASP expression while preserving the survival of senescent cells have received relatively less attention, with potential benefits hitherto underexplored. By revisiting a previously screened natural product library, which enabled the discovery of procyanidin C1 (PCC1), we noticed pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redox cofactor that displayed remarkable potential in serving as a senomorphic agent. In vitro data suggested that PQQ downregulated the full spectrum expression of the SASP, a capacity observed in several stromal cell lines. Proteomics data supported that PQQ directly targets the intracellular protein HSPA8, interference with which disturbs downstream signaling and expression of the SASP. PQQ restrains cancer cell malignancy conferred by senescent stromal cells in culture while reducing drug resistance when combined with chemotherapy in anticancer regimens. In preclinical trials, PQQ alleviates pathological symptoms by preventing organ degeneration in naturally aged mice while reserving senescent cells in the tissue microenvironment. Together, our study supports the feasibility of exploiting a redox-active quinone molecule with senomorphic capacity to achieve geroprotective effects by modulating the SASP, thus providing proof-of-concept evidence for future exploration of natural antioxidant agents to delay aging and ameliorate age-related conditions. Prospective efforts are warranted to determine long-term outcomes and the potential of PQQ for the intervention of geriatric syndromes in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "We investigated whether the oxidoreductase cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) prevents noise-induced and age-related hearing loss (NIHL and ARHL) in mice. To assess NIHL, 8 week-old mice with and without PQQ administration were exposed to noise for 4 h. PQQ was orally administered for one week before and after noise exposure and subcutaneously once before noise exposure. For ARHL evaluation, mice were given drinking water with or without PQQ starting at 2 months of age. In the NIHL model, PQQ-treated mice had auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds of significantly reduced elevation at 8 kHz, a significantly increased number of hair cells at the basal turn, and significantly better maintained synapses beneath the inner hair cells compared to controls. In the ARHL model, PQQ significantly attenuated the age-related increase in ABR thresholds at 8 and 32 kHz at 10 months of age compared to controls. In addition, the hair cells, spiral ganglion cells, ribbon synapses, stria vascularis and nerve fibers were all significantly better maintained in PQQ-treated animals compared to controls at 10 months of age. These physiological and histological results demonstrate that PQQ protects the auditory system from NIHL and ARHL in mice.",

Seventy-two barrows were divided into three groups: control (CTRL), LPS challenged (LPS), and LPS challenged with PQQ supplementation (PQQ + LPS). On d 7, 11, and 14, piglets received intraperitoneal injections of LPS or 0.9% of NaCl (80 μg/kg). After a 4 h interval following the final LPS injection on d 14, blood samples were obtained, and all piglets were euthanized for harvesting jejunal samples.

      "abstract": "Natural ovarian aging is one of the major causes for declining fertility in female animals, which has become an insurmountable issue in human reproduction clinics and assisted reproductive technology procedures. Nevertheless, the molecular basis of oocyte aging remains poorly understood, and feasible improvement strategies are unavailable. In the present study, in vivo supplementation of pyrroloquinoline-quinone effectively elevated the fecundity of reproductively aged mice by balancing hormonal secretion, harmonizing the estrus cycle, and eliminating ovarian fibrosis. Moreover, oocyte quality also increased in aged mice after pyrroloquinoline-quinone administration from various aspects, including nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation competency, fertilization capacity, and pre-implantation embryonic development potential. Transcriptomic analysis identified target pathways that might mediate pyrroloquinoline-quinone's effects in aged oocytes. Specifically, it was demonstrated that pyrroloquinoline-quinone supplementation restored the mitochondrial dynamics and lysosomal function to remove excessive reactive oxygen species and suppress apoptosis in aged oocytes. Jointly, these findings demonstrate pyrroloquinoline-quinone administration is an efficacious method to restore the compromised ovary function and damaged oocyte quality in reproductively aged mice, which might be a potential clinical therapy for women of advanced maternal age with infertility.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication commonly characterized by high blood pressure. Although it is generally believed that the placenta is the root cause of PE, the exact pathogenesis is unknown; consequently, there is no standard clinical treatment. Therefore, it is necessary to explore new therapeutic drugs. Several studies have reported that pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of PQQ diet supplementation on PE-like rat models. L-NAME induced PE-like model rats were intraperitonially administrated with PQQ. The results showed that PQQ significantly improved clinical manifestations and pregnancy outcomes of PE-like rats. The levels of related inflammatory and antioxidant markers were also significantly reversed. A mechanism study showed that PQQ may achieve the above therapeutic effects by inhibiting NF-κB and promoting Nrf2 antioxidant pathways. In conclusion, we showed the protective effect of PQQ on PE-like model rats, by improving anti-inflammation and antioxidation effect through the NF-κB-Nrf2 pathway.",

      "abstract": "Glucose is taken up by Escherichia coli through the phosphotransferase system (PTS) as the preferred carbon source. PTS mutants grow with glucose as a carbon source only in the presence of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), which is needed as a redox cofactor for the glucose dehydrogenase Gcd. The membrane-anchored Gcd enzyme oxidises glucose to gluconolactone in the periplasm. For this reaction to occur, external supply of PQQ is required as E. coli is unable to produce PQQ de novo. Growth experiments show that PqqU (previously YncD) is the TonB-ExbBD-dependent transporter for PQQ through the outer membrane. PQQ protected the cells from the PqqU-dependent phage IsaakIselin (Bas10) by competition for the receptor protein. As a high affinity uptake system, PqqU allows E. coli to activate Gcd even at surrounding PQQ concentrations of about 1 nmoL/L. At about 30-fold higher PQQ concentrations, the activation of Gcd gets PqqU independent. Due to its small size, Pqq may also pass the outer membrane through porins. The PQQ-dependent production of gluconate has been demonstrated in many plant growth-promoting bacteria that solubilise phosphate minerals in the soil by secreting this acid. Under phosphate limiting conditions also E. coli induces the glucose dehydrogenase and secretes gluconate, even in absence of PTS, that is, even when the bacterium is unable to grow on glucose without PQQ.",

      "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable biological process, driven in part by increased oxidative stress, which accelerates cellular damage and contributes to immune system dysfunction. Therefore, targeting oxidative stress has emerged as a potential strategy. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a potent antioxidant, has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing oxidative stress and modulating immune responses, making it a promising therapeutic candidate. In this study, we investigated the effects of aging on the hematopoietic immune system (HIS) through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of spleen and bone marrow cells in murine models. Our results revealed widespread age-related inflammation and oxidative stress within immune cell populations. Notably, long-term PQQ supplementation improved physiological parameters and reduced blood inflammatory factors levels in aged mice. Subsequent scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated that PQQ supplementation effectively reduced oxidative stress levels across various HIS cell types and reversed aging-related phenotypes, such as inflammatory responses and immunosenescence. Additionally, PQQ reversed aging-induced disrupted signaling and restored immune homeostasis, particularly in B cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Importantly, we identified critical molecular targets, including ASPP1, which mediates PQQ's anti-apoptotic effects in B cells, and Yy1 and CD62L, which were upregulated by PQQ to restore HSCs self-renewal and differentiation potential. Furthermore, the machine learning program and experimental validation demonstrated the senolytic and senomorphic effects of PQQ in vivo and vitro. These findings underscore PQQ's potential not only in mitigating oxidative stress but also in restoring immune homeostasis and promoting cellular regeneration, highlighting its therapeutic potential in addressing immune aging and improving physiological function.",

      "abstract": "Our study aimed to reveal the effects and changes, antioxidant metabolism (Oxidative Stress), inflammatory response, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial dysfunction characteristics in hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2; that occur in genes (NRF-1, NRF-2, NFκB and PGC-1α) and miRNAs (miR15-a, miR16-1, miR181-c) that can control related features. To investigate the effects of Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in HepG2, and their effects on cell viability, lateral cell migration, gene expression and miRNA expression levels were investigated. If the data we have obtained are evaluated in terms of anti-cancer effectiveness, the most effective use of CoQ10 can be defined as the use alone rather than the combined use. According to the results of the wound healing experiment, we determined that Pyrroloquinoline quinone and combined drug application increased the wound closure area and cell proliferation compared to the control group, while CoQ10 application decreased it. We found that Pyrroloquinoline quinone and Coenzyme Q10 exposure in the HepG2 cell line increased Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) expression but not NRF-1 gene expression. We reported only a small increase in expression of the NRF-2 gene in the Pyrroloquinoline quinone application compared to the control group. We found that only Pyrroloquinoline quinone and CoQ10 application caused more expression increase in the Nuclear Factor kappa B (NFκB) gene compared to combined application. Pyrroloquinoline quinone and CoQ10 administration down-regulated the expression levels of miR16-1, miR15a and miR181c. The use of Pyrroloquinoline quinone and CoQ10 is effective on epigenetic factors, miR-15a, miR-16-1 and miR181c are important candidate biomarkers in hepatocellular carcinoma and diseases accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-induced heart inflammation may originate from either COVID-19 infection or the administration of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. As pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a scavenger of free radicals, redox cofactor, and antioxidant which supports cognitive and mitochondrial functions, supplementation with PQQ could have a positive effect to reduce heart inflammation after COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. However, there is no evidence yet for this opportunity in the literature. Cellular and animal model results are missing. Similarly, no clinical trials have been conducted. While it is recommended to measure the levels of the cardiac biomarkers before and after COVID-19 vaccination, no recommendation can be made about supplementation with PQQ, which, however, we note has no contraindication.",

      "abstract": "Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) has recently been implicated as an obesogen. Our recent study demonstrated that BBP can exacerbate high fat diet (HFD) induced diabesity in male mice. Here, we explored if pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a natural antioxidant andphytochemical, can attenuate metabolic aberrations induced by HFD or HFD-BBPcombination. C57Bl/6 male and female mice were fed either a chow diet (CD) or HFD with or without BBP (3 mg/kg body weight/day)and/or PQQ (20 mg/kg/day)for 16 weeks. The mice's body and tissue weight, fasting blood glucose, glucose and insulin tolerance test, and liver metabolites level weremeasured. In HFD-fed male mice, PQQ significantly attenuated the increased body weight, liver weight, fasting blood glucose, and insulin intolerance under BBP exposure.Even though female mice did show some reversal of metabolic characteristics by PQQ, the response was not similar nor consistent with the male population. Amongthe 14 hepatic metabolites that were significantly altered by HFD compared to CD, only three major metabolites (acetyl-L-carnitine, DL-stachytine, and propionylcarnitine) were decreased. These three were shown to have more reduction under BBP exposure in the presence of HFD whereas with addition of PQQ, these metabolites were restored. Pathway analysis and literature search revealed that these metabolites were negatively associated with obesity and were involved in several pathways including beta-oxidation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Overall,this finding indicated the potential use of PQQ to restore thewide range of aberrant metabolic effectinduced by an obesogen in the presence of a western diet.",

      "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells are highly metabolically active requiring strictly regulated metabolism and functional mitochondria to keep ATP levels in physiological range. Imbalances in metabolism and mitochondrial mechanisms can be sufficient to induce a depletion of ATP, thus altering retinal ganglion cell viability and increasing cell susceptibility to death under stress. Altered metabolism and mitochondrial abnormalities have been demonstrated early in many optic neuropathies, including glaucoma, autosomal dominant optic atrophy, and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is a quinone cofactor and is reported to have numerous effects on cellular and mitochondrial metabolism. However, the reported effects are highly context-dependent, indicating the need to study the mechanism of PQQ in specific systems. We investigated whether PQQ had a neuroprotective effect under different retinal ganglion cell stresses and assessed the effect of PQQ on metabolic and mitochondrial processes in cortical neuron and retinal ganglion cell specific contexts. We demonstrated that PQQ is neuroprotective in two models of retinal ganglion cell degeneration. We identified an increased ATP content in healthy retinal ganglion cell-related contexts both in in vitro and in vivo models. Although PQQ administration resulted in a moderate effect on mitochondrial biogenesis and content, a metabolic variation in non-diseased retinal ganglion cell-related tissues was identified after PQQ treatment. These results suggest the potential of PQQ as a novel neuroprotectant against retinal ganglion cell death.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation alleviates metabolic defects in diseased recipient cells by intercellular mitochondrial transport (IMT). However, the effect of host metabolic conditions on IMT and thereby on the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs has largely remained unexplored. Here we found impaired mitophagy, and reduced IMT in MSCs derived from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse (MSC-Ob). MSC-Ob failed to sequester their damaged mitochondria into LC3-dependent autophagosomes due to decrease in mitochondrial cardiolipin content, which we propose as a putative mitophagy receptor for LC3 in MSCs. Functionally, MSC-Ob exhibited diminished potential to rescue mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in stress-induced airway epithelial cells. Pharmacological modulation of MSCs enhanced cardiolipin-dependent mitophagy and restored their IMT ability to airway epithelial cells. Therapeutically, these modulated MSCs attenuated features of allergic airway inflammation (AAI) in two independent mouse models by restoring healthy IMT. However, unmodulated MSC-Ob failed to do so. Notably, in human (h)MSCs, induced metabolic stress associated impaired cardiolipin-dependent mitophagy was restored upon pharmacological modulation. In summary, we have provided the first comprehensive molecular understanding of impaired mitophagy in obese-derived MSCs and highlight the importance of pharmacological modulation of these cells for therapeutic intervention. A MSCs obtained from (HFD)-induced obese mice (MSC-Ob) show underlying mitochondrial dysfunction with a concomitant decrease in cardiolipin content. These changes prevent LC3-cardiolipin interaction, thereby reducing dysfunctional mitochondria sequestration into LC3-autophagosomes and thus impaired mitophagy. The impaired mitophagy is associated with reduced intercellular mitochondrial transport (IMT) via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) between MSC-Ob and epithelial cells in co-culture or in vivo. B Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) modulation in MSC-Ob restores mitochondrial health, cardiolipin content, and thereby sequestration of depolarized mitochondria into the autophagosomes to alleviate impaired mitophagy. Concomitantly, MSC-Ob shows restoration of mitochondrial health upon PQQ treatment (MSC-ObPQQ). During co-culture with epithelial cells or transplantation in vivo into the mice lungs, MSC-ObPQQ restores IMT and prevents epithelial cell death. C Upon transplantation in two independent allergic airway inflammatory mouse models, MSC-Ob failed to rescue the airway inflammation, hyperactivity, metabolic changes in epithelial cells. D PQQ modulated MSCs restored these metabolic defects and restored lung physiology and airway remodeling parameters.",

      "abstract": "PQQ has anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. PQQ can relieve high glucose-induced renal cell damage by suppressing Keap1 expression. Keap1 can interact with CUL3. Upregulation of CUL3 facilitates the apoptosis of LPS-induced podocytes. Based on knowledge above, this current work was designed to explore the role of PQQ in sepsis and determine the molecular function of CUL3 in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Rats received CLP surgery to establish sepsis models in vivo. Kupffer cells were pretreated with PQQ (10, 50 and 100 nmol/L) for 2 h and then treated with 100 ng/mL LPS for 24 h, simulating sepsis-induced acute liver injury in vitro. H&E staining was performed to evaluate liver injury of SD rats. Levels of inflammatory factors and oxidative stress markers were detected to assess inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Moreover, TUNEL staining, flow cytometric analysis and western blot were applied to determine cell apoptosis. It was confirmed that PQQ treatment relieved acute liver injury, inflammatory and oxidative stress damage and apoptosis of liver tissue cells in sepsis rats. In addition, PQQ therapy could alleviate inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis in LPS-induced Kupffer cells. Notably, LPS stimulation enhanced CUL3 expression and PQQ repressed CUL3 expression in Kupffer cells suffered from LPS. Overall, CUL3 overexpression weakened the remission effects of PQQ on LPS-induced inflammatory and oxidative damage and apoptosis of Kupffer cells. Mechanistically, PQQ treatment may mitigate sepsis-induced acute liver injury through downregulating CUL3 expression.",

A technique that allows the recovery and repeated use of PQQ for protein cross-linking by covalent attachment to magnetic Sepharose beads is developed. The produced material closely resembles natural elastin in its molecular, biochemical, and mechanical properties, enabled by the occurrence of the cross-linking amino acids desmosine, isodesmosine, and merodesmosine. It possesses elevated resistance against tryptic proteolysis, and its Young's modulus ranging between 1 and 2 MPa is similar to that of natural elastin.

      "abstract": "Imbalances of soil available nutrients and soilborne diseases have seriously restricted the productivity of crops and jeopardized food security worldwide. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redox cofactor in some bacteria involved in glucose metabolism and phosphorus mineralization, could be anticipated to alter soil ecosystems to a certain extent. However, there is limited information on PQQ defending soilborne pathogens and regulating soil main nutrients. Here, a pot experiment based on mono-cropping soils of pepper was conducted to examine the effects of PQQ amendment on reconstructing soil microbial communities and soil nutrients under aerobic/anaerobic conditions comprising three treatments, namely, control, PQQ (aerobic), and FL-PQQ (anaerobic). The results revealed that soil microbial community composition and soil nutrients were distinctly altered by PQQ regimes. Compared to control, PQQ treatment significantly increased the content of soil available phosphorus (AP), while FL_PQQ treatment strongly improved the content of soil available nitrogen (AN). In terms of pathogens, relative to control, both PQQ treatments suppressed the abundances of pathogens, of which FL_PQQ treatment significantly decreased the abundance of the pathotrophic fungal by 64% and the abundance of Fusarium oxysporum by 57%, largely attributed to the increase of organic acid generators (O",

      "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that oxidative stress is related to periodontitis, and that pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ) acts as a powerful antioxidant. This study aimed to explore the effect of PQQ on ligature-induced alveolar bone loss in experimental periodontitis (EP) mice with/without PQQ in the diet. EP mice received a diet supplemented with PQQ for 2 weeks and were compared with sham (control) mice as well as untreated EP mice. Additionally, human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs) were treated with PQQ in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that the bone volume fraction, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the number of antioxidant cells were significantly decreased in EP mice compared with the sham mice, whereas PQQ administration rescued the above effects. In contrast, alveolar bone loss, osteoclast number, cell senescence-associated cells, and cytokines' expression were significantly increased in EP mice compared with the sham mice but were significantly decreased with PQQ supplementation in periodontal tissues. Furthermore, we found that antioxidant enzymes and Bmi-1 protein expression levels were downregulated, whereas the protein expression levels of cell senescence-related proteins including γ-H2AX, IL-6, IL-1β, p16, and p21 were significantly up-regulated in LPS-induced hPDLCs compared with the control cells. However, PQQ administration partially prevented these changes. These findings suggest that PQQ may alleviate periodontal damage through regulation of the redox balance and cell senescence.",

      "abstract": "Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) has a variety of biological functions. However, rare attention has been paid to its effects on exercise-induced damage. Here, we assessed the potential protective effects of PQQ against the fatigue and oxidative damage caused by repeated exhaustive exercise, and studied the underlying mechanism. The models for exercise-induced fatigue were established, and the parameters were measured, including the time to exhaustion (TTE), biochemical indicators, the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and inflammatory cytokines and so on. Besides, the mitochondrial function was evaluated by the morphology, membrane potential, respiratory function, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and the application of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. The results demonstrate that PQQ prolongs TTE, causes the decrease in the activity of serum creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes, inhibits the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and diminishes the over expression of NF-κB (p65) and inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, PQQ preserves normal mitochondrial function. Particularly, PQQ reduces the accumulation of ROS triggered by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor. These data suggest that PQQ can significantly protect mice from exercise-induced fatigue and oxidative damage by improving mitochondrial function. These data also suggest that PQQ controls mitochondrial activity through directly affecting the NADH dehydrogenase.",

      "abstract": "Diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP) is commonly used in the plastics industry, and recent studies have shown that environmental exposure and accumulation in the food chain caused inflammation in some organs. However, the underlying mechanisms by which DiBP affects oocyte quality have not yet been fully defined. We used immunostaining and fluorescence to evaluate the effects of DiBP exposure and demonstrated that it impaired the morphology of matured porcine oocytes through generation of cytoplasmic fragmentation, accompanied by the perturbed dynamics of the spindle and actin cytoskeleton, misdistributed endoplasmic reticulum, as well as partial exocytosis of cortical granules and ovastacin. Moreover, analysis of Smart RNA-seq found that DiBP-induced aberrant oocyte maturation could be induced by abnormal mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Importantly, we discovered that supplementation with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) significantly attenuated the meiotic abnormalities induced by DiBP exposure through the modulation of reactive oxygen species levels. Our findings demonstrated that DiBP exposure adversely affects oocyte meiotic maturation and that PQQ supplementation was an effective strategy to protect oocyte quality against DiBP exposure.",

      "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the potential ameliorative effects of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced liver injury in mice. The liver injury model was established by injecting mice with CTX (80 mg/kg/day). Liver function indices, antioxidant enzyme activities, and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated. In addition, protein expression levels of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathways in the liver tissues were determined using western blot. The results indicated that PQQ decreased the serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and the malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in the liver tissues. Moreover, PQQ enhanced the activities of oxidative stress markers to alleviate CTX induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, the expression levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) were significantly increased, and the expression levels of NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, and inhibitor of NF-κB kinase alpha (IKKα) were significantly decreased after PQQ administration, suggesting that PQQ alleviated CTX-induced liver injury via activating the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response pathway, and inhibiting the NF-κB-mediated inflammation pathway. Therefore, PQQ can be potentially used as a dietary supplement or functional foods for alleviating the CTX-induced liver injury.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are bacterial surface glycolipids, produced by Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is known to determine acute inflammatory reactions, particularly in the context of sepsis. However, LPS can also trigger chronic inflammation. In this case, the source of LPS is not an external infection, but rather an increase in endogenous production, which is usually sustained by gut microbiota (GM), and LPS contained in food. The first site in which LPS can exert its inflammatory action is the gut: both GM and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are influenced by LPS and shift towards an inflammatory pattern. The changes in GM and GALT induced by LPS are quite similar to the ones seen in IBD: GM loses diversity, while GALT T regulatory (Tregs) lymphocytes are reduced in number, with an increase in Th17 and Th1 lymphocytes. Additionally, the innate immune system is triggered, through the activation of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, while the epithelium is directly damaged, further triggering inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the importance of the crosstalk between LPS, GM, and GALT, and discuss the possible implications.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory therapies, inflammation and its consequences still remain a significant problem in medicine. Acute inflammatory responses are responsible for directly life-threating conditions such as septic shock; on the other hand, chronic inflammation can cause degeneration of body tissues leading to severe impairment of their function. Neuroinflammation is defined as an inflammatory response in the central nervous system involving microglia, astrocytes, and cytokines including chemokines. It is considered an important cause of neurodegerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a strong immunogenic particle present in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is a major triggering factor for the inflammatory cascade in response to a Gram-negative bacteria infection. The use of LPS as a strong pro-inflammatory agent is a well-known model of inflammation applied in both in vivo and in vitro studies. This review offers a summary of the pathogenesis associated with LPS exposure, especially in the field of neuroinflammation. Moreover, we analyzed different in vivo LPS models utilized in the area of neuroscience. This paper presents recent knowledge and is focused on new insights in the LPS experimental model.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis often causes organ dysfunction and is manifested in increased endothelial cell permeability in blood vessels. Early-stage inflammation is accompanied by metabolic changes, but it is unclear how the metabolic alterations in the endothelial cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation affect endothelial cell function. In this study, the effects of 1 μg/ml of LPS on the metabolism of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were investigated, and the metabolic changes after LPS stimulation were explained from the perspective of mRNA expression, chromatin openness and metabolic flux. We found changes in the central metabolism of endothelial cells after LPS stimulation, such as enhanced glycolysis function, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Sphingolipid metabolic pathways change at the transcriptome level, and sphingosine-1-phosphatase 2 (SGPP2) was upregulated in LPS-stimulated endothelial cells and zebrafish models. Overexpression of SGPP2 improved cell barrier function, enhanced mitochondrial respiration capacity, but also produced oxidative respiration chain uncoupling. In addition, SGPP2 overexpression inhibited the degradation of HIF-1α protein. The molecular and biochemical processes identified in this study are not only beneficial for understanding the metabolic-related mechanisms of LPS-induced endothelial injury, but also for the discovery of general therapeutic targets for inflammation and inflammation-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) rapidly clear lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bloodstream and establish intimate contact with immune cells. However, their role in regulating liver inflammation remains poorly understood. We show that LSECs modify their chemokine expression profile driven by LPS or interferon-γ (IFN-γ), resulting in the production of the myeloid- or lymphoid-attracting chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10, respectively, which accumulate in the serum of LPS-challenged animals. Natural killer (NK) cell exposure to LSECs in vitro primes NK cells for higher production of IFN-γ in response to interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-18. In livers of LPS-injected mice, NK cells are the major producers of this cytokine. In turn, LSECs require exposure to IFN-γ for CXCL10 expression, and endothelial-specific Cxcl10 gene deletion curtails NK cell accumulation in the inflamed livers. Thus, LSECs respond to both LPS and immune-derived signals and fuel a positive feedback loop of immune cell attraction and activation in the inflamed liver tissue.",

      "abstract": "Immune cell infiltrations with lobular inflammation in the background of steatosis and deregulated gut-liver axis are the cardinal features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). An array of gut microbiota-derived metabolites including short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) multifariously modulates NASH pathogenesis. However, the molecular basis for the favorable impact of sodium butyrate (NaBu), a gut microbiota-derived SCFA, on the immunometabolic homeostasis in NASH remains elusive. We show that NaBu imparts a robust anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated or classically activated M1 polarized macrophages and in the diet-induced murine NASH model. Moreover, it impedes monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophage recruitment in liver parenchyma and induces apoptosis of proinflammatory liver macrophages (LM) in NASH livers. Mechanistically, by histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibition NaBu enhanced acetylation of canonical NF-κB subunit p65 along with its differential recruitment to the proinflammatory gene promoters independent of its nuclear translocation. NaBu-treated macrophages thus exhibit transcriptomic signatures that corroborate with a M2-like prohealing phenotype. NaBu quelled LPS-mediated catabolism and phagocytosis of macrophages, exhibited a differential secretome which consequently resulted in skewing toward prohealing phenotype and induced death of proinflammatory macrophages to abrogate metaflammation in vitro and in vivo. Thus NaBu could be a potential therapeutic as well as preventive agent in mitigating NASH.",

      "abstract": "Systemic inflammation is associated with chronic disease and is purported to be a main pathogenic mechanism underlying metabolic conditions. Microbes harbored in the host gastrointestinal tract release signaling byproducts from their cell wall, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which can act locally and, after crossing the gut barrier and entering circulation, also systemically. Defined as metabolic endotoxemia, elevated concentrations of LPS in circulation are associated with metabolic conditions and chronic disease. As such, measurement of LPS is highly prevalent in animal and human research investigating these states. Indeed, LPS can be a potent stimulant of host immunity, but this response depends on the microbial species' origin, a parameter often overlooked in both preclinical and clinical investigations. Indeed, the lipid A portion of LPS is mutable and comprises the main virulence and endotoxic component, thus contributing to the structural and functional diversity among LPSs from microbial species. In this review, we discuss how such structural differences in LPS can induce differential immunological responses in the host.",

      "abstract": "The outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria is primarily composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition to protection, LPS defines the distinct serogroups used to identify bacteria specifically. Furthermore, LPS also act as highly potent stimulators of innate immune cells, a phenomenon essential to understanding pathogen invasion in the body. The complex multi-step process of LPS binding to cells involves several binding partners, including LPS binding protein (LBP), CD14 in both membrane-bound and soluble forms, membrane protein MD-2, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Once these pathways are activated, pro-inflammatory cytokines are eventually expressed. These binding events are also affected by the presence of monomeric or aggregated LPS. Traditional techniques to detect LPS include the rabbit pyrogen test, the monocyte activation test and Limulus-based tests. Modern approaches are based on protein, antibodies or aptamer binding. Recently, novel techniques including electrochemical methods, HPLC, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and molecular imprinting have been developed. These approaches often use nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles, quantum dots, nanotubes, and magnetic nanoparticles. This chapter reviews current developments in endotoxin detection with a focus on modern novel techniques that use various sensing components, ranging from natural biomolecules to synthetic materials. Highly integrated and miniaturized commercial endotoxin detection devices offer a variety of options as the scientific and technologic revolution proceeds.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria which contributes to bacterial toxicity. During processes such as cell division, shedding of outer membrane vesicles, or bacterial cell death, LPS is released into the surrounding media. If such contamination got into the bloodstream, it would induce pro-inflammatory immune responses which can result in sepsis and death. Therefore, detection of LPS is essential in the pharmaceutical and food industries to prevent patients being exposed to LPS. The Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay is the current major assay used by industry to detect and quantify LPS contamination. However, in recent years the phenomenon of Low Endotoxin Recovery (LER) has gained significant scientific attention. The phenomenon describes the inability of LAL assays, in some cases, to detect LPS due to a masking effect caused by interaction with formulation excipients. Although the mechanism of LER has not been fully determined, it is widely thought that the origin of the effect is associated with these interactions perturbing the supramolecular formation of LPS aggregates. Whilst the phenomenon of LER is highly complex and remains to be entirely understood, herein we aim to provide a state-of-the-art review of the ongoing and, at times, controversial topics of LER research. We overview the current understanding of the relationship between LPS structure and toxicity, conditions in which the supramolecular arrangement of LPS can be altered, the hypothesised mechanisms of LER, and discuss the possible risk of masked LPS remaining biologically toxic upon administration to patients.",

In this Review, we will give the reader a third millennium update of the current knowledge of LPS with key information on the inherent peculiar carbohydrate chemistry due to often puzzling sugar residues that are uniquely found on it. Then, we will drive the reader through the complex and multifarious immunological outcomes that any given LPS can raise, which is strictly dependent on its chemical structure. Further, we will argue about issues that still remain unresolved and that would represent the immediate future of LPS research. It is critical to address these points to complete our notions on LPS chemistry, functions, and roles, in turn leading to innovative ways to manipulate the processes involving such a still controversial and intriguing biomolecule.",

      "abstract": "The acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is still among the most commonly used models in animal studies of acute lung injury or acute inflammation. The current most commonly used methods in acute lung injury mouse models are an intraperitoneal injection of LPS and tracheostomy for the tracheal infusion of LPS. However, the former method lacks lung targeting and damages other organs, and the latter method induces operative trauma, infection risk, and a low survival rate. Here, we recommend a noninvasive oropharyngeal endotracheal intubation method for LPS instillation in mice. In this method, LPS is noninvasively introduced into the trachea through the oropharyngeal cavity to be instilled into the lung with the help of an apparatus for endotracheal intubation. This method not only assures lung targeting but also avoids damage and the risk of death in the animals. We expect that this approach will become widely used in the field of acute lung injury.",

      "title": "Implications for the role of lipopolysaccharide in the development of atherosclerosis.",
      "abstract": "Mounting scientific evidence over decades has established that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder. Among the potentially critical sources of vascular inflammation during atherosclerosis are the components of pathogenic bacteria, especially lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, expressed on different inflammatory cells involved with the recognition of bacterial LPS, has been recognized to have mutations that are prevalent in a number of ethnic groups. Such mutations have been associated with a decreased risk of atherosclerosis. In addition, epidemiological investigations have proposed that LPS confers a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. Gram-negative bacteria are the major source of LPS in an individual's serum, which may be generated during subclinical infections. The major cell receptors on inflammatory cells involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, like macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs), are CD14, MD-2, and LPS binding protein (LBP). These receptors have been blamed for the development of atherosclerosis through dysregulated activation following LPS recognition. Lipoproteins may also play a role in modulating the LPS-induced inflammatory events during atherosclerosis development. In this review article, we attempt to clarify the role of LPS in the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic lesion development.",

      "abstract": "Here we review the effects of immune activation primarily via lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, on hippocampal and non-hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Rodent studies have found that LPS alters both the acquisition and consolidation of aversive learning and memory, such as those evoking evolutionarily adaptive responses like fear and disgust. The inhibitory effects of LPS on the acquisition and consolidation of contextual fear memory are discussed. LPS-induced alterations in the acquisition of taste and place-related conditioned disgust memory within bottle preference tasks and taste reactivity tests (taste-related), in addition to conditioned context avoidance tasks and the anticipatory nausea paradigm (place-related), are highlighted. Further, conditioned disgust memory consolidation may also be influenced by LPS-induced effects. Growing evidence suggests a central role of immune activation, especially pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, in eliciting the effects described here. Understanding how infection-induced immune activation alters learning and memory is increasingly important as bacterial and viral infections are found to present a risk of learning and memory impairment.",

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria that reside in the intestines, can be released into circulation and stimulate the immune system, upregulating bone resorption. Exogenous LPS is used in rodent models to study the effect of systemic inflammation on bone, and to date a variety of different doses, routes, and durations of LPS administration have been used. The study objective was to determine whether systemic administration of LPS induced inflammatory bone loss in rodent models. A systematic search of Medline and four other databases resulted in a total of 110 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) with a random-effects meta-analyses were used for bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD).

      "abstract": "Microglial reactivity is a pathological hallmark in many neurodegenerative diseases. During stimulation, microglia undergo complex morphological changes, including loss of their characteristic ramified morphology, which is routinely used to detect and quantify inflammation in the brain. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the relation between microglial morphology and their pathophysiological function are unknown. Here, proteomic profiling of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-reactive microglia identifies microtubule remodeling pathways as an early factor that drives the morphological change and subsequently controls cytokine responses. We find that LPS-reactive microglia reorganize their microtubules to form a stable and centrosomally-anchored array to facilitate efficient cytokine trafficking and release. We identify cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk-1) as a critical upstream regulator of microtubule remodeling and morphological change in-vitro and in-situ. Cdk-1 inhibition also rescues tau and amyloid fibril-induced morphology changes. These results demonstrate a critical role for microtubule dynamics and reorganization in microglial reactivity and modulating cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses.",

      "abstract": "In the lungs, macrophages constitute the first line of defense against pathogens and foreign bodies and play a fundamental role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Activated macrophages show altered immunometabolism and metabolic changes governing immune effector mechanisms, such as cytokine secretion characterizing their classic (M1) or alternative (M2) activation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages demonstrate enhanced glycolysis, blocked succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and increased secretion of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Glycolysis suppression using 2 deoxyglucose in LPS-stimulated macrophages inhibits IL-1β secretion, but not TNF-α, indicating metabolic pathway specificity that determines cytokine production. In contrast to LPS, the nature of the immunometabolic responses induced by non-organic particles, such as silica, in macrophages, its contribution to cytokine specification, and disease pathogenesis are not well understood. Silica-stimulated macrophages activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and NLRP3 inflammasome and release IL-1β, TNF-α, and interferons, which are the key mediators of silicosis pathogenesis. In contrast to bacteria, silica particles cannot be degraded, and the persistent macrophage activation results in an increased NADPH oxidase (Phox) activation and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ultimately leading to macrophage death and release of silica particles that perpetuate inflammation. In this manuscript, we reviewed the effects of silica on macrophage mitochondrial respiration and central carbon metabolism determining cytokine specification responsible for the sustained inflammatory responses in the lungs.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary component of the outer leaflet of Gram-negative bacterial outer membranes. LPS elicits an overwhelming immune response during infection, which can lead to life-threatening sepsis or septic shock for which no suitable treatment is available so far. As a result of the worldwide expanding multidrug-resistant bacteria, the occurrence and frequency of sepsis are expected to increase; thus, there is an urge to develop novel strategies for treating bacterial infections. In this regard, gaining an in-depth understanding about the ability of LPS to both stimulate the host immune system and interact with several molecules is crucial for fighting against LPS-caused infections and allowing for the rational design of novel antisepsis drugs, vaccines and LPS sequestration and detection methods. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which are understood as being a computational microscope, have proven to be of significant value to understand LPS-related phenomena, driving and optimizing experimental research studies. In this work, a comprehensive review on the methods that can be combined with MD simulations, recently applied in LPS research, is provided. We focus especially on both enhanced sampling methods, which enable the exploration of more complex systems and access to larger time scales, and free energy calculation approaches. Thereby, apart from outlining several strategies for surmounting LPS-caused infections, this work reports the current state-of-the-art of the methods applied with MD simulations for moving a step forward in the development of such strategies.",

      "title": "HMGB1 mediates lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage autophagy and pyroptosis.",
      "abstract": "Autophagy and pyroptosis of macrophages play important protective or detrimental roles in sepsis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. High mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) is associated with both pyroptosis and autophagy. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an important pathogenic factor involved in sepsis. Lentivirus-mediated HMGB1 shRNA was used to inhibit the expression of HMGB1. Macrophages were treated with acetylation inhibitor (AA) to suppress the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol. Autophagy and pyroptosis-related protein expressions were detected by Western blot. The levels of caspase-1 activity were detected and the rate of pyroptotic cells was detected by flow cytometry. LPS induced autophagy and pyroptosis of macrophages at different stages, and HMGB1 downregulation decreased LPS-induced autophagy and pyroptosis. Treatment with acetylation inhibitor (anacardic acid) significantly suppressed LPS-induced autophagy, an effect that was not reversed by exogenous HMGB1, suggesting that cytoplasmic HMGB1 mediates LPS-induced autophagy of macrophages. Anacardic acid or an anti-HMGB1 antibody inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis of macrophages. HMGB1 alone induced pyroptosis of macrophages and this effect was inhibited by anti-HMGB1 antibody, suggesting that extracellular HMGB1 induces macrophage pyroptosis and mediates LPS-induced pyroptosis. In summary, HMGB1 plays different roles in mediating LPS-induced autophagy and triggering pyroptosis according to subcellular localization.",

      "abstract": "In today's aging society, dementia is an urgent problem to be solved because no treatment or preventive methods have been established. This review focuses on oral administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria, as a novel preventive drug for dementia. LPS is also called endotoxin and is well known to induce inflammation when administered systemically. On the other hand, although we humans routinely ingest LPS derived from symbiotic bacteria of edible plants, the effect of oral administration of LPS has hardly been studied. Recently, oral administration of LPS was reported to prevent dementia by inducing neuroprotective microglia. Furthermore, it has been suggested that colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) is involved in the dementia prevention mechanism by oral administration of LPS. Thus, in this review, we summarized the previous studies of oral administration of LPS and discussed the predicted dementia prevention mechanism. In addition, we showed the potential of oral LPS administration as a preventive drug for dementia by highlighting research gaps and future issues for clinical application development.",

LPS, an important modulator of innate immune responses ranging from localized inflammation to disseminated sepsis, displays a high level of structural and functional heterogeneity, which arise due to regulated differences in the acylation of the lipid A and the incorporation of non-stoichiometric modiﬁcations in lipid A and the core oligosaccharide.

They exert multiple functions, starting from conferring stability to the bacterial membrane to mediating the interaction of the microbe with the external environment. The composition and the structure of LPSs present tremendous diversity even within bacteria of the same species, and for this reason, the determination of the structure of these molecules is crucial because it can provide information on the motifs key for the virulence of a pathogen or that are associated to a bacterium of the commensal or beneficial microbiota. In addition, structural data disclose the effects triggered from a mutation or from the use of an antibiotic, or they can be used as tools to check the quality of adjuvants and/or medications, as vaccines, that make use of LPS.The structural study of LPSs is complex, and it can be achieved with the right combination of different techniques.

      "title": "Imbalanced M1 and M2 Macrophage Polarization in Bone Marrow Provokes Impairment of the Hematopoietic Microenvironment in a Mouse Model of Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis.",
      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP1/TA-1), but not in senescence-resistant control mice (SAMR1). SAMP1/TA-1 treated with LPS exhibited functional impairment of the hematopoietic microenvironment, which disrupted the dynamics of hematopoiesis. Macrophages are a major component of the bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic microenvironment, which regulates hematopoiesis. Qualitative and quantitative changes in activated macrophages in LPS-treated SAMP1/TA-1 are thought to contribute to the functional deterioration of the hematopoietic microenvironment. Thus, we examined the polarization of pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages, and the dynamics of macrophage production in the BM of SAMP1/TA-1 and SAMR1 after LPS treatment. After LPS treatment, the proportions of M1 and M2 macrophages and the numbers of macrophage progenitor (CFU-M) cells increased in both SAMP1/TA-1 and SAMR1. However, compared to the SAMR1, the increase in the M1 macrophage proportion was prolonged, and the increase in the M2 macrophage proportion was delayed. The increase in the number of CFU-M cells was prolonged in SAMP1/TA-1 after LPS treatment. In addition, the levels of transcripts encoding an M1 macrophage-inducing cytokine (interferon-γ) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor were markedly increased, and the increases in the levels of transcripts encoding M2 macrophage-inducing cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13) were delayed in SAMP1/TA-1 when compared to SAMR1. Our results suggest that LPS treatment led to the severely imbalanced polarization of activated M1/M2 macrophages accompanied by a prolonged increase in macrophage production in the BM of SAMP1/TA-1, which led to the impairment of the hematopoietic microenvironment, and disrupted the dynamics of hematopoiesis.",

We investigated the lipidomic phenotypes of human naı̈ve and stimulated microglia-like cells by atmospheric-pressure scanning microprobe matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (AP-SMALDI MSI). With lateral resolutions between 5 and 1.5 μm pixel size, we were able to chart lipid compositions of individual cells, enabling differentiation of cell lines and stimulation conditions. This allowed us to reveal local lipid heterogeneities in naı̈ve and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells. We were able to identify individual cells with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels and could show that the number of these TG-enriched cells increased with LPS stimulation as a hallmark for a proinflammatory phenotype. Additionally, the observed local abundance alterations of specific phosphatidylinositols (PIs) indicate a cell specific regulation of the PI metabolism.",

      "title": "Extraction, Purification, and Chemical Degradation of LPS from Gut Microbiota Strains.",
      "abstract": "It is estimated that more than 500 different bacterial species colonize the human gut, and they are collectively known as the gut microbiota. Such a massive bacterial presence is now considered an additional organ of the human body, thus becoming the object of an intense and daily growing research activity. Gram-negative bacteria represent a large percentage of the gut microbiota strains. The main constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negatives is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Since its first discovery, LPS has been extensively studied for its structure-dependent capability to elicit a potent immune inflammatory reaction when perceived by specific immune receptors present in our body. Therefore, traditionally, LPS, due to its peculiar chemistry, has been associated with pathogenic bacteria, and it has been extensively studied for its dangerous effects on human health. However, LPS is also expressed on the cell surface of harmless and beneficial bacteria that colonize our intestines. This necessarily implies that the LPS from harmless gut microbes is \"chemically different\" from that owned by pathogenic ones, hence enabling successful colonization of the intestinal tract without creating a threat to the host immune system. Deciphering the structural features of LPS from these gut bacteria is essential to improve our still scarce knowledge of how the human host lives in a harmonious relationship with its own microbiota. To this end, LPS extraction and purification are essential steps in this field of research. Yet working with gut bacteria is extremely complex for a number of reasons, one being related to the fact that they produce an array of other glycans and glycoconjugates, such as capsular polysaccharides and/or exopolysaccharides, which render the isolation and characterization of the sole LPS not at all trivial. Here, we provide a protocol that might help when dealing with LPS from gut microbial species. We describe the preliminary manipulations and checks, extraction, and purification approaches, as well as the necessary chemical manipulations that should be performed to enable the characterization of the structure of an LPS by means of techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.",

Our study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We searched for studies reporting outcomes of lipopolysaccharide application on dental pulp cells in vitro using electronic databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science and Scopus. Having gathered data from 115 papers, we aimed to present all known effects LPS has on different cell types present in dental pulp. We focused on specific receptors and particles that are involved in molecular pathways. Our review provides an essential foundation for further research using in vitro models of pulpitis.",

Neuroinflammation is a prominent feature in the brain in epileptic humans and animal models of epilepsy. However, it remains elusive as to how peripheral inflammation affects epilepsy. Herein we demonstrated significantly greater seizure susceptibility and severity of epilepsy under kainic acid (KA) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mouse model of epilepsy. Nissl staining was employed for assessment of the neuronal damage, immunofluorescence for staining of the microglial cells and astrocytes in the mouse brain slices, and ELISA for detection of the changes of inflammatory factors. We observed a smaller population of viable neurons in CA1 and CA3 regions, a greater population of IBA-1-positive and GFAP-positive cells, with a significant upregulation of IL-1β and IL-6 in hippocampus of epileptic mice when treated with LPS, indicating that LPS aggravates hippocampal neuron injury in epilepsy, and induces neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.

      "abstract": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a pattern recognition receptor, is activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and induces the MyD88 pathway, which subsequently produces pro-inflammatory cytokines through activation of transcriptional nuclear factor (NF)-κB. Statins have been widely prescribed to reduce cholesterol synthesis for patients with cardiovascular disease. Statins may have pleiotropic effects, which include anti- and pro-inflammatory effects on cells. The molecular mechanism of the sequential influence of LPS and statin on the innate immune system remains unknown. We employed affinity purification-spacer-arm controlled cross-linking (AP-SPACC) MS-based proteomics analysis to identify the LPS- and statin-LPS-responsive proteins and their networks. LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage cells singly and combined with the drug statin used in this study. Two chemical cross-linkers with different spacer chain lengths were utilized to stabilize the weak and transient interactors. Proteomic analysis identified 1631 differentially expressed proteins. We identified 151 immune-response proteins through functional enrichment analysis and visualized their interaction networks. Selected candidate protein-coding genes were validated, specifically squamous cell carcinoma antigens recognized by T cells 3, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, Ras-related protein Rab-35, and tumor protein D52 protein-coding genes through transcript-level expression analysis. The expressions of those genes were significantly increased upon statin treatment and decreased in LPS-stimulated macrophage cells. Therefore, we presumed that the expression changes of genes occurred due to immune response during activation of inflammation. These results highlight the immune-responsive proteins network, providing a new platform for novel investigations and discovering future therapeutic targets for inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation is linked to motivational deficits seen in depression and other disorders. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces an inflammatory response and impairs motivated behavior in humans and rodents. It has been suggested that inflammation can shift metabolic needs to functions that warrant more response to the perceived threat (e.g., fighting infection), therefore altering aspects of motivation. Animal models have been developed to assess alterations in motivated behavior by giving the animal the option to work (i.e., lever press) for a highly palatable food reward vs. approaching and consuming a freely available, albeit less preferred, food. This model was used to determine if administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), a substance that inhibits glucose uptake and glycolysis, could reverse the motivational deficits induced by LPS in rats. A food preference/intake task was also conducted to see if LPS affected intake of the highly palatable vs. less palatable foods when both are freely available. It was hypothesized that 2-DG would reverse the motivational deficits caused by LPS and there would be no effect on food preference/intake of the highly palatable food. Results showed that 2-DG significantly reversed LPS effects at the lowest dose, while methylphenidate did not. The food intake/preference tests showed that LPS significantly decreased food intake of both foods but did not alter preference for the highly palatable food compared to vehicle. These results suggest that in addition to having effects on exertion of effort during instrumental behavior, LPS also has direct effects on primary food motivation.",

      "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is regarded to be a key mediator in cerebral diseases with attendant cognitive decline. Ferroptosis, characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, participates in neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have revealed insulin's neuroprotective effects and involvement in the regulation of numerous central functions. But the effect of insulin on cognitive impairment induced by neuroinflammation has been rarely explored. In this study, we constructed a cognitive impairment model by intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a single dosage of insulin was mixed in the LPS solution to explore the potential mechanisms through which insulin treatment could improve LPS-induced cognitive dysfunction. At 24 h after treatment, we found that insulin treatment significantly improved LPS-induced cognitive decline, neuronal injuries, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Insulin treatment could also inhibit the LPS-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes, and the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the hippocampus. Furthermore, insulin treatment inhibited LPS-induced ferroptosis in the hippocampus by decreasing iron accumulation levels, regulating ferroptosis-related proteins including transferrin, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ferritin heavy chin 1 (FTH1) and cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT), inhibiting oxidative stress injuries and lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our finding that insulin treatment could alleviate LPS-induced cognitive impairment by inhibiting neuroinflammation and ferroptosis provides a new potential therapeutic method to ameliorate cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are the main components of the external leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane and consist of three different moieties: lipid A, core oligosaccharide, and O-polysaccharide. The lipid A is a glucosamine disaccharide with different levels of acylation and phosphorylation, beside carrying, in certain cases, additional substituents on the sugar backbone. It is also the main immunostimulatory part of the LPS, as its recognition by the host immune system represents a fundamental event for detection of perilous microorganisms. Moreover, an uncontrolled immune response caused by a large amount of circulating LPS can lead to dramatic outcomes for human health, such as septic shock. The immunostimulant properties of an LPS incredibly vary depending on lipid A chemical structure, and for this reason, natural and synthetic variants of the lipid A are under study to develop new drugs that mimic or antagonise its natural effects. Here, we review past and recent findings on the lipid A as an antibiotic target and immune-therapeutic molecule, with a special attention on the crucial role of the chemical structure and its exploitation for conceiving novel strategies for treatment of several immune-related pathologies.",

Here, we studied the role of mouse CRAMP in bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. CRAMP peptide treatment significantly inhibited LPS-mediated inflammatory activation of glial cells in culture. In the animal model of LPS-induced neuroinflammation, CRAMP expression was highly induced in multiple cell types, such as astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Injection of exogenous CRAMP peptide significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression and the reactivity of glial cells in the mouse brain following intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular LPS administration. Altogether, results of the study suggest that CRAMP plays an important part in containment of LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses, and that CRAMP can be exploited for the development of targeted therapies for neuroinflammatory conditions associated with bacterial infection.",

      "title": "Utilization of Isoflavones in Soybeans for Women with Menopausal Syndrome: An Overview.",
      "abstract": "Based on their nutrient composition, soybeans and related foods have been considered to be nutritious and healthy for humans. Particularly, the biological activity and subsequent benefits of soy products may be associated with the presence of isoflavone in soybeans. As an alternative treatment for menopause-related symptoms, isoflavone has gained much popularity for postmenopausal women who have concerns related to undergoing hormone replacement therapy. However, current research has still not reached a consensus on the effects of isoflavone on humans. This overview is a summary of the current literature about the processing of soybeans and isoflavone types (daidzein, genistein, and S-equol) and supplements and their extraction and analysis as well as information about the utilization of isoflavones in soybeans. The processes of preparation (cleaning, drying, crushing and dehulling) and extraction of soybeans are implemented to produce refined soy oil, soy lecithin, free fatty acids, glycerol and soybean meal. The remaining components consist of inorganic constituents (minerals) and the minor components of biologically interesting small molecules. Regarding the preventive effects on diseases or cancers, a higher intake of isoflavones is associated with a moderately lower risk of developing coronary heart disease. It may also reduce the risks of breast and colorectal cancer as well as the incidence of breast cancer recurrence. Consumption of isoflavones or soy foods is associated with reduced risks of endometrial and bladder cancer. Regarding the therapeutic effects on menopausal syndrome or other diseases, isoflavones have been found to alleviate vasomotor syndromes even after considering placebo effects, reduce bone loss in the spine and ameliorate hypertension and in vitro glycemic control. They may also alleviate depressive symptoms during pregnancy. On the other hand, isoflavones have not shown definitive effects regarding improving cognition and urogenital symptoms. Because of lacking standardization in the study designs, such as the ingredients and doses of isoflavones and the durations and outcomes of trials, it currently remains difficult to draw overall conclusions for all aspects of isoflavones. These limitations warrant further investigations of isoflavone use for women's health.",

Detailed, early-life longitudinal questionnaires captured infection and antibiotic events, stress, prenatal factors, family history, and more. Biomarkers including cord serum metabolome and lipidome, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype, infant microbiota, and stool metabolome were assessed. Among the 16,440 Swedish children followed across time, 1,197 developed an ND. Significant associations emerged for future ND diagnosis in general and for specific ND subtypes, spanning intellectual disability, speech disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism. This investigation revealed microbiome connections to future diagnosis as well as early emerging mood and gastrointestinal problems. The findings suggest links to immunodysregulation and metabolism, compounded by stress, early-life infection, and antibiotics. The convergence of infant biomarkers and risk factors in this prospective, longitudinal study on a large-scale population establishes a foundation for early-life prediction and intervention in neurodevelopment.",

      "title": "Menopause and the Skin: Old Favorites and New Innovations in Cosmeceuticals for Estrogen-Deficient Skin.",
      "abstract": "Estrogen is a pivotal signaling molecule; its production is regulated by the expression of the aromatase (CYP19A1) gene from ovarian and peripheral tissue sites, and it is transmitted via estrogen receptors to influence many important biological functions. However, the narrative for this overview focuses on the decline of 17β-estradiol levels from ovarian sites after menopause. This estrogen-deficient condition is associated with a dramatic reduction in skin health and wellness by negatively impacting dermal cellular and homeostatic mechanisms, as well as other important biological functions. The changes include loss of collagen, elastin, fibroblast function, vascularity, and increased matrix metalloproteinase(s) enzymatic activities, resulting in cellular and extracellular degradation that leads to dryness, wrinkles, atrophy, impaired wound healing/barrier function, decreased antioxidant capacity [i.e., defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress], decreased attractiveness and psychological health, and increased perception of aging. While topical estrogen may reverse these changes, the effects of today's low-dose systemic hormone treatments are not well established, raising the need for more concentrated local administration of hormones or newer cosmeceutical agents such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including phytoestrogens that have become major active ingredients for skin care products, especially when addressing estrogen-deficient skin. Two example compounds are presented, an analog of resveratrol (i.e., 4'-acetoxy resveratrol) and the isoflavonoid equol, both of which are involved in a variety of biochemical/molecular actions and mechanisms, as demonstrated via in vitro and clinical studies that enhance human dermal health, especially in estrogen-deficient skin.",

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiota regulates estrogen metabolism through the \"estrobolome,\" the collection of bacterial genes that encode enzymes like β-glucuronidases and β-glucosidases. These enzymes deconjugate and reactivate estrogen, influencing circulating levels. The estrobolome mediates the enterohepatic circulation and bioavailability of estrogen. Alterations in gut microbiota composition and estrobolome function have been associated with estrogen-related diseases like breast cancer, enometrial cancer, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This is likely due to dysregulated estrogen signaling partly contributed by the microbial impacts on estrogen metabolism. Dietary phytoestrogens also undergo bacterial metabolism into active metabolites like equol, which binds estrogen receptors and exhibits higher estrogenic potency than its precursor daidzein. However, the ability to produce equol varies across populations, depending on the presence of specific gut microbes. Characterizing the estrobolome and equol-producing genes across populations can provide microbiome-based biomarkers. Further research is needed to investigate specific components of the estrobolome, phytoestrogen-microbiota interactions, and mechanisms linking dysbiosis to estrogen-related pathology. However, current evidence suggests that the gut microbiota is an integral regulator of estrogen status with clinical relevance to women's health and hormonal disorders.",

      "abstract": "The metabolites produced by the gut microbiota have been reported as crucial agents against obesity; however, their key targets have not been revealed completely in complex microbiome systems. Hence, the aim of this study was to decipher promising prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, and more importantly, key target(s) via a network pharmacology approach. First, we retrieved the metabolites related to gut microbes from the gutMGene database. Then, we performed a meta-analysis to identify metabolite-related targets via the similarity ensemble approach (SEA) and SwissTargetPrediction (STP), and obesity-related targets were identified by DisGeNET and OMIM databases. After selecting the overlapping targets, we adopted topological analysis to identify core targets against obesity. Furthermore, we employed the integrated networks to microbiota-substrate-metabolite-target (MSMT) via R Package. Finally, we performed a molecular docking test (MDT) to verify the binding affinity between metabolite(s) and target(s) with the Autodock 1.5.6 tool. Based on holistic viewpoints, we performed a filtering step to discover the core targets through topological analysis. Then, we implemented protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks with 342 overlapping target, another subnetwork was constructed with the top 30% degree centrality (DC), and the final core networks were obtained after screening the top 30% betweenness centrality (BC). The final core targets were IL6, AKT1, and ALB. We showed that the three core targets interacted with three other components via the MSMT network in alleviating obesity, i.e., four microbiota, two substrates, and six metabolites. The MDT confirmed that equol (postbiotics) converted from isoflavone (prebiotics) via ",

      "abstract": "Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds that have chemical structures and functions similar to estrogen. Phytoestrogens act as ligand-inducible transcription factors involved in cellular growth by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), specifically ER alpha (ERα) and beta (ERβ). Through this mechanism, phytoestrogens have a physiological function similar to that of the female hormone 17β-estradiol (E2), which can be useful in treating osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Furthermore, phytoestrogens have been found to elicit various cellular responses depending on their affinity for ERs; in particular, they show a greater affinity with for ERβ. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the mode of action of eight phytoestrogens, namely kaempferol, coumestrol, glycitein, apigenin, daidzein, genistein, equol, and resveratrol, by evaluating their estrogenic activity as ER ligands. Based on the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based ER dimerization and transactivation assay results, all the phytoestrogens tested were identified as estrogen agonists by mediating ERα and ERβ dimerization. The specific binding and functions of ERα and ERβ were distinguished by differentiating between their dimerization activity. In addition, this study contributes to advancing our understanding of the overall mechanism of action involving both ERs.",

      "abstract": "Choriocarcinoma is a malignant cancer that belongs to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). Herein, serum metabolomic analysis was performed on 29 GTN patients and 30 healthy individuals to characterize the metabolic variations during GTN progression. Ultimately 24 differential metabolites (DMs) were identified, of which, Equol was down-regulated in GTN patients, whose VIP score is the 3rd highest among the 24 DMs. As an intestinal metabolite of daidzein, the anticancer potential of Equol has been demonstrated in multiple cancers, but not choriocarcinoma. Hence, human choriocarcinoma cell lines JEG-3 and Bewo were used and JEG-3-derived subcutaneous xenograft models were developed to assess the effect of Equol on choriocarcinoma. The results suggested that Equol treatment effectively suppressed choriocarcinoma cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis, and reduced tumorigenesis. Label-free quantitative proteomics showed that 136 proteins were significantly affected by Equol and 20 proteins were enriched in Gene Ontology terms linked to protein degradation. Tripartite motif containing 21 (TRIM21), a E3 ubiquitin ligase, was up-regulated by Equol. Equol-induced effects on choriocarcinoma cells could be reversed by TRIM21 inhibition. Annexin A2 (ANXA2) interacted with TRIM21 and its ubiquitination was modulated by TRIM21. We found that TRIM21 was responsible for proteasome-mediated degradation of ANXA2 induced by Equol, and the inhibitory effects of Equol on the malignant behaviors of choriocarcinoma cells were realized by TRIM21-mediated down-regulation of ANXA2. Moreover, β-catenin activation was inhibited by Equol, which also depended on TRIM21-mediated down-regulation of ANXA2. Taken together, Equol may be a novel candidate for the treatment for choriocarcinoma.",

      "title": "Current Perspectives on the Beneficial Effects of Soybean Isoflavones and Their Metabolites for Humans.",
      "abstract": "Soybeans are rich in proteins and lipids and have become a staple part of the human diet. Besides their nutritional excellence, they have also been shown to contain various functional components, including isoflavones, and have consequently received increasing attention as a functional food item. Isoflavones are structurally similar to 17-β-estradiol and bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). The estrogenic activity of isoflavones ranges from a hundredth to a thousandth of that of estrogen itself. Isoflavones play a role in regulating the effects of estrogen in the human body, depending on the situation. Thus, when estrogen is insufficient, isoflavones perform the functions of estrogen, and when estrogen is excessive, isoflavones block the estrogen receptors to which estrogen binds, thus acting as an estrogen antagonist. In particular, estrogen antagonistic activity is important in the breast, endometrium, and prostate, and such antagonistic activity suppresses cancer occurrence. Genistein, an isoflavone, has cancer-suppressing effects on estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers, including breast cancer. It suppresses the function of enzymes such as tyrosine protein kinase, mitogen-activated kinase, and DNA polymerase II, thus inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Genistein is the most biologically active and potent isoflavone candidate for cancer prevention. Furthermore, among the various physiological functions of isoflavones, they are best known for their antioxidant activities. ",

      "title": "Prostate diseases and microbiome in the prostate, gut, and urine.",
      "abstract": "The microbiome in various organs involves a vast network that plays a key role in the health and wellness of the human body. With recent advances in biological technologies such as high-throughput sequencing, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, it appears that the microbial signature varies dynamically among individuals, creating various roles in metabolism, local and systemic inflammation, and host immunity. Urinary and genital organs, including the prostate, seminal vesicles, and urinary bladder, are reservoirs of several bacterial, viral, and fungal communities. Accumulating evidence has suggested profound roles for the gut, urinary, and intraprostate microbiomes in genitourinary benign and malignant diseases. This review article addresses microbiome-related evidence for three major diseases involved in prostate cancer: chronic prostatitis (CP), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer (PCa). Symptomatic CP is known as CP/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. CP is one of the most common prostate diseases in young men, accounting for 8% of all men visiting a urologic clinic. Although oral medication is the gold standard therapy for patients with BPH, approximately 13% of men present with clinical progression within 4 years after the initiation of treatment, with 5% requiring surgical intervention. The identification of proinflammatory cytokines and pathogens responsible for the clinical progression of BPH is still underway. Several topics regarding the association between PCa and the microbiome are discussed in this review as follows: i) intraprostatic microbiome and the risk of PCa, ii) gut microbiome and PCa, iii) gut microbiome and the risk of radiation-induced side effects, iv) isoflavone intake and equol-producing intestinal flora on PCa, and v) the inhibitory effect of daidzein and equol on tumor growth and progression of PCa. Further studies are required for a comprehensive understanding between the urogenital microbiome and prostate pathogenesis to facilitate the development of preventive and therapeutic approaches for prostate diseases.",

      "abstract": "An increasing number of studies have shown that the consumption of soybeans and soybeans products is beneficial to human health, and the biological activity of soy products may be attributed to the presence of Soy Isoflavones (SI) in soybeans. In the intestinal tracts of humans and animals, certain specific bacteria can metabolize soy isoflavones into equol. Equol has a similar chemical structure to endogenous estradiol in the human body, which can bind with estrogen receptors and exert weak estrogen effects. Therefore, equol plays an important role in the occurrence and development of a variety of hormone-dependent malignancies such as breast cancer and prostate cancer. Despite the numerous health benefits of equol for humans, only 30-50% of the population can metabolize soy isoflavones into equol, with individual variation in gut microbiota being the main reason. This article provides an overview of the relevant gut microbiota involved in the synthesis of equol and its anti-tumor effects in various types of cancer. It also summarizes the molecular mechanisms underlying its anti-tumor properties, aiming to provide a more reliable theoretical basis for the rational utilization of equol in the field of cancer treatment.",

Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of daidzein for the control of animal and human female reproductive processes, and how to make this application more efficient. The existing literature demonstrates the influence of daidzein and its metabolite equol on various nonreproductive and reproductive processes and their disorders. Daidzein and equol can both up- and downregulate the ovarian reception of gonadotropins, healthy and cancerous ovarian-cell proliferation, apoptosis, viability, ovarian growth, follicullo- and oogenesis, and follicular atresia. These effects could be mediated by daidzein and equol on hormone production and reception, reactive oxygen species, and intracellular regulators of proliferation and apoptosis. Both the stimulatory and the inhibitory effects of daidzein and equol could be useful for reproductive stimulation, the prevention and mitigation of cancer development, and the adverse effects of environmental stressors in reproductive biology and medicine.",

      "abstract": "Soybean is the most economically important legume globally, providing a major source of plant protein for millions of people; it offers a high-quality, cost-competitive and versatile base-protein ingredient for plant-based meat alternatives. The health benefits of soybean and its constituents have largely been attributed to the actions of phytoestrogens, which are present at high levels. Additionally, consumption of soy-based foods may also modulate gastrointestinal (GI) health, in particular colorectal cancer risk, via effects on the composition and metabolic activity of the GI microbiome. The aim of this narrative review was to critically evaluate the emerging evidence from clinical trials, observational studies and animal trials relating to the effects of consuming soybeans, soy-based products and the key constituents of soybeans (isoflavones, soy proteins and oligosaccharides) on measures of GI health. Our review suggests that there are consistent favourable changes in measures of GI health for some soy foods, such as fermented rather than unfermented soy milk, and for those individuals with a microbiome that can metabolise equol. However, as consumption of foods containing soy protein isolates and textured soy proteins increases, further clinical evidence is needed to understand whether these foods elicit similar or additional functional effects on GI health.",

      "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that regular intake of soy isoflavone exerts a preventive effect on postmenopausal obesity and other forms of dysmetabolism. Estrogens inhibit eating behavior. Soy isoflavones may act as estrogen agonist in estrogen-depleted conditions, whereas they may either act as an estrogen antagonist or be ineffective in estrogen-repleted conditions. We investigated the effects of dietary soy isoflavone on food intake under various estrogen conditions using male, ovariectomized (OVX), and non-OVX female rats, and compared the effects with those of estradiol. We found that soy isoflavones reduced food intake in females specifically, regardless of whether ovariectomy had been performed, whereas subcutaneous implantation of estradiol pellet did not reduce food intake in intact female rats, but did so in OVX female and male rats. Contrary to this hypothesis, the reduction in food intake may not be caused by the estrogenic properties of soy isoflavones. It is of great interest to understand the mechanisms underlying the anorectic effects of soy isoflavones. In this non-systematic review, we summarize our recent studies that have investigated the bioactive substances of anorectic action, pharmacokinetic properties of soy isoflavones, and the modification of central and peripheral signals regulating appetite by soy isoflavones, and selected studies that were identified via database mining.",

After treatment with 40 μg/mL equol, cell proliferation, cell migration, and colony formation of HCT116 colon cancer cells were inhibited. Network pharmacology and transcriptomics analysis revealed the downregulation of genes related to DNA replication (CCND1, E2F1, CDC6, CDC45, MCM4), leading to G1/S cell cycle arrest and the induction of cell apoptosis, which was confirmed by flow cytometry. Genes associated with the G2-to-M transition (CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1) were also downregulated. In addition, equol downregulated genes (FOXM1 and ASPM) that control cell migration and invasion. Our data indicate that equol can inhibit colorectal cancer by targeting multiple pathways, suggesting its potential as a key component in the adjuvant treatment of colorectal cancer.",

      "title": "Polyphenols in Ruminant Nutrition and Their Effects on Reproduction.",
      "abstract": "The feeding of domestic animals with diets in which polyphenols are present is increasingly attracting the attention of nutritionists and scientists. This review summarizes the knowledge regarding polyphenols' possible positive and negative effects and their bioavailability. The bioavailability of substances is a prerequisite for any postabsorption effect in vivo. Positive and negative properties have been confirmed in previous studies on the diets of domestic animals rich in polyphenols, such as secondary metabolites of plants. Free radicals are formed in every organism, leading to oxidative stress. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules and can react in cells with macromolecules and can cause damage, including in reproductive cells. Some polyphenols at specific concentrations have antioxidant properties that positively affect animal reproduction by improving the quality of male and female gametes. The intake of phytoestrogens that mimic estrogen function can induce various pathological conditions in the female reproductive tract, including ovarian, fallopian, and uterine dysfunction. The metabolism of genistein and daidzein yields the metabolites equol and p-phenyl-phenol, leading to a decline in cow fertilization. The findings so far confirm that numerous questions still need to be answered. This review points out the importance of using polyphenols that have both benificial and some unfavorable properties in specific diets.",

      "abstract": "Equol is an isoflavone produced by intestinal microbiota from daidzein. It has been assumed that individuals with equol-producing microbiota are those who mainly benefit from isoflavone consumption. However, no obvious genotypic differences can be found between the microbiota of equol-producing individuals and non-equol-producing individuals. The aim of this work was to find phenotypic differences in isoflavone metabolism between equol-producing and non-equol-producing intestinal microbiota. Of the 17 faecal samples used in this work, six produced equol from both daidzein and dihydrodaidzein (DHD); however, only equol-producing faecal samples produced 5-hydroxy-equol from genistein and dihydrogenistein (DHG). The equol producing microbiota metabolised most of daidzein, genistein, DHD and DHG present in the medium, while the metabolism of daidzein and genistein by non-equol producing microbiota is much lower, and they do not metabolise DHD and DHG. Moreover, equol-producing faecal samples produced lower concentrations of O-DMA than the non-equol-producing faecal samples. In addition, we demonstrated that most of the O-DMA is produced from daidzein. Therefore, there are important phenotypic differences between equol-producing and non-equol-producing intestinal microbiota, and these differences explain the differentiation between equol-producing and non-equol-producing individuals, and help to understand the metabolism of isoflavones by microbiota and how intestinal microbiota is responsible for the benefits of isoflavone intake.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a common pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, and end-organ dysfunction. However, to date, no effective treatment has been established other than iatrogenic delivery, and the importance of prevention as an alternative approach to addressing PE has been emphasized. There is growing evidence on the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological prophylaxis in preventing PE. In this review, we focused on dietary supplements as non-pharmacological prophylaxis for PE. Calcium is a well-documented supplement for the prevention of PE. Daily 500 mg calcium supplementation can roughly halve the risk of PE in settings where calcium intake is low, including in Japan. According to recent systematic reviews and network meta-analyses, current evidence on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation is inconsistent. Although vitamin D is a candidate for the prevention of PE, future large-scale randomized control trials are necessary to draw definitive conclusions. We also reviewed other dietary supplements, including vitamins (vitamins A, B6, C, and E, folic acid, and multivitamins), minerals (magnesium, zinc, and iron), amino acids (l-arginine and l-carnitine), anti-oxidants (lycopene, resveratrol, and astaxanthin), and other agents (omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, melatonin, and s-equol). In this study, we provide a comprehensive approach to help develop better preventive strategies and ultimately reduce the burden of PE.",

      "abstract": "The overarching theme for this review is perspective. Superfoods (a marketing term for fruits and vegetables, etc.) have a positive connotation, while many superfoods contain phytoestrogens, a term that is alarming to the public and has a negative connotation because phytoestrogens are endocrine-disruptors, even though they are strong antioxidants that have many health benefits. To understand phytoestrogens, this paper provides a brief summary of the characteristics of: (a) estrogens, (b) estrogen receptors (ER), (c) estrogen-deficient skin, (d) how perspective(s) get off track, (e) phytoestrogen food sources, and (f) misconceptions of phytoestrogens and food safety, in general, that influence person(s) away from what is true. Finally, a brief history of cosmetics to nutraceuticals is covered plus the characteristics of phytoestrogens, resveratrol and equol on: (g) estrogen receptor binding, (h) topical and oral dosing, and (i) in vitro, molecular mechanisms and select clinical evidence, where both phytoestrogens (resveratrol and equol) demonstrate promising applications to improve skin health is presented along with future directions of nutraceuticals. Perspective is paramount in understanding the controversies associated with superfoods, phytoestrogens, and endocrine-disruptors because they have both positive and negative connotations. Everyone is exposed to and consumes these molecules everyday regardless of age, gender, or geographic location around the world, and how we understand this is a matter of perspective.",

      "abstract": "The human gut is a host for trillions of microorganisms, divided into more than 3,000 heterogeneous species that is called the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota composition can be altered by many different endogenous and exogenous factors, especially diet and nutrition. A diet rich in phytoestrogens, a variable group of chemical compounds similar to 17-β-estradiol (E2), the essential female steroid sex hormone is potent to change the composition of gut microbiota. However, the metabolism of phytoestrogens also highly depends on the action of enzymes produced by gut microbiota. Novel studies have shown that phytoestrogens could play an important role in the treatment of different types of cancers, such as breast cancer in women, due to their potential to decrease estrogen levels. This review aims to summarize recent findings about the lively dialogue between phytoestrogens and gut microbiota and to address their possible future application, especially in treating patients with diagnosed breast cancer. A potential therapeutic approach for the prevention and improving outcomes in breast cancer patients could be based on targeted probiotic supplementation with the use of soy phytoestrogens. A positive effect of probiotics on the outcome and survival of patients with breast cancer has been established. However, more in vivo scientific studies are needed to pave the way for the use of probiotics and phytoestrogens in the clinical practice of breast cancer treatment.",

      "title": "Quantitative assessment of urinary equol levels, equol-producing bacteria, and the faecal microbiota in healthy Japanese individuals.",
      "abstract": "Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) has attracted considerable attention for its potential efficacy in treating hormonal diseases. In this study we collected samples from healthy Japanese individuals (n = 91) to observe the relationship between the abundance of equol-producing bacteria in their faeces and the concentration of equol in their urine. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting the dihydrodaidzein reductase gene (dhdr) was used to detect equol-producing bacteria. Equol producers, who were defined as individuals with >1000 nmol/l equol in their urine, exhibited 4-8 log10 copies of dhdr/g faeces of equol-producing bacteria. We assessed the accuracy of these findings by determining the rate of correspondence between possessing equol-producing bacteria and producing urinary equol. Of the 91 participants, 33 were found to be positive for both equol-producing bacteria and urinary equol, 52 were negative for both, one was positive for equol-producing bacteria and negative for urinary equol, and five were negative for equol-producing bacteria and positive for urinary equol. The sensitivity and specificity of the qPCR for detecting equol-producing bacteria were 86.8% and 98.1%, respectively. On the whole, the presence of equol-producing bacteria and urinary equol displayed 93.4% concordance, with a kappa coefficient of 0.862. No apparent correlation was observed between dhdr copy number in the faeces and urinary equol concentrations. Analysis of the faecal microbiota showed that alpha diversity indices (OTU, ACE, Chao1, Shannon) were significantly higher in equol producers. Specifically, the relative abundance of phylum Pseudomonadota was increased in non-equol producers, while abundance of genus Alistipes, Barnesiella, Butyricimonas, Odoribacter, and Ruminococcus, which produce short chain fatty acids and/or hydrogen, were only observed in equol producers. These results suggest that a certain amount of equol-producing bacteria must be present in the intestine to produce detectable levels of equol, and that equol productivity might be affected by other components of the microbiota.",

      "abstract": "S-equol, a metabolite of soy isoflavone daidzein transformed by the gut microbiome, is the most biologically potent among all soy isoflavones and their metabolites. Soy isoflavones are phytoestrogens and exert their actions through estrogen receptor-β. Epidemiological studies in East Asia, where soy isoflavones are regularly consumed, show that dietary isoflavone intake is inversely associated with cognitive decline and dementia; however, randomized controlled trials of soy isoflavones in Western countries did not generally show their cognitive benefit. The discrepant results may be attributed to S-equol production capability; after consuming soy isoflavones, 40-70% of East Asians produce S-equol, whereas 20-30% of Westerners do. Recent observational and clinical studies in Japan show that S-equol but not soy isoflavones is inversely associated with multiple vascular pathologies, contributing to cognitive impairment and dementia, including arterial stiffness and white matter lesion volume. S-equol has better permeability to the blood-brain barrier than soy isoflavones, although their affinity to estrogen receptor-β is similar. S-equol is also the most potent antioxidant among all known soy isoflavones. Although S-equol is available as a dietary supplement, no long-term trials in humans have examined the effect of S-equol supplementation on arterial stiffness, cerebrovascular disease, cognitive decline, or dementia.",

      "title": "Production of Bovine Equol-Enriched Milk: A Review.",
      "abstract": "Milk and dairy products are important sources of nutrients in the human diet because they contain a number of essential substances and other biologically active components. Many of these substances can be modified, and thus offer opportunities to use milk and dairy products as functional food. Isoflavones are particularly important in human nutrition due to their diverse pharmacological and antioxidant properties. The clinical effectiveness of isoflavone-rich products is believed to be dependent on their ability to metabolize daidzein to equol, which may directly exert cancer preventive effects. However, only approximately 30-40% of humans are able to produce equol, while animals, in general, produce equol. Equol is the predominant product of bacterial metabolism of isoflavones and can be found in various amounts in some food of animal origin, especially in milk. Therefore, milk and dairy products can be considered to be sources of equol for humans who are not able to produce this metabolite. When the content of isoflavones in milk is to be modified, two groups of factors should be considered, i.e., dietary factors that include the source of isoflavones and the processing effects on feedstuffs and animal factors that include the intake of isoflavones, ruminal and postruminal changes, and the health and physiological status of animals. The approximate content of isoflavones in milk can be predicted using carry-over rates for different dietary sources or using a formula that describes the relationship between equol concentration in milk and formononetin intake. Processing and storage can affect the content and profile of isoflavones in milk and dairy products.",

This review is focused on how equol affects breast cancer, as evidenced by in vivo and in vitro studies. Equol is considered chemoprotective in specific endocrine-related pathologies, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and menopausal symptoms. In humans, not everyone can produce equol from gut metabolism. It is postulated that equol producers benefit more than non-equol producers for all the endocrine-related effects.

      "abstract": "Equol is a metabolite of daidzein, a major soybean isoflavone with estrogenic and antioxidant activities. As the production of equol depends on the presence of certain members of the intestinal microflora, not all individuals can produce equol. We examined the relationship between NASH histological features and equol production. In an animal model, obese OLETF rats were intraperitoneally injected with a porcine serum to augment liver fibrogenesis. Equol-rich soy product, SE5-OH was orally administered during the experimental period. Treatment with SE5-OH markedly attenuated the development of liver fibrosis and expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin. In clinical research, 38 NAFLD patients (13 men and 25 women) were included. The degree of fibrosis and ballooning in equol-nonproducers was significantly higher than in equol-producers in women. The percentage of nonproducers with NAFLD activity score (NAS) ≥ 5 was significantly higher than that of producers. None of the histological features were significantly different between nonproducers and producers in men. Decision tree analysis identified predictors for NAS ≥ 5 in women. The status of equol production was the strongest predictor, followed by fasting glucose. Since equol can be noninvasively detected in urine, it can be applied as a screening tool for the progression of NASH in women.",

      "abstract": "Isoflavones are naturally occurring compounds found in a wide range of plants, but among commonly consumed foods are especially abundant in soybeans and foods derived from this legume. Much of the substantial amount of research conducted on soy protein and soy foods over the past 30 y is because of their isoflavone content. Research interest in isoflavones increased dramatically beginning in the early 1990s as evidence highlighted their possible role in the prevention of a wide range of cancers, including breast, prostate, and colon cancer. Recognition that isoflavones preferentially bind to estrogen receptor (ER)β in comparison with ERα provided a conceptual basis for classifying these diphenolic molecules as selective ER modulators (SERMs). Isoflavone research soon greatly expanded beyond cancer to include areas such as coronary artery disease, bone health, cognitive function, and vasomotor symptoms of menopause. Nevertheless, safety concerns about isoflavones, based primarily on the results of rodent studies and presumed estrogenic effects, also arose. However, recent work challenges the traditional view of the estrogenicity of isoflavones. Furthermore, safety concerns have largely been refuted by intervention and population studies. On the other hand, investigation of the proposed benefits of isoflavones has produced inconsistent data. The small sample size and short duration common to many intervention trials, combined with marked interindividual differences in isoflavone metabolism, likely contribute to the conflicting findings. Also, many different intervention products have been employed, which vary not only in the total amount, but also in the relative proportion of the 3 soybean isoflavones, and the form in which they are delivered (glycoside compared with aglycone). For those interested in exploring the proposed benefits of isoflavones, studies justify an intake recommendation of ∼50 mg/d, an amount provided by ∼2 servings of traditional Asian soy foods.",

      "abstract": "Equol, a naturally occurring phytoestrogen derived from the fermentation of soy and soy-based products by gut bacteria, is recognized for its diverse health benefits. While there is speculation about its association with cancer prevention, the scientific community has yet to reach a consensus due to the variability in research findings. Our study aims to shed light on this topic by examining the correlation between urine equol concentrations and the cancer risk among the American population. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a national survey of U.S. civilians in which cancer participants are enrolled in a database by a sample questionnaire. This study included 2797 Americans aged 40 years and older in the NHANES database (2005-2010). The relationship between urine equol concentration and cancer was analysed using weighted logistic regression models, stratified analysis, smoothed curve fitting and threshold effect analysis were also performed. Among the 2797 participants in our study, 390 individuals received a cancer diagnosis. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between urine equol levels and the risk of cancer. Notably, individuals in the highest quartile of equol excretion exhibited a significantly elevated risk of cancer, with a 25.4% increase compared to those in the lowest quartile (POR = 1.254, 95% CI: 1.252, 1.256), after fully adjusting for confounders. Similar results were observed in other adjusted models. A non-linear relationship in the shape of an inverted U-shape can be observed by smoothed curve fitting, and the inflection point is 25.5. Urinary equol concentrations below 25.5 ng/ml were positively associated with cancer risk, while equol concentrations above 25.5 ng/ml showed a slight negative trend in cancer risk. However, further prospective studies are needed to provide more robust evidence and confirmed in large clinical trials.",

The isoflavone daidzein and its intestinal metabolite equol are bioactive phytoestrogens and potent agonists of estrogen receptors.

In humans, polyphenols are associated with various health benefits, particularly in cardiometabolic health. Despite growing evidence of polyphenols' health-promoting effects, their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to high interindividual variability in bioavailability and metabolism. Recent research highlights the bidirectional relationship between dietary polyphenols and the gut microbiota, which can influence polyphenol metabolism and, conversely, be modulated by polyphenol intake. In this concise review, we summarized recent advances in this area, with a special focus on isoflavones and ellagitannins and their corresponding metabotypes, and their effect on cardiovascular health. Human observational studies published in the past 10 years provide evidence for a consistent association of isoflavones and ellagitannins and their metabotypes with better cardiovascular risk factors. However, interventional studies with dietary polyphenols or isolated microbial metabolites indicate that the polyphenol-gut microbiota interrelationship is complex and not yet fully elucidated. Finally, we highlighted various pending research questions that will help identify effective targets for intervention with precision nutrition, thus maximizing individual responses to dietary and lifestyle interventions and improving human health.",

      "abstract": "Bioflavonoids, are a diverse group of phytonutrients that are widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, grains, teas, and certain medicinal herbs. They are characterized by their antioxidant properties and play essential roles in plant biology, such as providing color to fruits and flowers, protecting plants from environmental stresses. Daidzein, a bioflavonoid classified under natural products, is sourced from plants like soybeans and legumes. It exists in forms such as glycosides and aglycones, with equol and trihydroxy isoflavone being key metabolites formed by gut bacteria. Known for its wide-ranging therapeutic potential, daidzein has shown effects on cardiovascular health, cancer, diabetes, skin conditions, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Its mechanisms include interaction with estrogen receptors, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and modulation of apoptosis and cell cycles. Recent advances in formulation technologies aimed at enhancing daidzein's bioavailability and efficacy are critically evaluated, including nanoparticle-based delivery systems and encapsulation strategies. Researchers have developed advanced formulations like nanoparticles and liposomes to enhance daidzein's solubility, stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery. Considered a promising nutraceutical, daidzein warrants further exploration into its molecular actions and safety profile to fully realize its clinical potential. This review offers a succinct overview encompassing therapeutic benefits, chemical characteristics, historical uses, toxicology insights, recent advancements in delivery systems, and future directions for daidzein research.",

Of the soy isoflavones, genistein and daidzein, in particular, have been studied, but recently, equol as a derivative has gained interest because it is more biologically potent. Different mechanisms of action have already been studied for the different isoflavones in multiple conditions, such as breast, gastrointestinal, and urogenital cancers. Many of these mechanisms of action could also be demonstrated in the prostate, both in vitro and in vivo. This review focuses on the known mechanisms of action at the cellular level and compares them between genistein, daidzein, and equol. These include androgen- and estrogen-mediated pathways, regulation of the cell cycle and cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In addition, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and epigenetics are addressed.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic hyperglycemia aggravates the prognosis of intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) in the clinic. In addition to hematoma expansion and increased inflammation, how diabetic hyperglycemia affects the outcomes of ICH is still unclear. We found that streptozotocin-induced diabetic hyperglycemia not only increased neutrophil infiltration, but also changed the gene expression profile of neutrophils, including lactoferrin (Ltf) encoding gene Ltf. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) transcribed Ltf and the lack of neutrophilic Ltf transcription and secretion exacerbated neuronal ferroptosis by accumulating intraneuronal iron. Furthermore, the administration of recombinant Ltf protected against neuronal ferroptosis and improved neurobehavior in hyperglycemic ICH mice, and vice versa. These results indicate that supplementing Ltf or inhibiting neuronal ferroptosis are promising potential strategies to improve the acute outcomes of diabetic ICH in the clinic.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (Lf) is a glycoprotein present in human and bovine milk with antimicrobial and immune-modulating properties. This review aimed to examine the evidence for the effect of Lf supplementation on inflammation, immune function, and respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in humans. Online databases were searched up to December 2020 to identify relevant, English-language articles that examined the effect of Lf supplementation in human subjects of all ages, on either inflammation, immune cell populations or activity, or the incidence, duration, or severity of respiratory illness or RTIs. Twenty-five studies (n = 20 studies in adults) were included, of which 8 of 13 studies (61%) in adults reported a decrease in at least 1 systemic inflammatory biomarker. Immune function improved in 6 of 8 studies (75%) in adults, with changes in immune cell populations in 2 of 6 studies (33%), and changes in immune cell activity in 2 of 5 studies (40%). RTI outcomes were reduced in 6 of 10 studies (60%) (n = 5 in adults, n = 5 in children), with decreased incidence in 3 of 9 studies (33%), and either decreased frequency (2/4, 50%) or duration (3/6, 50%) in 50% of studies. In adults, Lf reduced IL-6 [mean difference (MD): -24.9 pg/mL; 95% CI: -41.64, -8.08 pg/mL], but not C-reactive protein (CRP) [standardized mean difference: -0.09; 95% CI: -0.82, 0.65], or NK cell cytotoxicity [MD: 4.84%; 95% CI: -3.93, 13.60%]. RTI incidence was reduced in infants and children (OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.98) but not in adults (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.32). Clinical studies on Lf supplementation are limited, although findings show 200 mg Lf/d reduces systemic inflammation, while formulas containing 35-833 mg Lf/d may reduce RTI incidence in infants and children, suggesting improved immune function. Future research is required to determine optimal supplementation strategies and populations most likely to benefit from Lf supplementation.

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis (AS) is a common pathological basis for many cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and result in high mortality and immense health and economic burdens worldwide. Early prevention, diagnosis, and treatment are promising approaches for stemming the development and progression of AS. Lactoferrin (Lf) is an iron-binding glycoprotein belonging to the transferrin family. It is widely found in body fluids such as digestive tract fluids, tears, and milk. Lf possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, immunoregulatory, antioxidant and many other physiological functions. The serum Lf level is reportedly associated with the risk of AS and AS-related CVDs. Lf administration is closely involved in several mechanisms, including cholesterol metabolism, foam cell formation, ICAM-1 expression, homocysteine and leptin levels, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant function. Moreover, Lf has also been applied in the sythesis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents to detect AS. Lf plays an important role in AS and may therefore be used in its diagnosis and treatment. Thus, this article aims to review the association between Lf and the risk of AS and AS-related CVDs, the mechanisms of Lf administration on AS, and its potential application in AS diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Increased astrocytic lactoferrin (Lf) expression was observed in the brains of elderly individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Our previous study revealed that astrocytic Lf overexpression improved cognitive capacity by facilitating Lf secretion to neurons to inhibit β-amyloid protein (Aβ) production in APP/PS1 mice. Here, we further discovered that astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal loss by decreasing iron accumulation and increasing glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression in neurons within APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, human Lf (hLf) treatment inhibited ammonium ferric citrate (FAC)-induced ferroptosis by chelating intracellular iron. Additionally, machine learning analysis uncovered a correlation between Lf and GPX4. hLf treatment boosted low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) internalization and facilitated its interaction with heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70), thereby inhibiting HSC70 binds to GPX4, and eventually attenuating GPX4 degradation and FAC-induced ferroptosis. Overall, astrocytic Lf overexpression inhibited neuronal ferroptosis through two pathways: reducing intracellular iron accumulation and promoting GPX4 expression via inhibiting chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA)-mediated GPX4 degradation. Hence, upregulating astrocytic Lf expression is a promising strategy for combating AD.",

However, previous work of our group showed that IgA can also be involved in disease pathology, because it provides a potent stimulus to activate neutrophils after crosslinking of surface CD89 (FcaRI), resulting in chronic inflammation and tissue damage. IgA (auto)antibodies and neutrophils are key players in various diseases, including blistering skin diseases and rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, we generated an array of anti-CD89 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic targeting of CD89. The biological activity of newly developed anti-human CD89 mAbs and their potential therapeutic capacity were investigated.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein released from mucous secreting cells and neutrophils. LF can be used in a broad range of eye diseases related to the retina, cornea, and optic nerve. The retina is particularly affected by oxidative stress inside the photoreceptor being constantly exposed to light which induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) causing damage to photoreceptor recycling. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular degeneration are inherited retinopathies that consist of different disease-causing genes, that cause mutations with highly varied clinical consequences. Age-related macular degeneration is a chronic disease of the retina and one of the major causes of sight loss. This review provides an application of lactoferrin and LF-based nano-formulations or nanoparticles in the field of retinal diseases or corneal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, retinoblastoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), keratoconus and uveitis. Several studies have found that lactoferrin's antibacterial activity is not limited to its iron sequestration, but also its ability as a nanoparticle that acts as a carrier to deliver drugs by crossing the blood-retina barrier (BRB) and its involvement in cell cycle control, which is not possible by many transferrin proteins.",

Lactoferrin's antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity coupled with its bone-regenerating effects may make it suitable for improving bone and joint infection treatment. However, free lactoferrin (LF) has highly variable oral bioavailability in humans due to potential for degradation in the stomach and small intestine. It also has a short half-life in blood plasma. Therefore, encapsulating LF in nanocarriers may slow degradation in the gastrointestinal tract and enhance LF absorption, stability, permeability and oral bioavailability. This review will summarize the literature on the encapsulation of LF into liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, polymeric micro and nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite nanocrystals. The fabrication, characterization, advantages, disadvantages and applications of each system will be discussed and compared.",

      "abstract": "The oral cavity is a non-uniform, extraordinary environment characterized by mucosal, epithelial, abiotic surfaces and secretions as saliva. Aerobic and anaerobic commensal and pathogenic microorganisms colonize the tongue, teeth, jowl, gingiva, and periodontium. Commensals exert an important role in host defenses, while pathogenic microorganisms can nullify this protective function causing oral and systemic diseases. Every day, 750-1000 mL of saliva, containing several host defense constituents including lactoferrin (Lf), are secreted and swallowed. Lf is a multifunctional iron-chelating cationic glycoprotein of innate immunity. Depending on, or regardless of its iron-binding ability, Lf exerts bacteriostatic, bactericidal, antibiofilm, antioxidant, antiadhesive, anti-invasive, and anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we report the protective role of Lf in different oral pathologies, such as xerostomia, halitosis, alveolar or maxillary bone damage, gingivitis, periodontitis, and black stain. Unlike antibiotic therapy, which is ineffective against bacteria that are within a biofilm, adherent, or intracellular, the topical administration of Lf, through its simultaneous activity against microbial replication, biofilms, adhesion, and invasiveness, as well as inflammation, has been proven to be efficient in the treatment of all known oral pathologies without any adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is a protein found in several bodily fluids, such as milk. This protein has a diverse range of functions and is evolutionarily conserved. Lactoferrin is a multifunction protein with distinct biological abilities affecting mammals' immune structures. Reports indicated that the daily uptake of LF from dairy products is unsatisfactory in detecting further health-promoting abilities. Research has shown that it protects against infection, mitigates cellular senescence, and improves nutritional quality. Additionally, LF is being studied as a potential treatment for various diseases and conditions, including gastrointestinal issues and infections. Studies have also demonstrated its effectiveness against various viruses and bacteria. In this article, we'll look closer at the structure of LF and its various biological activities, including its antimicrobial, anti-viral, anti-cancer, anti-osteoporotic, detoxifying, and immunomodulatory properties. More specifically, the protective effect of LF against oxidative DNA damage was also clarified through its ability to abolish DNA damaging issues without interfacing with host genetic material. Fortification with LF protects mitochondria dysfunction syndromes via sustaining redox status and biogenesis and suppressing apoptosis and autophagy singling. Additionally, we'll examine the potential benefits of lactoferrin and provide an overview of recent clinical trials conducted to examine its use in laboratory and living models.",

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities remain unelucidated. In this paper, we review the structure, properties, and contents of different lactoferrin milk sources. The different biological activities, namely antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, bone regeneration, and improved metabolic disorder bioactivities, and the associated potential mechanisms of lactoferrin are summarized with the aim of providing a reference for the development of lactoferrin-related products.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin is a multifunctional glycoprotein naturally found in mammalian secretions, predominantly in colostrum and milk. As a key component of dairy foods, lactoferrin enhances viral protection and boosts human health, owing to its fundamental properties including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory effects. Importantly, the antiviral effect of lactoferrin has been shown against a range of viruses causing serious infections and threatening human health. One of the viruses that lactoferrin exerts significant antiviral effects on is the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is the most prevalent transmitted infection affecting a myriad of people around the world. Lactoferrin has a high potential to inhibit HPV via different mechanisms, including direct binding to viral envelope proteins or their cell receptors, thereby hindering viral entry and immune stimulation by triggering the release of some immune-related molecules through the body, such as lymphocytes. Along with HPV, lactoferrin also can inhibit a range of viruses including coronaviruses and hepatitis viruses in the same manner. Here, we overview the current knowledge of lactoferrin and its effects on HPV and other viral infections.",

      "abstract": "Adverse pregnancy outcomes affect 54 million people globally per year, with at least 50% of these attributed to infection during gestation. These include inflammation of the membranes surrounding the growing fetus (chorioamnionitis), preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), preterm birth (PTB), early-onset disease (EOD) and late-onset disease (LOD), neonatal and maternal sepsis, and maternal or fetal demise. Although universal screening and implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has improved EOD outcomes, these interventions have not reduced the incidences of LOD or complications occurring early on during pregnancy such as PPROM and PTB. Thus, novel therapies are needed to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes and to ameliorate disease risk in vulnerable populations. Lactoferrin has recently been explored as a potential therapeutic as it demonstrates strong antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity. Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein capable of iron chelation found in a variety of human tissues and is produced in high concentrations in human breast milk. In recent studies, lactoferrin has shown promise inhibiting growth and biofilm formation of streptococcal species, including Group B Streptococcus (GBS), a prominent perinatal pathogen. Understanding the interactions between lactoferrin and GBS could elucidate a novel treatment strategy for adverse pregnancy outcomes caused by GBS infection.",

      "abstract": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is composed of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and E3 ubiquitin ligase, which play a fundamental role in mediating intracellular protein degradation. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic regulated cell death caused by iron accumulation and subsequent lipid peroxidation. However, the key pathway for UPS to promote ferroptotic cell death is still poorly understood. Here, we screened 571 UPS-related E1, E2, and E3 genes in a human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) and identified the upregulation of NEDD4-like E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (NEDD4L) as a novel ferroptosis suppressor. Mass spectrometry analysis further showed that lactotransferrin (LTF), an iron-binding transport protein, is a direct NEDD4L-binding protein. Consequently, NEDD4L-mediated LTF protein degradation inhibits intracellular iron accumulation and subsequent oxidative damage-mediated ferroptotic cell death in various cancer cells. These findings establish a new molecular link between UPS and ferroptosis, which may lead to the development of potential anticancer strategies.",

Most CNS disorders are characterized by high oxidative stress levels and intense inflammatory responses in affected tissues. Lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional iron-binding glycoprotein, plays a significant role in anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulator, antitumor immunity, and anti-apoptotic processes. Previous studies have shown that Lf is abnormally expressed in a variety of neurological diseases, especially neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, the promotion of neurodevelopment and neuroprotection by Lf has attracted widespread attention, and Lf could be exploited both as an active therapeutic agent and drug nanocarrier. However, our understanding of the roles of Lf proteins in the initiation or progression of CNS diseases is limited, especially the roles of Lf in regulating neurogenesis. This review highlights recent advances in the understanding of the major pharmacological effects of Lf in CNS diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular disease, developmental delays in children, and brain tumors.",

Nevertheless, the instability of lactoferrin has limited its commercial application. Recent studies have focused on encapsulation to enhance the stability of lactoferrin. However, the molecular insights underlying the changes of structural properties of lactoferrin and the interaction with protectants remain poorly understood. Computational approaches have proven useful in understanding the structural properties of molecules and the key binding with other constituents. In this review, comprehensive information on the structure and function of lactoferrin and the binding with various molecules for food purposes are reviewed, with a special emphasis on the use of molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate the application of modeling and simulations to determine key residues of lactoferrin responsible for its stability and interactions with other biomolecular components under various conditions, which are also associated with its functional benefits. These have also been extended into the potential creation of enhanced lactoferrin for commercial purposes. This review provides valuable strategies in designing novel nutraceuticals for food science practitioners and those who have interests in acquiring familiarity with the application of computational modeling for food and health purposes.",

In disk diffusion assays performed with 112 isolates from 13 bacterial species (including the foodborne pathogens Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), a lactoferrin-based food supplement showed no inhibition of growth on 24%, moderate inhibition on 31%, and strong inhibition on 45% of all tested isolates. Minimal inhibitory concentrations against B. cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis strain-specifically ranged from 0.31 mg/mL to no impairment at all. Further 11 commercially available lactoferrin-based food supplements and purified bovine lactoferrin showed strain- as well as product-specific growth inhibition. In comparison to bovine lactoferrin, human lactoferrin showed no inhibitory effects. In summary, purified lactoferrin and lactoferrin-based food supplements inhibit bacterial growth in a dose-, strain-, and product-dependent manner. Thus, a general antimicrobial effect of lactoferrin against a specific bacterial species cannot be assumed.",

      "abstract": "Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) is an important virulence factor in Streptococcus pneumoniae that binds to lactoferrin and protects the bacterium from the bactericidal action of lactoferricins-cationic peptides released upon lactoferrin proteolysis. The present study investigated if PspA can prevent killing by another cationic peptide, indolicidin. PspA-negative pneumococci were more sensitive to indolicidin-induced killing than bacteria expressing PspA, suggesting that PspA prevents the bactericidal action of indolicidin. Similarly, chemical removal of choline-binding proteins increased sensitivity to indolicidin. The absence of capsule and PspA had an additive effect on pneumococcal killing by the AMP. Furthermore, anti-PspA antibodies enhanced the bactericidal effect of indolicidin on pneumococci, while addition of soluble PspA fragments competitively inhibited indolicidin action. Previous in silico analysis suggests a possible interaction between PspA and indolicidin. Thus, we hypothesize that PspA acts by sequestering indolicidin and preventing it from reaching the bacterial membrane. A specific interaction between PspA and indolicidin was demonstrated by mass spectrometry, confirming that PspA can actively bind to the AMP. These results reinforce the vaccine potential of PspA and suggest a possible mechanism of innate immune evasion employed by pneumococci, which involves binding to cationic peptides and hindering their ability to damage the bacterial membranes.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is present in the oviduct, reduces in vitro gamete interaction, and affects sperm capacitation parameters in humans. Our aim was to investigate LF actions on further stages of the reproductive process in the Wistar rat model. Motile sperm were obtained from cauda epididymis to assess LF binding by direct immunofluorescence and LF effect on acrosome reaction (AR) using a Coomassie blue staining. After ovarian hyperstimulation of female rats, oocytes were surgically recovered and coincubated with motile sperm and different doses of LF to estimate the in vitro fertilization (IVF) rate. To evaluate the LF effect on pregnancy and embryo implantation, female rats (80 days old) were placed with males and received daily intraperitoneal injections of LF during one complete estrous cycle (pregnancy experiments) or during the first 8 gestational days (implantation experiments). The number of pregnant females and live born pups was recorded after labor. Moreover, the number of implantation sites was registered during the implantation period. LF was able to bind to the sperm head, midpiece, and tail. 10 and 100 μg/ml LF stimulated the AR but reduced the IVF rate. The administration of 100 and 200 mg/kg LF significantly decreased the number of implantation sites and the litter size, whereas 100 mg/kg LF declined the pregnancy rate. The results suggest that LF might interfere with the reproductive process, possibly interfering with gamete interaction or inducing a premature AR; nevertheless, the mechanisms involved are yet to be elucidated.",

      "abstract": "There is a wide, and continuously widening, gap between the number of proteins known only by their amino acid sequence versus those structurally characterized by direct experiment. To close this gap, we mostly rely on homology-based inference and modeling to reason about the structures of the uncharacterized proteins by using structures of homologous proteins as templates. With the rapidly growing size of the Protein Data Bank, there are often multiple choices of templates, including multiple sets of coordinates from the same protein. The substantial conformational differences observed between different experimental structures of the same protein often reflect function related structural flexibility. Thus, depending on the questions being asked, using distant homologs, or coordinate sets with lower resolution but solved in the appropriate functional form, as templates may be more informative. The ModFlex server (https://modflex.org/) addresses this seldom mentioned gap in the standard homology modeling approach by providing the user with an interface with multiple options and tools to select the most relevant template and explore the range of structural diversity in the available templates. ModFlex is closely integrated with a range of other programs and servers developed in our group for the analysis and visualization of protein structural flexibility and divergence.",

While describing their wide variety of physiological, biochemical, and nutritional functionalities, we will emphasize their specific roles in the perinatal period. Afterwards, we will evaluate their ability to control oxidative stress, inflammation, gut mucosal barrier, and intestinal microbiota in link with cardiometabolic disorders (CMD) (obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension) and associated complications (diabetes and atherosclerosis). This review will not only attempt to highlight the mechanisms of action, but it will critically discuss the potential therapeutic applications of the underlined bioactive proteins in CMD.",

Global public health efforts to increase human lifespan have increasingly focused on lowering the risk of aging-related diseases, such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, and cancers. Dietary intervention is a promising approach to maintaining human health during aging. Lactoferrin (LF) is known for its physiologically pleiotropic properties. Anti-aging interventions of LF have proven to be safe and effective for various pharmacological activities, such as anti-oxidation, anti-cellular senescence, anti-inflammation, and anti-carcinogenic. Moreover, LF has a pivotal role in modulating the major signaling pathways that influence the longevity of organisms. Thus, LF is expected to be able to attenuate the process of aging and greatly ameliorate its effects.",

Pouchitis is a common complication with several different modalities that can be used to aid diagnosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at exploring the sensitivity and specificity these diagnostic modalities. The medical literature was searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE and EMBASE classic and PubMed from 1978 to June 2022. We calculated descriptive statistics using sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive rate of the primary studies and also their positive and negative likelihood ratios, and their diagnostic odds ratios. The screen found 5477 records with 13 studies being included. Faecal lactoferrin was found to have the highest pooled sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 88% respectively with imaging modalities coming in second and faecal calprotectin third with pooled sensitivities and specificities of 87% and 79% and 74% and 81% respectively. Faecal biomarkers particularly lactoferrin and imaging modalities may have an important role to play in diagnosing pouchitis. Importantly due to delays in availability of pouchoscopy, our data supports early ordering of these tests to help delineate from other causes. Further studies are required with larger cohort sizes to further validate these tests.",

      "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains one of the main causes of death for men worldwide. Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, patients develop resistance after an initial period of optimal efficacy. Nowadays, it is accepted that natural compounds can result in health benefits with a preventive or adjuvant effect. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of curcumin (CU), a bioactive compound in the spice turmeric, and lactoferrin (LF), a natural glycoprotein with immunomodulatory properties, on DU145 and PC3. Prostate cancer cells were cultured with and without LF (175 μM) and CU (2.5 μg/mL and 5 μg/mL), alone and in combination. Cell viability, migration ability, death receptors (DRs), and integrins (α3, β1) gene expression were evaluated, as well as human annexin V quantification and Akt phosphorylation. Differences among cells group, defined according to the treatment used, were assessed with ANOVA. The results showed that the effects of CU and LF are different between the two prostatic cell lines analyzed. In DU145, a reduction in cell proliferation and migration is reported both in the presence of single and combined treatments. In PC3 cells, there is a significant reduction in proliferation in the presence of CU alone, while the inhibition of migration is mainly related to the LF treatment and its combination with CU, compared to untreated cells. Moreover, the reduction in gene expression of integrins and Akt pathway activation were observed mostly in the presence of the CU and LF combination, including the upregulation of DR and annexin V levels, with greater significance for the DU145 cells.

      "title": "Therapeutic uses and applications of bovine lactoferrin in aquatic animal medicine: an overview.",
      "abstract": "Aquaculture is an important food sector throughout the globe because of its importance in ensuring the availability of nutritious and safe food for human beings. In recent years, this sector has been challenged with several obstacles especially the emergence of infectious disease outbreaks. Various treatment and control aspects, including antibiotics, antiseptics, and other anti-microbial agents, have been used to treat farmed fish and shrimp against diseases. Nonetheless, these medications have been prohibited and banned in many countries because of the development of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains, the accumulation of residues in the flesh of farmed fish and shrimp, and their environmental threats to aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, scientists and researchers have concentrated their research on finding natural and safe products to control disease outbreaks. From these natural products, bovine lactoferrin can be utilized as a functional feed supplement. Bovine lactoferrin is a multi-functional glycoprotein applied in various industries, like food preservation, and numerous medications, due to its non-toxic and ecological features. Recent research has proposed multiple advantages and benefits of using bovine lactoferrin in aquaculture. Reports showed its potential ability to enhance growth, reduce mortalities, regulate iron metabolism, decrease disease outbreaks, stimulate the antioxidant defense system, and recuperate the overall health conditions of the treated fish and shrimp. Besides, bovine lactoferrin can be considered as a safe antibiotic alternative and a unique therapeutic agent to decrease the negative impacts of infectious diseases. These features can be attributed to its well-known antibacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-inflammatory, immunostimulatory, and antioxidant capabilities. This literature review will highlight the implications of bovine lactoferrin in aquaculture, particularly highlighting its therapeutic features and ability to promote immunological defensive pathways in fish. The information included in this article would be valuable for further research studies to improve aquaculture's sustainability and the functionality of aquafeeds.",

      "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognise viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or CpG DNA via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 and TLR9, and produce interferon (IFN)-α. Activated pDCs upregulate human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and CD86 expression levels. Ingestion of bovine lactoferrin (LF) activates pDCs, but little is known about its effects. In this study, the effects of LF and its pepsin hydrolysate (LFH) on the production of IFN-α from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and pDCs were examined. PBMCs were prepared from peripheral blood of healthy adults and incubated with LF, LFH, or lactoferricin (LFcin) in the absence or presence of ssRNA derived from human immunodeficiency virus. The concentration of IFN-α in the supernatant and the expression levels of IFN-α, HLA-DR, and CD86 in pDCs were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. In the absence of ssRNA, the concentration of IFN-α was negligible and LF had no effect on it. In the presence of ssRNA, IFN-α was detected at a certain level, and LF and LFH significantly increased its concentration. The increase caused by LFH and LFcin were comparable. In addition, LF significantly upregulated the expression levels of IFN-α, HLA-DR, and CD86 in pDCs. LF and its digestive peptides induced IFN-α production and activated pDCs in the presence of ssRNA, suggesting that LF modulates the immune system by promoting pDC activation upon viral recognition.",

      "title": "Comparative Effects between Oral Lactoferrin and Ferrous Sulfate Supplementation on Iron-Deficiency Anemia: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Trials.",
      "abstract": "Ferrous sulfate is a commonly used iron supplement for the correction of iron-deficiency anemia but with frequent gastrointestinal side effects. Milk-derived iron-binding glycoprotein lactoferrin possesses well gastrointestinal tolerance and fewer side effects caused by the intake of high-dose iron. However, the underlying mechanism of the iron-enhancing effect of lactoferrin remains unclear. In addition, the comparative efficacies between lactoferrin and ferrous sulfate are also remained to be determined. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on published intervention studies to investigate how lactoferrin modulate iron metabolism and evaluate the comparative effects between lactoferrin and ferrous sulfate supplementation on iron absorption, iron storage, erythropoiesis and inflammation. Lactoferrin supplementation had better effects on serum iron (WMD: 41.44 ug/dL; p < 0.00001), ferritin (WMD: 13.60 ng/mL; p = 0.003) and hemoglobin concentration (11.80 g/dL; p < 0.00001), but a reducing effect on fractional iron absorption (WMD: −2.08%; p = 0.02) and IL-6 levels (WMD: −45.59 pg/mL; p < 0.00001) compared with ferrous sulfate. In conclusion, this study supports lactoferrin as a superior supplement to ferrous sulfate regarding the improvement in serum iron parameters and hemoglobin levels. Considering the weak influence of lactoferrin on iron absorption, the anti-inflammation effect of lactoferrin may be the potential mechanism to explain its efficacy on iron status and erythropoiesis.",

      "abstract": "Piglets, especially weaning piglets, show a lower level of immunity and higher morbidity and mortality, owing to their rapid growth, physiological immaturity, and gradual reduction of maternal antibodies, which seriously affects their growth and thus, value. It is important that piglets adapt to nutrient digestion and absorption and develop sound intestinal function and colonization with gut microbiota as soon as possible during their early life stage. Lactoferrin is a natural glycoprotein polypeptide that is part of the transferrin family. It is widely found in mucosal secretions such as saliva and tears, and most highly in milk and colostrum. As a multifunctional bioactive protein and a recommended food additive, lactoferrin is a potential alternative therapy to antibiotics and health promoting additive for piglet nutrition and development. It is expected that lactoferrin, as a natural food additive, could play an important role in maintaining pig health and development. This review examines the following known beneficial effects of lactoferrin: improves the digestion and capacity for absorption in the intestinal tract; promotes the absorption of iron and reduces the incidence of iron deficiency anemia; regulates intestinal function and helps to balance the microbial biota; and enhances the resistance to disease of the piglets via modulating and enhancing the immune system.",

      "abstract": "Lactoferrin (LF) is a naturally present iron-binding globulin with the structural properties of an N-lobe strongly positively charged terminus and a cage-like structure of nano self-assembly encapsulation. These unique structural properties give it potential for development in the fields of electrostatic spinning, targeted delivery systems, and the gut-brain axis. This review will provide an overview of LF's unique structure, encapsulation, and targeted transport capabilities, as well as its applications in immunity and gut microbiota regulation. First, the microstructure of LF is summarized and compared with its homologous ferritin, revealing both structural and functional similarities and differences between them. Second, the electrostatic interactions of LF and its application in electrostatic spinning are summarized. Its positive charge properties can be applied to functional environmental protection packaging materials and to improving drug stability and antiviral effects, while electrostatic spinning can promote bone regeneration and anti-inflammatory effects. Then the nano self-assembly behavior of LF is exploited as a cage-like protein to encapsulate bioactive substances to construct functional targeted delivery systems for applications such as contrast agents, antibacterial dressings, anti-cancer therapy, and gene delivery. In addition, some covalent and noncovalent interactions of LF in the Maillard reaction and protein interactions and other topics are briefly discussed. Finally, LF may affect immunological function via controlling the gut microbiota. In conclusion, this paper reviews the research advances of LF in electrostatic spinning, nano self-assembly, and immune and gut microbiota regulation, aiming to provide a reference for its application in the food and pharmaceutical fields.",

      "abstract": "Medium-chain triglycerides contain medium-chain fatty acid esterified to the glycerol backbone. These MCFA have a shorter chain length and are quickly metabolized in the body serving as an immediate energy source. They are known to have good physiological as well as functional characteristics which help in treating various health disorders. Naturally, they are found in coconut oil, milk fat, and palm kernel oil, and they are synthetically produced by esterification and interesterification reactions. Due to their numerous health benefits, MCT is used as a functional or nutraceutical oil in various food and pharmaceutical formulations. To increase their nutraceutical benefits and food applications MCFA can be used along with polyunsaturated fatty acids in the synthesis of structured lipids. This review aims to provide information about triglycerides of MCFA, structure, metabolism, properties, synthetic routes, intensified synthesis approaches, health benefits, application, and safety of use of MCT in the diet.",

      "abstract": "Recently, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has been reported to be strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is partly due to insulin resistance in the brain. Insulin signaling and the number of insulin receptors may decline in the brain of T2DM patients, resulting in impaired synaptic formation, neuronal plasticity, and mitochondrial metabolism. In AD patients, hypometabolism of glucose in the brain is observed before the onset of symptoms. Amyloid-β accumulation, a main pathology of AD, also relates to impaired insulin action and glucose metabolism, although ketone metabolism is not affected. Therefore, the shift from glucose metabolism to ketone metabolism may be a reasonable pathway for neuronal protection. To promote ketone metabolism, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and a ketogenic diet could be introduced as an alternative source of energy in the brain of AD patients.",

      "abstract": "Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are esters of fatty acids with 6 to 12 carbon atom chains. Naturally, they occur in various sources; their composition and bioactivity are source and extraction process-linked. The molecular size of MCT oil permits unique metabolic pathways and energy production rates, making MCT oil a high-value functional food. This review details the common sources of MCT oil, presenting critical information on the various approaches for MCT oil extraction or synthesis. Apart from conventional techniques, non-thermal processing methods that show promising prospects are analyzed. The biological effects of MCT oil are summarized, and the range of need-driven modification approaches are elaborated. A section is devoted to highlighting the recent trends in the application of MCT oil for food, nutraceuticals, and allied applications. While much is debated about the role of MCT oil in human health and wellness, there is limited information on daily requirements, impact on specific population groups, and effects of long-term consumption. Nonetheless, several studies have been conducted and continue to identify the most effective methods for MCT oil extraction, processing, handling, and storage. A knowledge gap exists and future research must focus on technology packages for scalability and sustainability.",

As a result, brain glucose utilization is compromised, causing a cellular energy deficit that leads to the accumulation of free radicals, which increases inflammation and damages neurons. When glucose utilization is impaired, ketone bodies offer an alternative energy source. Ketone bodies are synthesized from fats, obtained from either the diet or adipose tissue. Dietary medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), which are preferentially metabolized into ketone bodies, have the potential to supply the insulin-resistant brain with energy.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective Butter coffee drinks, mainly a form of a saturated fat diet, are widely accepted as a \"healthy energy-boosting drink\", especially in the young and healthy military population. The objective of our study was to determine the effects of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil and butter on lipid profile, especially apolipoprotein B (ApoB), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C), and other risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as BMI, BP, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in healthy adults. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective study of 60 subjects who were randomized to one of the two following regimens: (1) coffee or (2) coffee with butter plus MCT oil combination. The primary outcome was the effect on ApoB. Secondary outcomes were as follows: non-HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, BP, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and HbA1c. These parameters were evaluated at the baseline and after 12 weeks. The Mann-Whitney U test was utilized for analysis of the results. Results While 60 subjects were recruited for the study, only 41 completed it, meeting the minimum required sample size (17 per group) necessary to achieve the desired effect size: 21 males (nine in the control group and 12 in the experimental group) and 20 females (10 in each group). Anthropometric measures were similar between the two groups at baseline, and so were age and BMI (average age: 33.00 ± 5.84 years among controls and 30.86 ± 6.14 years in the experimental group; BMI: 27.35 ± 4.63 kg/m",

      "abstract": "Foam formulations are safe and effective therapy options for the treatment of chronic skin conditions that require the application of a topical formulation to delicate skin areas, such as scalp psoriasis or seborrheic dermatitis. This study focused on the development of foamable emulsions based on aqueous phospholipid blends. The effects of cosurfactants (nonionic Lauryglucoside (LG); zwitterionic Lauramidopropyl betaine (LAPB)), as well as of oil phases of different polarities, namely paraffin oil (PO), medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and castor oil (CO), were investigated. The foaming experiments showed that both the type of cosurfactant, as well as the type of oil phase, affects the quality of the resulting foam. Emulsions that were based on a combination of hydrogenated lysophosphatidylcholine (hLPC) and a non-hydrogenated phospholipid, as well as LG as a cosurfactant and MCT as an oil phase, yielded the most satisfactory results. Furthermore, profile analysis tensiometry (PAT), polarization microscopy and laser diffraction analysis were used to characterize the developed formulations. These experiments suggest that the employed phospholipids predominantly stabilize the emulsions, while the cosurfactants are mainly responsible for the formation and stabilization of the foams. However, it appears that both sets of excipients are needed in order to acquire stable emulsions with satisfactory foaming properties.",

      "abstract": "Structured lipid is a type of modified form of lipid that is \"fabricated\" with the purpose to improve the nutritional and functional properties of conventional fats and oils derived from animal and plant sources. Such healthier choice of lipid received escalating attention from the public for its capability to manage the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Of which, medium-chain triacylglycerol (MCT) and medium-and long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT) are the few examples of the \"new generation\" custom-made healthful lipids which are mainly composed of medium chain fatty acid (MCFA). MCT is made up exclusively of MCFA whereas MLCT contains a mixture of MCFA and long chain fatty acid (LCFA), respectively. Attributed by the unique metabolism of MCFA which is rapidly metabolized by the body, MCFA and MCT showed to acquire multiple physiological and functional properties in managing and reversing certain health disorders. Several chemically or enzymatically oils and fats modification processes catalyzed by a biological or chemical catalyst such as acidolysis, interesterification and esterification are adopted to synthesis MCT and MLCT. With their purported health benefits, MCT and MLCT are widely being used as nutraceutical in food and pharmaceutical sectors. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review on MCT and MLCT, with an emphasis on the basic understanding of its structures, properties, unique metabolism; the current status of the touted health benefits; latest routes of production; its up-to-date applications in the different food systems; relevant patents filed and its drawbacks.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) persist as the primary cause of death worldwide, accounting for roughly 17.9 million fatalities each year. The prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (key risk factors for CVD) continues to escalate at an alarming rate, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies to address this global health crisis. Nutritional ketosis, induced through ketogenic diets, modified fasting, intermittent fasting, and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil consumption, has garnered attention for its potential cardioprotective effects. Ketosis is a metabolic state in which the body, due to a significantly reduced intake of carbohydrates, shifts its primary energy source from glucose to ketone bodies, i.e., beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate, and acetone, which are produced in the liver from fatty acids. This review examines the mechanisms by which ketone bodies, particularly BHB, mitigate cardiovascular risk. We focus mainly on the anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties of BHB and summarize recent evidence to highlight the clinical relevance of ketosis in cardiometabolic health.",

It was hypothesized that cysteine released by the disintegration of Cys-CS microspheres at a critical pH would cause AgNPs to aggregate, leading to color change. Cys-CS microspheres were produced as water-in-oil (paraffin oil, MCT oil, soybean oil) emulsions according to the KOH addition method. An enzymatic TTI was made using glucose oxidase, glucose, and catalase. Only paraffin oil produced Cys-CS microspheres (average diameter, 335 ± 100 µm), whereas the others did not, probably due to saponification with KOH. FTIR analysis confirmed that cysteine was encapsulated in the microspheres. The microspheres disintegrated at pH 6.18 in a titration test. The TTI pH gradually decreased and showed a sudden color change at pH 6.10, which was similar to the critical pH of microsphere disintegration.",

The enzyme catalysts have shown similar performance and lipozyme TL IM has been chosen as the catalyst based on its lower cost. The effects of reaction time, oil to methyl octanoate ratio, and enzyme loading on the reaction performance have been investigated with response surface methodology (RSM) utilizing the Box-Behnken approach. The optimized reaction was scaled up to 20 g. The possibility to source the medium chain fatty acid esters from coconut oil fatty acid distillate using a simple procedure was demonstrated and the possibility to use these esters for the interesterification of coconut oil has been demonstrated as well.",

The emulsions were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), rheometer, stability analyzer, Malvern particle size meter and confocal microscope. Results showed that all emulsions exhibited a gel-like characteristic with a storage modulus higher than the loss modulus. The elastic modulus and complex viscosity of the emulsions increased with the increase of MCT proportions. During the heating from 4 °C to 80 °C, the complex viscosity of all emulsions decreased first and then remained unchanged at a continuous high temperature, indicating that the emulsions had good stability and internal structural integrity during the cooling and high-temperature processes. With the increase of MCT proportions, the freeze-thaw stability of the emulsions increased first and then decreased, and showed the optimum with 10% MCT. That could be referred for the production of a product with better freeze-thaw stability and rheological property in the food and cosmetic industries.",

      "abstract": "Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) possess neuroprotective properties. However, the long-term metabolic consequences of supplementing a regular diet with cognition-enhancing doses of MCT are largely unknown. We studied the effects of chronic (28 days) supplementation of regular diet with different doses of MCT oil (1, 3, or 6 g/kg/day) or water (control) on working memory (Y-maze), behavior in the Open Field, spatial learning (Morris water maze), and weight of internal organs in male Wistar 2.5-m.o. Rats. In a separate experiment, we evaluated acute (single gavage) and chronic (28 days) effects of MCT or lard supplementation (3 g/kg) on blood biochemical parameters. MCT-1 and MCT-3 doses improved working memory in YM. In MWM, MCT-6 treatment improved spatial memory. Chronic MCT-1 or MCT-3 treatment did not affect internal organ weight, while MCT-6 dose increased liver weight and the brown/white adipose tissue ratio. Acutely, MCT administration elevated blood β-hydroxybutyrate and malondialdehyde levels. Chronic MCT administration (3 g/kg) did not affect the blood levels of glucose, lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, total and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, and aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase activities. Therefore, daily supplementation of standard feed with MCT resulted in mild intermittent ketosis. It improved working memory at lower concentrations without significant adverse side effects. At higher concentrations, it improved long-term spatial memory but also resulted in organ weight changes and is likely unsafe. These results highlight the importance of monitoring the metabolic effects of MCT supplementation alongside cognitive assessment in future studies of MCT's neuroprotective properties.",

      "abstract": "MCTs are increasingly being used to promote ketogenesis by patients on ketogenic diet therapy, but also by people with other conditions and by the general public for the perceived potential benefits. However, consumption of carbohydrates with MCTs and untoward gastrointestinal side effects, especially at higher doses, could decrease the sustainability of the ketogenic response. This single-center study investigated the impact of consuming carbohydrate as glucose with MCT oil compared to MCT alone on the BHB response. The effects of MCT oil versus MCT oil plus glucose on blood glucose, insulin response, levels of C8, C10, BHB, and cognitive function were determined, and side effects were monitored. A significant plasma BHB increase with a peak at 60 min was observed in 19 healthy participants (24.4 ± 3.9 years) after consuming MCT oil alone, and a more delayed but slightly higher peak was observed after consuming MCT oil plus glucose. A significant increase in blood glucose and insulin levels occurred only after MCT oil plus glucose intake. The overall mean plasma levels of C8 and C10 were higher with the intake of MCT oil alone. MCT oil plus glucose consumption showed improved scores for the arithmetic and vocabulary subtests.",

      "title": "Impact of fatty acid composition on markers of exocrine pancreatic stimulation in dogs.",
      "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis in dogs is typically managed with a low-fat diet. Human research suggests that consumption of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) may lessen pancreatic enzyme release compared to consumption of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). Twelve healthy adult colony dogs were fed a meal of cod and rice with either 3% metabolizable energy (ME) fat (control), high MCT (25% ME MCT oil, 25% ME butter), high saturated LCFA (50% ME butter), or high unsaturated LCFA (50% ME canola oil) in a 4-period by 4-treatment crossover design. Serum concentrations of canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity, gastrin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and serum activities of amylase and DGGR lipase (1,2-o-dilauryl-rac-glycero-3-glutaric acid-(69-methylresorufin) ester lipase) were measured at times 0 (fasted), 30, 120 and 180 minutes post-prandially. Following a 3-or 4-day wash-out period, each dog was assigned a new diet and the process was repeated for all treatments. Data were analyzed as a repeated-measures mixed model ANOVA. Post-hoc pairwise comparisons were run using Tukey-Kramer adjusted p-values. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to evaluate residual normality. All statistical assumptions were sufficiently met. Statistical significance was defined as P<0.05. Of the markers tested, only serum triglyceride concentrations were affected by treatment, with consumption of high MCT resulting in lower triglycerides than both LCFA groups at times 120 and 180 minutes (P<0.0001). As expected, the high MCT group had higher triglycerides compared to the control group (P<0.0001). The type of dietary fat consumed had little acute impact on most markers of exocrine pancreatic stimulation in healthy dogs.",

      "abstract": "Oil-in-water emulsions contain the inner oil phase, the protein membrane at the interface and the aqueous phase. In this study, the spatial partition of resveratrol was investigated in sunflower oil, fish oil, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and peppermint oil emulsions stabilized by native whey protein isolate (WPI), heat-denatured WPI and sodium caseinate. Resveratrol was added in the aqueous phase of emulsions and its partition was analyzed in term of resveratrol solubility in bulk oil and in the aqueous phase of protein, protein concentration and interfacial protein. The final concentrations of resveratrol in the aqueous phase were basically greater than those in the oil phase of fish oil, sunflower oil and MCT oil emulsions, while the final concentrations of resveratrol in the oil phase were greater than those in the aqueous phase of peppermint oil emulsions. The difference in the interfacial partition of resveratrol and proteins increased as the polyphenol solubility in bulk oil increased. Resveratrol solubility in the oil phase drove its transfer from the aqueous phase into the oil phase in all emulsions, except that the interfacial protein also contributed to the transfer in fish oil emulsions. The oil-water interface provided the microenvironment for the enrichment of resveratrol by proteins.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this work was to study the ability of nineteen food-grade microorganisms as Pickering emulsion (PE) stabilizers. Medium-chain triacylglycerol (MCT) oil-in-water (50:50) PEs were fabricated by 10 wt% or 15 wt% of thermally-inactivated yeast, cocci, Bacillus spp. and lactobacilli cells. The characteristics of microorganisms related to \"Pickering stabilization\" including morphology, surface charge, interfacial tension, and \"contact angle\" were firstly studied. After that, the cells-stabilized PEs were characterized from both kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints, microstructure and rheological properties. The interfacial tension and \"contact angle\" values of various microorganisms ranged from 16.33 to 38.31 mN/m, and from 15° to 106°, respectively. The mean droplet size of PEs ranged from 11.51 to 57.69 µm. Generally, the physical stability of cell-stabilized PEs followed this order: lactobacilli > Bacillus spp. > cocci > yeast. These variations were attributed to the morphology and cell wall composition. Increasing the microorganism concentration significantly increased the physical stability of PEs from a maximum of 12 days at 10 wt% to 35 days at 15 wt% as a result of better interface coverage. Shear-thinning and dominant elastic behaviors were observed in PEs. Physical stability was affected by the free energy of detachment. Therefore, food-grade microorganisms are suggested for stabilizing PEs.",

      "abstract": "(Background) Esophagectomy (EPG) presents high morbidity and mortality. Omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3FA) are a pharmaconutrient with benefits for postoperative morbidity. Studies of ω-3FA administered parenterally after esophagectomy are scarce. This study proposes to investigate the effect of combining fish oil lipid emulsions (LE) administered parenterally with enteral nutrition support. (Methods) Randomization was 1:1:1 in three groups: Group A received a LE mixture of 0.4 g/kg/day of fish oil and 0.4 g/kg/day of LCT/MCT 50:50, Group B received 0.8 g/kg/day of fish oil LE, and Group C received 0.8 g/kg/day of LCT/MCT 50:50. Variables were measured at recruitment time and day +1, +3, and +5. Inflammatory variables studied were Interlukin-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumoral necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-10, IL-8 and CD25s. Safety, nutritional parameters and complications were analyzed. (Results) Administration of ω-3LE in the immediate postoperative period did not modulate the earlier inflammatory response. Statistically significant differences were found in IL-6 and CRP overall temporal evolution but were not found when studying the type of LE administered or in patients needing critical care. Administration of ω-3 resulted in safe and improved hypertriglyceridemia, depending on the dose. (Conclusions) ω-3FA has no impact on the early inflammatory postoperative response assessed for a short period but was safe. More studies for longer periods are needed.",

A section of cell wall degrading enzymes, lysozyme from chicken egg white and human, lysostaphin, mutanolysin from Streptomyces globisporus and proteinase k and the hydrophobic protein zein were used for enzymatic and physical surface modifications. Cell surface modifications were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), microbial adhesion to hexadecane (MATH) test and zeta potential measurements. The modified cell hydrophobicity in terms of MATH values were increased (around four times) by the enzymatic and physical modifications for LBD and LGG compared to the control. Emulsions stabilized by modified bacterial cells showed higher stability in comparison with unmodified samples, especially for the samples modified with chicken egg lysozyme. Confocal microscopy revealed that the modified bacterial cells were absorbed at the interface between oil and water and preventing the oil particles from coalescence. Thus, modified bacterial cells can be used to formulate food-grade stable Pickering emulsions. Such Pickering emulsions can potentially be clean label alternatives to replace the conventional emulsion preparations.",

      "abstract": "This study was conducted to determine the effects of two different types of fat (krill oil [KO] and coconut oil [CO]) on obesity, behavioral tests, and some inflammatory markers when consumed with a high-fat or control diet in rats with depression. The study was conducted mainly in two phases: the induction of depression (37 days) and the dietary intervention (60 days). After the induction of depression by chronic unpredictable mild stress, dietary intervention started. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups with 10 rats in each group: (1) standard diet (SD), (2) SD + 5% KO, (3) SD + 5% medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)* (*CO to contain 5% MCT), (4) high-fat diet (HFD), (5) HFD + 5% KO, and (6) HFD + 5% MCT*. The open field test (OFT), forced swimming test (FST), and sucrose preference test were performed at baseline, end of the depression induction, and dietary intervention to observe behavioral changes in rats. After the final behavioral test, animals were sacrificed, and blood samples were collected for biochemical analyses C-reactive protein (milligram per liter), cortisol (microgram per deciliter), and insulin (micro-international units per milliliter) to assess inflammatory changes in the blood. All data were analyzed under two headings: baseline, end of depression induction, end of dietary intervention, and dietary intervention groups. Body weight gain was highest in the SD+KO and lowest in the SD+MCT group (",

The nanoemulsion system was developed by encapsulating Cur with quaternized chitosan (QMNE), and the nanoemulsion containing Cur and medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (MNE) was used as control sample. The microstructure of the nanoemulsion was examined using Dynamic light scattering (DLS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The storage, thermal, ionic strength, and pH stability of QMNE were also evaluated, respectively. The results indicate that QMNE demonstrates superior stability, in vitro gastric fluid stability, bioavailability compared to MNE. QMNE exhibits excellent emulsification activity and stability. In addition, QMNE shows significant protection against oxidation in both emulsion systems after different heat treatments. The antimicrobial activity results reveal that QMNE exhibits greater efficacy than that of MNE. Consequently, this study provides valuable insights into the formulation of a system to encapsulate Cur and the improvement of its stability and bioavailability.",

      "abstract": "Inherited errors of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) are life threatening, even with optimum care. FAO is the major source of energy for heart and is critical for skeletal muscles especially during physiologic stress. Clinical trials revealed that triheptanoin (commercially known as Dojolvi; C7G), improved heart function and decreased hypoglycemia in long chain FAO disorders, but other symptoms including rhabdomyolysis persisted, suggesting suboptimal tissue distribution/utilization of heptanoic acid (C7) conjugates and/or rapid liver breakdown. In this study, medium branched chain fatty acids were tested as potential anaplerotic treatments in fibroblasts from patients deficient in very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), trifunctional protein (TFP), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II). Cells were cultured to near confluency and treated with C7, 2,6-dimethylheptanoic acid (dMC7), 6-amino-2,4-dimethylheptanoic acid (AdMC7), or 4,8-dimethylnonanoic acid (dMC9) for 72 h and targeted metabolomics performed. The profile of TCA cycle intermediates was improved in cells treated with these branched chain fatty acids compared with C7. Intracellular propionate was higher in AdMC7 treated cells compared with C7 in VLCAD, LCHAD, and TFP deficient cell lines. With AdMC7 treatment, succinate was higher in CPT II and VLCAD deficient cells, compared with C7. Malate and glutamate were consistently higher in AdMC7 treated VLCAD, LCHAD, TFP, and CPT II deficient cells compared with the C7 treatment. The results provide the impetus to further evaluate and consider branched chain fatty acids as viable anaplerotic therapy for fatty acid oxidation disorders and other diseases.",

      "abstract": "Mayonnaise is a semisolid oil-in-water emulsion comprised of egg yolk, oil, and vinegar. One main problem with mayonnaise is its high fat content, so efforts have been made to develop low-fat sauces with similar characteristics to real mayonnaise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) blended with edible oil (soybean and olive oil) on the rheological, physicochemical, and sensory properties of low-fat mayonnaise. The results revealed that the shear viscosity decreased with the increase in medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) contents and decreased with an increasing shear rate. Tan δ was <1, and a semisolid fluid with shear-thinning behavior was formed. The oscillation frequency test showed that the MCFA-containing mayonnaise was viscoelastic. The particle size and oil droplet analyses revealed that the emulsion droplet size and distribution were not significantly different in the MCT group compared to the control. The sensory evaluation demonstrated that the MCFA-containing mayonnaise was acceptable. This study illustrates that MCTs are a good substitute to produce the proper physicochemical properties of mayonnaise.",

      "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by progressive kidney failure, significantly increases mortality and comorbidity risks such as anemia. This study contrasts the impacts of omega-3 and medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) oil on levels of iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and transferrin saturation in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis. This interventional trial was conducted on 120 patients with CKD undergoing dialysis in Rasht, Iran. For 8 weeks, the omega-3 group was orally administered three 1000-mg capsules of omega-3 fatty acid supplement, and the MCT group was administered three 1000-mg capsules containing MCT oil daily. Serum concentrations of ferritin, iron, TIBC, Hb, and transferrin saturation were assessed pre-intervention and after the intervention. There was a significant increase in serum iron levels in the MCT group compared to the omega-3 group (103.72 ± 57.8 vs. 77.48±40.13; P = 0.031). No effect was found regarding other iron-related factors such as TIBC, Hb, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels. The results of our study indicated that taking MCT oil increased serum iron levels compared to omega-3 supplementation in patients with CKD undergoing dialysis. Further research is needed to better understand the potential benefits of MCT oils in patients with CKD.",

Bolus injections of IV emulsions, on the other hand, have emerged as a novel therapeutic approach to treat various acute disorders. However, intravascular metabolism and organ delivery of acute IV injection of emulsions containing both MCT and FO are not fully defined, nor have they been characterized across common experimental animal models.

      "abstract": "In animal studies, β-nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) supplementation increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) concentrations and improves healthspan and lifespan with great safety. However, it is unclear if these effects can be transferred to humans. This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-dependent clinical trial included 80 middle-aged healthy adults being randomized for a 60-day clinical trial with once daily oral dosing of placebo, 300 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg NMN. The primary objective was to evaluate blood NAD concentration with dose-dependent regimens. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of NMN supplementation, next to the evaluation of clinical efficacy by measuring physical performance (six-minute walking test), blood biological age (Aging.Ai 3.0 calculator), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and subjective general health assessment [36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36)]. Statistical analysis was performed using the Per Protocol analysis with significant level set at p = 0.05. All 80 participants completed the trial without trial protocol violation. Blood NAD concentrations were statistically significantly increased among all NMN-treated groups at day 30 and day 60 when compared to both placebo and baseline (all p ≤ 0.001). Blood NAD concentrations were highest in the groups taking 600 mg and 900 mg NMN. No safety issues, based on monitoring adverse events (AEs), laboratory and clinical measures, were found, and NMN supplementation was well tolerated. Walking distance increase during the six-minute walking test was statistically significantly higher in the 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg groups compared to placebo at both days 30 and 60 (all p < 0.01), with longest walking distances measured in the 600 mg and 900 mg groups. The blood biological age increased significantly in the placebo group and stayed unchanged in all NMN-treated groups at day 60, which resulted in a significant difference between the treated groups and placebo (all p < 0.05). The HOMA-IR showed no statistically significant differences for all NMN-treated groups as compared to placebo at day 60. The change of SF-36 scores at day 30 and day 60 indicated statistically significantly better health of all three treated groups when compared to the placebo group (p < 0.05), except for the SF-36 score change in the 300 mg group at day 30. NMN supplementation increases blood NAD concentrations and is safe and well tolerated with oral dosing up to 900 mg NMN daily. Clinical efficacy expressed by blood NAD concentration and physical performance reaches highest at a dose of 600 mg daily oral intake. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04823260, and Clinical Trial Registry - India, CTRI/2021/03/032421.",

      "title": "Dietary Supplementation With NAD+-Boosting Compounds in Humans: Current Knowledge and Future Directions.",
      "abstract": "Advancing age and many disease states are associated with declines in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. Preclinical studies suggest that boosting NAD+ abundance with precursor compounds, such as nicotinamide riboside or nicotinamide mononucleotide, has profound effects on physiological function in models of aging and disease. Translation of these compounds for oral supplementation in humans has been increasingly studied within the last 10 years; however, the clinical evidence that raising NAD+ concentrations can improve physiological function is unclear. The goal of this review was to synthesize the published literature on the effects of chronic oral supplementation with NAD+ precursors on healthy aging and age-related chronic diseases. We identified nicotinamide riboside, nicotinamide riboside co-administered with pterostilbene, and nicotinamide mononucleotide as the most common candidates in investigations of NAD+-boosting compounds for improving physiological function in humans. Studies have been performed in generally healthy midlife and older adults, adults with cardiometabolic disease risk factors such as overweight and obesity, and numerous patient populations. Supplementation with these compounds is safe, tolerable, and can increase the abundance of NAD+ and related metabolites in multiple tissues. Dosing regimens and study durations vary greatly across interventions, and small sample sizes limit data interpretation of physiological outcomes. Limitations are identified and future research directions are suggested to further our understanding of the potential efficacy of NAD+-boosting compounds for improving physiological function and extending human health span.",

In 2016, the first clinical trial of nicotinamide riboside was conducted to test the safety and efficacy of human supplementation. Many trials have since been conducted aiming to delineate benefits to metabolic health and severe diseases in humans. This review endeavors to summarize and critically assess the 25 currently published research articles on human nicotinamide riboside supplementation to identify any poorly founded claims and assist the field in elucidating the actual future potential for nicotinamide riboside. Collectively, oral nicotinamide riboside supplementation has displayed few clinically relevant effects, and there is an unfortunate tendency in the literature to exaggerate the importance and robustness of reported effects. Even so, nicotinamide riboside may play a role in the reduction of inflammatory states and has shown some potential in the treatment of diverse severe diseases.",

      "title": "Nutraceutical activation of Sirt1: a review.",
      "abstract": "The deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), activated by calorie restriction and fasting, exerts several complementary effects on cellular function that are favourable to healthspan; it is often thought of as an 'anti-aging' enzyme. Practical measures which might boost Sirt1 activity are therefore of considerable interest. A number of nutraceuticals have potential in this regard. Nutraceuticals reported to enhance Sirt1 synthesis or protein expression include ferulic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, urolithin A, melatonin, astaxanthin, carnosic acid and neochlorogenic acid. The half-life of Sirt1 protein can be enhanced with the natural nicotinamide catabolite N1-methylnicotinamide. The availability of Sirt1's obligate substrate NAD+ can be increased in several ways: nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can function as substrates for NAD+ synthesis; activators of AMP-activated kinase-such as berberine-can increase expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which is rate limiting for NAD+ synthesis; and nutraceutical quinones such as thymoquinone and pyrroloquinoline quinone can boost NAD+ by promoting oxidation of NADH. Induced ketosis-as via ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides-can increase NAD+ in the brain by lessening the reduction of NAD+ mediated by glycolysis. Post-translational modifications of Sirt1 by O-GlcNAcylation or sulfonation can increase its activity, suggesting that administration of glucosamine or of agents promoting hydrogen sulfide synthesis may aid Sirt1 activity. Although resveratrol has poor pharmacokinetics, it can bind to Sirt1 and activate it allosterically-as can so-called sirtuin-activating compound drugs. Since oxidative stress can reduce Sirt1 activity in multiple ways, effective antioxidant supplementation that blunts such stress may also help preserve Sirt1 activity in some circumstances. Combination nutraceutical regimens providing physiologically meaningful doses of several of these agents, capable of activating Sirt1 in complementary ways, may have considerable potential for health promotion. Such measures may also amplify the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in non-diabetic disorders, as these benefits appear to reflect upregulation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase activities.",

      "abstract": "High mortality rates due to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have attracted worldwide attention. It has been reported that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most important mechanisms affecting the pathogenesis of CVDs. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations may result in impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), abnormal respiratory chains, and ATP production. In dysfunctional mitochondria, the electron transport chain (ETC) is uncoupled and the energy supply is reduced, while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is increased. Here, we discussed and analyzed the relationship between mtDNA mutations, impaired mitophagy, decreased OXPHOS, elevated ROS, and CVDs from the perspective of mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, we explored current potential therapeutic strategies for CVDs by eliminating mtDNA mutations (e.g., mtDNA editing and mitochondrial replacement), enhancing mitophagy, improving OXPHOS capacity (e.g., supplement with NAD",

      "abstract": "Disrupted biological function, manifesting through the hallmarks of aging, poses one of the largest threats to healthspan and risk of disease development, such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular ailments, and neurodegeneration. In recent years, numerous geroprotectors, senolytics, and other nutraceuticals have emerged as potential disruptors of aging and may be viable interventions in the immediate state of human longevity science. In this review, we focus on the decrease in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with age and the supplementation of NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinamide riboside (NR), in combination with other geroprotective compounds, to restore NAD+ levels present in youth. Furthermore, these geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NMN supplementation while concurrently providing their own numerous health benefits. By analyzing the prevention of NAD+ degradation through the inhibition of CD38 or supporting protective downstream agents of SIRT1, we provide a potential framework of the CD38/NAD+/SIRT1 axis through which geroprotectors may enhance the efficacy of NAD+ precursor supplementation and reduce the risk of age-related diseases, thereby potentiating healthspan in humans.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin D is a key component for optimal growth and for calcium-phosphate homeostasis. Skin photosynthesis is the main source of vitamin D. Limited sun exposure and insufficient dietary vitamin D supply justify vitamin D supplementation in certain age groups. In older adults, recommended doses for vitamin D supplementation vary between 200 and 2000 IU/day, to achieve a goal of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) of at least 50 nmol/L. The target level depends on the population being supplemented, the assessed system, and the outcome. Several recent large randomized trials with oral vitamin D regimens varying between 2000 and 100,000 IU/month and mostly conducted in vitamin D-replete and healthy individuals have failed to detect any efficacy of these approaches for the prevention of fracture and falls. Considering the well-recognized major musculoskeletal disorders associated with severe vitamin D deficiency and taking into account a possible biphasic effects of vitamin D on fracture and fall risks, an European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) working group convened, carefully reviewed, and analyzed the meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the effects of vitamin D on fracture risk, falls or osteoarthritis, and came to the conclusion that 1000 IU daily should be recommended in patients at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency. The group also addressed the identification of patients possibly benefitting from a vitamin D loading dose to achieve early 25-hydroxyvitamin D therapeutic level or from calcifediol administration.",

      "abstract": "Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common sensory disability associated with human aging. Yet, there are no approved measures for preventing or treating this debilitating condition. With its slow progression, continuous and safe approaches are critical for ARHL treatment. Nicotinamide Riboside (NR), a NAD+ precursor, is well tolerated even for long-term use and is already shown effective in various disease models including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. It has also been beneficial against noise-induced hearing loss and in hearing loss associated with premature aging. However, its beneficial impact on ARHL is not known. Using two different wild-type mouse strains, we show that long-term NR administration prevents the progression of ARHL. Through transcriptomic and biochemical analysis, we find that NR administration restores age-associated reduction in cochlear NAD+ levels, upregulates biological pathways associated with synaptic transmission and PPAR signaling, and reduces the number of orphan ribbon synapses between afferent auditory neurons and inner hair cells. We also find that NR targets a novel pathway of lipid droplets in the cochlea by inducing the expression of CIDEC and PLIN1 proteins that are downstream of PPAR signaling and are key for lipid droplet growth. Taken together, our results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of NR treatment for ARHL and provide novel insights into its mechanism of action.",

Ferroptosis is a form of regulated necrosis driven by iron-dependent peroxidation of phospholipids and contributes to kinds of tissue injuries. However, it remains unclear whether the accumulation of lipid peroxides in UV irradiation-induced skin injury could lead to ferroptosis. We generated UV irradiation-induced skin injury mice model to examine the accumulation of the lipid peroxides and iron. Lipid peroxides 4-HNE, the oxidative enzyme COX2, the oxidative DNA damage biomarker 8-OHdG, and the iron level were increased in UV irradiation-induced skin. The accumulation of iron and lipid peroxidation was also observed in UVB-irradiated epidermal keratinocytes without actual ongoing ferroptotic cell death. Ferroptosis was triggered in UV-irradiated keratinocytes stimulated with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to mimic the iron overload. Although GPX4 protected UVB-injured keratinocytes against ferroptotic cell death resulted from dysregulation of iron metabolism and the subsequent increase of lipid ROS, keratinocytes enduring constant UVB treatment were markedly sensitized to ferroptosis.

      "title": "NAD+ supplement relieved chronic sleep restriction (CSR)-induced microglial proinflammation in vivo and in vitro.",
      "abstract": "Sleep insufficiency is a significant health problem worldwide and can induce multiple neurodevelopmental disorders in the central nervous system (CNS). Sleep deprivation (SD), especially chronic SD, leads to cognition and memory loss and worsens neurodegenerative disease liability. Microglia are the main inflammation-dominant glia and play a crucial role in SD-induced neurological impairments. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a redox reaction coenzyme that exerts anti-inflammatory and mitochondria-protective effects in microglia. Whether NAD+ mitigated SD-induced neurological disorders by regulating microglial functions is still unknown. In the current study, we designed an in vivo and in vitro model to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of NAD+ on chronic sleep restriction (CSR) and further investigate the underlying mechanisms. Behavioral tests and immunofluorescence staining were applied to investigate the cognition impairments and microglial activation. Biochemical experiments were tested to analyze the oxidative status and possible mechanism. In vitro data were used to verify the in vivo data. Our results displayed that NAD+ supplement mitigated CSR-induced cognitive decline and microglial activation response by suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo. NAD+ administration also decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial impairments in microglia. In vitro results showed that NAD+ treatment inhibited ROS production and prompted M1 conversion to M2 phenotype. cGAS-STING/NF-κB pathways were significantly activated but down-regulated by NAD+ administration. H151, a STING antagonist, was applied to validate that NAD+ treatment alleviates neuroinflammation partially by regulating cGAS-STING pathways in microglia. Our findings suggest that NAD+ supplement is a promising therapy for sleep disorders-induced neurological problems, and cGAS-STING pathway may act as a critical regulator in microglial proinflammation.",

Unfortunately, no accurate diagnostic or laboratory tests have been established, nor are any universally effective approved drugs currently available for its treatment. This study aimed to examine whether oral coenzyme Q10 and NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) co-supplementation could improve perceived fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and health-related quality of life in ME/CFS patients.

      "abstract": "The study evaluated how ingestion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) for 12 weeks by older adults affected blood nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) levels and physical function, particularly walking function. Information concerning sleep, and stress was also collected as secondary endpoints. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group comparison study, 60 participants were randomly allocated into a placebo group or NMN group. Members of the NMN group consumed 250 mg/day NMN for 12 weeks. Motor function tests, blood NAD metabolite analysis, and questionnaires were conducted at the start of the study and 4 and 12 weeks after intake. This trial was registered at umin.ac.jp/ctr as UMIN000047871 on June 22nd, 2022.At primary outcome, at both 4 weeks and 12 weeks, the NMN and placebo groups had no significant differences in a stepping test. At secondary outcomes, after 12 weeks of NMN intake, the NMN group had a significantly shorter 4-m walking time than the placebo group as well as significantly higher blood levels of NAD + and its metabolites. A significant negative correlation was observed between the change in the 4-m walking time and the change in blood NAD + , N",

      "title": "NMN: The NAD precursor at the intersection between axon degeneration and anti-ageing therapies.",
      "abstract": "The past 20 years of research on axon degeneration has revealed fine details on how NAD biology controls axonal survival. Extensive data demonstrate that the NAD precursor NMN binds to and activates the pro-degenerative enzyme SARM1, so a failure to convert sufficient NMN into NAD leads to toxic NMN accumulation and axon degeneration. This involvement of NMN brings the axon degeneration field to an unexpected overlap with research into ageing and extending healthy lifespan. A decline in NAD levels throughout life, at least in some tissues, is believed to contribute to age-related functional decay and boosting NAD production with supplementation of NMN or other NAD precursors has gained attention as a potential anti-ageing therapy. Recent years have witnessed an influx of NMN-based products and related molecules on the market, sold as food supplements, with many people taking these supplements daily. While several clinical trials are ongoing to check the safety profiles and efficacy of NAD precursors, sufficient data to back their therapeutic use are still lacking. Here, we discuss NMN supplementation, SARM1 and anti-ageing strategies, with an important question in mind: considering that NMN accumulation can lead to axon degeneration, how is this compatible with its beneficial effect in ageing and are there circumstances in which NMN supplementation could become harmful?",

      "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a type of programmed cell death resulting from iron overload-dependent lipid peroxidation, and could be promoted by activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3). SIRT1 is an enzyme accounting for removing acetylated lysine residues from target proteins by consuming NAD+, but its role remains elusive in ferroptosis and activating ATF3. In this study, we found SIRT1 was activated during the process of RSL3-induced glioma cell ferroptosis. Moreover, the glioma cell death was aggravated by SIRT1 activator SRT2183, but suppressed by SIRT inhibitor EX527 or when SIRT1 was silenced with siRNA. These indicated SIRT1 sensitized glioma cells to ferroptosis. Furthermore, we found SIRT1 promoted RSL3-induced expressional upregulation and nuclear translocation of ATF3. Silence of ATF3 with siRNA attenuated RSL3-induced increases of ferrous iron and lipid peroxidation, downregulation of SLC7A11 and GPX4 and depletion of cysteine and GSH. Thus, SIRT1 promoted glioma cell ferroptosis by inducting ATF3 activation. Mechanistically, ATF3 activation was reinforced when RSL3-induced decline of NAD+ was aggravated by FK866 that could inhibit NAD + synthesis via salvage pathway, but suppressed when intracellular NAD+ was maintained at higher level by supplement of exogenous NAD+. Notably, the NAD + decline caused by RSL3 was enhanced when SIRT1 was further activated by SRT2183, but attenuated when SIRT1 activation was inhibited by EX527. These indicated SIRT1 promoted ATF3 activation via consumption of NAD+. Finally, we found RSL3 activated SIRT1 by inducing reactive oxygen species-dependent upregulation of AROS. Together, our study revealed SIRT1 activated by AROS sensitizes glioma cells to ferroptosis via activation of ATF3-dependent inhibition of SLC7A11 and GPX4.",

      "abstract": "Glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are progressive retinal diseases characterized by increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review investigates the potential therapeutic benefits of NAD+ and niacin supplementation in managing glaucoma and AMD. A literature search was conducted encompassing keywords such as \"niacin\", \"NAD\", \"glaucoma\", \"AMD\", and \"therapeutics\". NAD+ depletion is associated with increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma and AMD. Niacin, a precursor to NAD+, has shown promise in replenishing NAD+ levels, improving choroidal blood flow, and reducing oxidative damage. Animal studies in glaucoma models indicate that nicotinamide (NAM) supplementation preserves RGC density and function. Large-scale population-based studies indicate an inverse correlation between niacin intake and glaucoma prevalence, suggesting a preventative role. Randomized controlled trials assessing niacin supplementation showed significant improvements in visual field sensitivity and inner retinal function, with a dose-dependent relationship. In AMD, nicotinamide supplementation may improve rod cell function and protect against oxidative stress-induced damage. Cross-sectional studies reveal that individuals with AMD have a lower dietary intake of niacin. Further studies suggest niacin's role in improving choroidal blood flow and dilating retinal arterioles, potentially mitigating ischemic damage and oxidative stress in AMD. Beyond current management strategies, NAD+ and niacin supplementation may offer novel therapeutic avenues for glaucoma and AMD. Further research is warranted to elucidate their efficacy and safety in clinical settings.",

Increasing public awareness and interest in anti-ageing strategies and health-promoting lifestyles have grown the interest in the use of NAD+ boosters as dietary supplements, both in scientific circles and among the general population. Here, we discuss the current trends in NAD+ precursor usage as well as the uncertainties in dosage, timing, safety, and side effects. There are many unknowns regarding pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, particularly bioavailability, metabolism, and tissue specificity of NAD+ boosters. Given the lack of long-term safety studies, there is a need for more clinical trials to determine the proper dose of NAD+ boosters and treatment duration for aging prevention and as disease therapy. Further research will also need to address the long-term consequences of increased NAD+ and the best approaches and combinations to increase NAD+ levels. The answers to the above questions will contribute to the more efficient and safer use of NAD+ boosters.",

      "abstract": "The role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) in ageing has emerged as a critical factor in understanding links to a wide range of chronic diseases. Depletion of NAD+, a central redox cofactor and substrate of numerous metabolic enzymes, has been detected in many major age-related diseases. However, the mechanisms behind age-associated NAD+ decline remains poorly understood. Despite limited conclusive evidence, supplements aimed at increasing NAD+ levels are becoming increasingly popular. This review provides renewed insights regarding the clinical utility and benefits of NAD+ precursors, namely nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), in attenuating NAD+ decline and phenotypic characterization of age-related disorders, including metabolic, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. While it is anticipated that NAD+ precursors can play beneficial protective roles in several conditions, they vary in their ability to promote NAD+ anabolism with differing adverse effects.

      "abstract": "The polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are abundant polycations of vital importance in mammalian cells. Their cellular levels are tightly regulated by degradation and synthesis, as well as by uptake and export. Here, we discuss the delicate balance between the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of polyamines in the context of Parkinson's disease (PD). Polyamine levels decline with aging and are altered in patients with PD, whereas recent mechanistic studies on ATP13A2 (PARK9) demonstrated a driving role of a disturbed polyamine homeostasis in PD. Polyamines affect pathways in PD pathogenesis, such as α-synuclein aggregation, and influence PD-related processes like autophagy, heavy metal toxicity, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal/mitochondrial dysfunction. We formulate outstanding research questions regarding the role of polyamines in PD, their potential as PD biomarkers, and possible therapeutic strategies for PD targeting polyamine homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Aging involves the systemic deterioration of all known cell types in most eukaryotes. Several recently discovered compounds that extend the healthspan and lifespan of model organisms decelerate pathways that govern the aging process. Among these geroprotectors, spermidine, a natural polyamine ubiquitously found in organisms from all kingdoms, prolongs the lifespan of fungi, nematodes, insects and rodents. In mice, it also postpones the manifestation of various age-associated disorders such as cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. The specific features of spermidine, including its presence in common food items, make it an interesting candidate for translational aging research. Here, we review novel insights into the geroprotective mode of action of spermidine at the molecular level, as we discuss strategies for elucidating its clinical potential.",

      "abstract": "The natural mammalian polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are essential for both normal and neoplastic cell function and replication. Dysregulation of metabolism of polyamines and their requirements is common in many cancers. Both clinical and experimental depletion of polyamines have demonstrated their metabolism to be a rational target for therapy; however, the mechanisms through which polyamines can establish a tumour-permissive microenvironment are only now emerging. Recent data indicate that polyamines can play a major role in regulating the antitumour immune response, thus likely contributing to the existence of immunologically 'cold' tumours that do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade. Additionally, the interplay between the microbiota and associated tissues creates a tumour microenvironment in which polyamine metabolism, content and function can all be dramatically altered on the basis of microbiota composition, dietary polyamine availability and tissue response to its surrounding microenvironment. The goal of this Perspective is to introduce the reader to the many ways in which polyamines, polyamine metabolism, the microbiota and the diet interconnect to establish a tumour microenvironment that facilitates the initiation and progression of cancer. It also details ways in which polyamine metabolism and function can be successfully targeted for therapeutic benefit, including specifically enhancing the antitumour immune response.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) is a universal double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensor that recognizes foreign and self-DNA in the cytoplasm and initiates innate immune responses and has been implicated in various infectious and non-infectious contexts. cGAS binds to the backbone of dsDNA and generates the second messenger, cGAMP, which activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Here, we show that the endogenous polyamines spermine and spermidine attenuated cGAS activity and innate immune responses. Mechanistically, spermine and spermidine induced the transition of B-form DNA to Z-form DNA (Z-DNA), thereby decreasing its binding affinity with cGAS. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism that decreases the cellular concentrations of spermine and spermidine, enhanced cGAS activation by inhibiting cellular Z-DNA accumulation; SAT1 deficiency promoted herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) replication in vivo. The results indicate that spermine and spermidine induce dsDNA to adopt the Z-form conformation and that SAT1-mediated polyamine metabolism orchestrates cGAS activity.",

      "abstract": "Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting prolong the lifespan and healthspan of model organisms and improve human health. The natural polyamine spermidine has been similarly linked to autophagy enhancement, geroprotection and reduced incidence of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases across species borders. Here, we asked whether the cellular and physiological consequences of caloric restriction and fasting depend on polyamine metabolism. We report that spermidine levels increased upon distinct regimens of fasting or caloric restriction in yeast, flies, mice and human volunteers. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of endogenous spermidine synthesis reduced fasting-induced autophagy in yeast, nematodes and human cells. Furthermore, perturbing the polyamine pathway in vivo abrogated the lifespan- and healthspan-extending effects, as well as the cardioprotective and anti-arthritic consequences of fasting. Mechanistically, spermidine mediated these effects via autophagy induction and hypusination of the translation regulator eIF5A. In summary, the polyamine-hypusination axis emerges as a phylogenetically conserved metabolic control hub for fasting-mediated autophagy enhancement and longevity.",

      "abstract": "Advanced age is a primary risk factor for female infertility due to reduced ovarian reserve and declining oocyte quality. However, as an important contributing factor, the role of metabolic regulation during reproductive aging is poorly understood. Here, we applied untargeted metabolomics to identify spermidine as a critical metabolite in ovaries to protect oocytes against aging. In particular, we found that the spermidine level was reduced in ovaries of aged mice and that supplementation with spermidine promoted follicle development, oocyte maturation, early embryonic development and female fertility of aged mice. By microtranscriptomic analysis, we further discovered that spermidine-induced recovery of oocyte quality was mediated by enhancement of mitophagy activity and mitochondrial function in aged mice, and this mechanism of action was conserved in porcine oocytes under oxidative stress. Altogether, our findings suggest that spermidine supplementation could represent a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate oocyte quality and reproductive outcome in cis-gender women and other persons trying to conceive at an advanced age. Future work is needed to test whether this approach can be safely and effectively translated to humans.",

In this article, recent findings on the safety, health effects, absorption and metabolism of spermidine were reviewed, and advances in food processing, including the raw materials evaluation, physical and chemical processing, and biological processing of spermidine, were highlighted. In particular, the core metabolic pathways, key gene targets, and efficient metabolic engineering strategies involved in the biosynthesis of spermidine and its precursors were discussed. Moreover, limitations and future perspectives of spermidine research were proposed. The purpose of this review is to provide new insights on spermidine from its safety to its food processing, which will advance the commercial production and applications of spermidine-rich foods and nutraceuticals.",

Apart from nutrition, spermidine is available to mammalian organisms from intracellular biosynthesis and microbial production in the gut. Importantly, externally supplied spermidine (via drinking water or food) prolongs lifespan, activates autophagy, improves mitochondrial function, and refills polyamine pools that decline during aging in various tissues of model organisms, including mice.

      "abstract": "The human gut microbiota plays numerous roles in regulating host growth, the immune system, and metabolism. Age-related changes in the gut environment lead to chronic inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and illness, which in turn affect aging and increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Local immunity is also affected by changes in the gut environment. Polyamines are crucial for cell development, proliferation, and tissue regeneration. They regulate enzyme activity, bind to and stabilize DNA and RNA, have antioxidative properties, and are necessary for the control of translation. All living organisms contain the natural polyamine spermidine, which has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It can regulate protein expression, prolong life, and improve mitochondrial metabolic activity and respiration. Spermidine levels experience an age-related decrease, and the development of age-related diseases is correlated with decreased endogenous spermidine concentrations. As more than just a consequence, this review explores the connection between polyamine metabolism and aging and identifies advantageous bacteria for anti-aging and metabolites they produce. Further research is being conducted on probiotics and prebiotics that support the uptake and ingestion of spermidine from food extracts or stimulate the production of polyamines by gut microbiota. This provides a successful strategy to increase spermidine levels.",

      "abstract": "Polyamines - putrescine, spermidine, and spermine - are widely distributed aliphatic compounds known to regulate important biological processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Therefore, spermidine insufficiency is associated with various physio-pathological processes, such as aging and cancers. Recent advances in immuno-metabolism and immunotherapy shed new light on the role of spermidine in immune cell regulation and anticancer responses. Here, we review novel works demonstrating that spermidine is produced by collective metabolic pathways of gut bacteria, bacteria-host co-metabolism, and by the host cells, including activated immune cells. We highlight the effectiveness of spermidine in enhancing antitumor responses in aged animals otherwise nonresponsive to immune checkpoint therapy and propose that spermidine supplementation could be used to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment.",

      "abstract": "Spermidine is an endogenous biological polyamine that plays various longevity-extending roles and exerts antioxidative, antiaging, and cell growth-promoting effects. We previously reported that spermidine levels were significantly reduced in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) of the lung. The present study assessed the potential beneficial effects of spermidine on lung fibrosis and investigated the possible mechanism. Lung fibrosis was established in mice using bleomycin (BLM), and exogenous spermidine was administered daily by intraperitoneal injection (50 mg/kg in phosphate-buffered saline). BLM-induced alveolar epithelial cells showed significant increases in apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related mediators, and spermidine attenuated BLM-induced apoptosis and activation of the ERS-related pathway. Senescence-associated β-gal staining and decreased expression of p16 and p21 showed that spermidine ameliorated BLM-induced premature cellular senescence. In addition, spermidine enhanced beclin-1-dependent autophagy and autophagy modulators in IPF fibroblasts and BLM-induced mouse lungs, in which inflammation and collagen deposition were significantly decreased. This beneficial effect was related to the antiapoptotic downregulation of the ERS pathway, antisenescence effects, and autophagy activation. Our findings suggest that spermidine could be a therapeutic agent for IPF treatment.",

Here we report that arginine metabolism is the most altered in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced fibrosis of the kidneys in metabolomic analysis. Spermidine is the most increased metabolite of arginine. In human glomerulonephritis, the amount of spermidine shown by immunostaining is associated with the amount of fibrosis. In human proximal tubule cells, spermidine induces nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Subsequently, fibrotic signals, such as transforming growth factor β1 secretion, collagen 1 mRNA, and oxidative stress, represented by a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential is suppressed by spermidine. UUO kidneys of Arg2 knockout mice show less spermidine and significantly exacerbated fibrosis compared with wild-type mice. Nrf2 activation is reduced in Arg2 knockout UUO kidneys. Spermidine treatment prevents significant fibrotic progression in Arg2 knockout mice. Spermidine is increased in kidney fibrosis, but further increases in spermidine may reduce fibrosis.",

The pathogenesis of IBS-D is thought to be related to a combination of factors, including psychological stress, abnormal muscle contractions, and inflammation and disorder of the gut microbiome. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis of the logical regulatory correlation among these factors. In this study, we found that stress induced hyperproduction of xanthine and altered the abundance and metabolic characteristics of Lactobacillus murinus in the gut. Lactobacillus murinus-derived spermidine suppressed the basal expression of type I interferon (IFN)-α in plasmacytoid dendritic cells by inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3. The reduction in IFN-α unrestricted the contractile function of colonic smooth muscle cells, resulting in an increase in bowel movement. Our findings provided a theoretical basis for the pathological mechanism of, and new drug targets for, stress-exposed IBS-D.",

L. reuteri ZJ617 serves as a source of substrates for the microbiota to synthesize spermidine, hence preventing the decline of bacteria responsible for spermidine production. Spermidine treatment mimics the metabolic effects of L. reuteri ZJ617, whereas pharmacological inhibition of spermidine biosynthesis in mice abolishes these benefits.

      "title": "Spermidine inhibits vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease through modulation of SIRT1 signaling pathway.",
      "abstract": "Vascular calcification is a common pathologic condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and aging individuals. It has been established that vascular calcification is a gene-regulated biological process resembling osteogenesis involving osteogenic differentiation. However, there is no efficient treatment available for vascular calcification so far. The natural polyamine spermidine has been demonstrated to increase life span and protect against cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether spermidine supplementation inhibits vascular calcification in CKD. Alizarin red staining and quantification of calcium content showed that spermidine treatment markedly reduced mineral deposition in both rat and human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) under osteogenic conditions. Additionally, western blot analysis revealed that spermidine treatment inhibited osteogenic differentiation of rat and human VSMCs. Moreover, spermidine treatment remarkably attenuated calcification of rat and human arterial rings ex vivo and aortic calcification in rats with CKD. Furthermore, treatment with spermidine induced the upregulation of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in VSMCs and resulted in the downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling components, such as activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP). Both pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 by SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and knockdown of SIRT1 by siRNA markedly blocked the inhibitory effect of spermidine on VSMC calcification. Consistently, EX527 abrogated the inhibitory effect of spermidine on aortic calcification in CKD rats. We for the first time demonstrate that spermidine alleviates vascular calcification in CKD by upregulating SIRT1 and inhibiting ER stress, and this may develop a promising therapeutic treatment to ameliorate vascular calcification in CKD.",

      "title": "Arginine metabolism regulates human erythroid differentiation through hypusination of eIF5A.",
      "abstract": "Metabolic programs contribute to hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) fate, but it is not known whether the metabolic regulation of protein synthesis controls HSPC differentiation. Here, we show that SLC7A1/cationic amino acid transporter 1-dependent arginine uptake and its catabolism to the polyamine spermidine control human erythroid specification of HSPCs via the activation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). eIF5A activity is dependent on its hypusination, a posttranslational modification resulting from the conjugation of the aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to lysine. Notably, attenuation of hypusine synthesis in erythroid progenitors, by the inhibition of deoxyhypusine synthase, abrogates erythropoiesis but not myeloid cell differentiation. Proteomic profiling reveals mitochondrial translation to be a critical target of hypusinated eIF5A, and accordingly, progenitors with decreased hypusine activity exhibit diminished oxidative phosphorylation. This affected pathway is critical for eIF5A-regulated erythropoiesis, as interventions augmenting mitochondrial function partially rescue human erythropoiesis under conditions of attenuated hypusination. Levels of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (RPs) were especially sensitive to the loss of hypusine, and we find that the ineffective erythropoiesis linked to haploinsufficiency of RPS14 in chromosome 5q deletions in myelodysplastic syndrome is associated with a diminished pool of hypusinated eIF5A. Moreover, patients with RPL11-haploinsufficient Diamond-Blackfan anemia as well as CD34+ progenitors with downregulated RPL11 exhibit a markedly decreased hypusination in erythroid progenitors, concomitant with a loss of mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, eIF5A-dependent protein synthesis regulates human erythropoiesis, and our data reveal a novel role for RPs in controlling eIF5A hypusination in HSPCs, synchronizing mitochondrial metabolism with erythroid differentiation.",

      "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of dementia is estimated at 35.6 million and will rise to 115 million by 2050. There is therefore an urgent need for well-founded dementia diagnostics and well-researched therapeutic options. Previous studies have highlighted that spermidine has the ability to trigger the important process of dissolving amyloid-beta plaques by autophagy. They also confirmed that nutritional intervention with the natural polyamine spermidine can prevent memory loss in aging model organisms. This multicentric double-blind preliminary study focused on the effect of oral spermidine supplementation on older adults' cognitive performance. Memory tests were carried out on 85 subjects aged between 60 and 96 years in 6 nursing homes in Styria. Blood samples were taken for the determination of spermidine concentration and measurement of metabolic parameters. The results demonstrated a clear correlation between the intake of spermidine and the improvement in cognitive performance in subjects with mild and moderate dementia in the group treated with the higher spermidine dosage. The most substantial improvement in test performance was found in the group of subjects with mild dementia with an increase of 2.23 points (p = 0.026) in the mini mental state examination (MMSE) and 1.99 (p = 0.47) in phonematic fluidity. By comparison, the group which had a lower spermidine intake showed consistent or declining cognitive performance.",

      "abstract": "The connection between amino acid metabolism and pyroptosis remains elusive. Herein, we screen the effect of individual amino acid on pyroptosis and identify that methionine inhibits GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Mechanistic analyses unveil that MYO6, a unique actin-based motor protein, bridges the GSDME N-terminus (GSDME-NT) and the endocytic adaptor AP2, mediating endolysosomal degradation of GSDME-NT. This degradation is increased by the methionine-derived metabolite spermidine noncanonically by direct binding to MYO6, which enhances MYO6 selectivity for GSDME-NT. Moreover, combination targeted therapies using dietary or pharmacological inhibition in methionine-to-spermidine metabolism in the tumor promotes pyroptosis and anti-tumor immunity, leading to a stronger tumor-suppressive effect in in vivo models. Clinically, higher levels of tumor spermidine and expression of methionine-to-spermidine metabolism-related gene signature predict poorer survival. Conclusively, our research identifies an unrecognized mechanism of pyroptotic resistance mediated by methionine-spermidine metabolic axis, providing a fresh angle for cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "Infectious diseases caused by trypanosomatids, including African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), Chagas disease, and different forms of leishmaniasis, are Neglected Tropical Diseases affecting millions of people worldwide, mainly in vulnerable territories of tropical and subtropical areas. In general, current treatments against these diseases are old-fashioned, showing adverse effects and loss of efficacy due to misuse or overuse, thus leading to the emergence of resistance. For these reasons, searching for new antitrypanosomatid drugs has become an urgent necessity, and different metabolic pathways have been studied as potential drug targets against these parasites. Considering that trypanosomatids possess a unique redox pathway based on the trypanothione molecule absent in the mammalian host, the key enzymes involved in trypanothione metabolism, trypanothione reductase and trypanothione synthetase, have been studied in detail as druggable targets. In this review, we summarize some of the recent findings on the molecules inhibiting these two essential enzymes for ",

      "abstract": "Glutaminolysis is a hallmark of the activation and metabolic reprogramming of T cells. Isotopic tracer analyses of antigen-activated effector CD8+ T cells revealed that glutamine is the principal carbon source for the biosynthesis of polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. These metabolites play critical roles in activation-induced T cell proliferation, as well as for the production of hypusine, which is derived from spermidine and is covalently linked to the translation elongation factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A). Here, we demonstrated that the glutamine/polyamine/hypusine axis controlled the expression of CD69, an important regulator of tissue-resident memory T cells (Trm). Inhibition of this circuit augmented the development of Trm cells ex vivo and in vivo in the BM, a well-established niche for Trm cells. Furthermore, blocking the polyamine/hypusine axis augmented CD69 expression as well as IFN-γ and TNF-α production in (a) human CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood and sarcoma tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and (b) human CD8+ CAR-T cells. Collectively, these findings support the notion that the polyamine-hypusine circuit can be exploited to modulate Trm cells for therapeutic benefit.",

      "abstract": "Acute nutrient deprivation (fasting) causes an immediate increase in spermidine biosynthesis in yeast, flies, mice and humans, as corroborated in four independent clinical studies. This fasting-induced surge in spermidine constitutes the critical first step of a phylogenetically conserved biochemical cascade that leads to spermidine-dependent hypusination of EIF5A (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), which favors the translation of the pro-macroautophagic/autophagic TFEB (transcription factor EB), and hence an increase in autophagic flux. We observed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the spermidine increase by inhibition of ODC1 (ornithine decarboxylase 1) prevents the pro-autophagic and antiaging effects of fasting in yeast, nematodes, flies and mice. Moreover, knockout or knockdown of the enzymes required for EIF5A hypusination abolish fasting-mediated autophagy enhancement and longevity extension in these organisms. Of note, autophagy and longevity induced by rapamycin obey the same rule, meaning that they are tied to an increase in spermidine synthesis. These findings indicate that spermidine is not only a \"caloric restriction mimetic\" in the sense that its supplementation mimics the beneficial effects of nutrient deprivation on organismal health but that it is also an obligatory downstream effector of the antiaging effects of fasting and rapamycin.",

Although CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 may be present in semen, almost exclusively CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 causes systemic infection after sexual intercourse. To identify factors that may limit sexual X4-HIV-1 transmission, we generated a seminal fluid-derived compound library and screened it for antiviral agents. We identified four adjacent fractions that blocked X4-HIV-1 but not R5-HIV-1 and found that they all contained spermine and spermidine, abundant polyamines in semen. We showed that spermine, which is present in semen at concentrations up to 14 mM, binds CXCR4 and selectively inhibits cell-free and cell-associated X4-HIV-1 infection of cell lines and primary target cells at micromolar concentrations. Our findings suggest that seminal spermine restricts sexual X4-HIV-1 transmission.",

Both dietary restriction, such as limiting protein intake, and fasting, which restricts the timing of food consumption, have been proposed as strategies to delay aspects of aging. Recent studies suggest that intermittent fasting effects are mediated by the endogenous polyamine spermidine. Spermidine supplementation promotes mitochondrial integrity and functionality in aging brains by supporting hypusination of the translational initiation factor eIF5A. However, how molecular mechanisms underlying fasting mimicking interventions and protein restriction converge remain unclear, yet biomedically relevant.

      "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease initiated and maintained by a rare subset of cells called leukemia stem cells (LSCs). LSCs are responsible for driving disease relapse, making the development of new therapeutic strategies to target LSCs urgently needed. The use of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling has enabled the discovery of unique and targetable metabolic properties in LSCs. However, we do not have a comprehensive understanding of metabolite differences between LSCs and their normal counterparts, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In this study, we used an unbiased mass spectrometry-based metabolomics analysis to define differences in metabolites between primary human LSCs and HSPCs, which revealed that LSCs have a distinct metabolome. Spermidine was the most enriched metabolite in LSCs compared with HSPCs. Pharmacological reduction of spermidine concentrations decreased LSC function but spared normal HSPCs. Polyamine depletion also decreased leukemic burden in patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, spermidine depletion induced LSC myeloid differentiation by decreasing eIF5A-dependent protein synthesis, resulting in reduced expression of a select subset of proteins. KAT7, a histone acetyltransferase, was one of the top candidates identified to be down-regulated by spermidine depletion. Overexpression of KAT7 partially rescued polyamine depletion-induced decreased colony-forming ability, demonstrating that loss of KAT7 is an essential part of the mechanism by which spermidine depletion targets AML clonogenic potential. Together, we identified and mechanistically dissected a metabolic vulnerability of LSCs that has the potential to be rapidly translated into clinical trials to improve outcomes for patients with AML.",

Spermidine (SPD), a naturally occurring polyamine, has shown potential in alleviating the accumulation of hepatic lipids and reducing NAFLD symptoms in overweight mice. Nonetheless, the specific mechanisms through which SPD exerts its effects remain largely unknown. This study seeks to explore the protective effects of SPD on NAFLD and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. An in vitro model of NAFLD was established by inducing steatosis in AML-12 cells through the use of free fatty acids (FFAs). Our experimental results demonstrate that SPD significantly reduces NAFLD development induced by FFAs. This reduction is primarily achieved through the inhibition of cellular ferroptosis, as evidenced by decreased levels of Fe",

      "title": "Trypanothione Metabolism as Drug Target for Trypanosomatids.",
      "abstract": "Chagas Disease, African sleeping sickness, and leishmaniasis are neglected diseases caused by pathogenic trypanosomatid parasites, which have a considerable impact on morbidity and mortality in poor countries. The available drugs used as treatment have high toxicity, limited access, and can cause parasite drug resistance. Long-term treatments, added to their high toxicity, result in patients that give up therapy. Trypanosomatids presents a unique trypanothione based redox system, which is responsible for maintaining the redox balance. Therefore, inhibition of these essential and exclusive parasite's metabolic pathways, absent from the mammalian host, could lead to the development of more efficient and safe drugs. The system contains different redox cascades, where trypanothione and tryparedoxins play together a central role in transferring reduced power to different enzymes, such as 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, non-selenium glutathione peroxidases, ascorbate peroxidases, glutaredoxins and methionine sulfoxide reductases, through NADPH as a source of electrons. There is sufficient evidence that this complex system is essential for parasite survival and infection. In this review, we explore what is known in terms of essentiality, kinetic and structural data, and the development of inhibitors of enzymes from this trypanothione-based redox system. The recent advances and limitations in the development of lead inhibitory compounds targeting these enzymes have been discussed. The combination of molecular biology, bioinformatics, genomics, and structural biology is fundamental since the knowledge of unique features of the trypanothione-dependent system will provide tools for rational drug design in order to develop better treatments for these diseases.",

      "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is common in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), even in the absence of cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that impaired mitophagy contributes to SLE. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also associated with impaired endothelial function. Spermidine, a natural polyamine, stimulates mitophagy by the PINK1-parkin pathway and counters age-associated endothelial dysfunction. However, the effect of spermidine on mitophagy and vascular function in SLE has not been explored. To address this gap, 9-week-old female lupus-prone (MRL/lpr) and healthy control (MRL/MpJ) mice were randomly assigned to spermidine treatment (lpr_Spermidine and MpJ_Spermidine) for 8 weeks or as control (lpr_Control and MpJ_Control). lpr_Control mice exhibited impaired endothelial function (e.g., decreased relaxation to acetylcholine), increased markers of inflammation, and lower protein content of parkin, a mitophagy marker, in the thoracic aorta. Spermidine treatment prevented endothelial dysfunction in MRL-lpr mice. Furthermore, aortas from lpr_Spermidine mice had lower levels of inflammatory markers and higher levels of parkin. Lupus phenotypes were not affected by spermidine. Collectively, these results demonstrate the beneficial effects of spermidine treatment on endothelial function, inflammation, and mitophagy in SLE mice. These results support future studies of the beneficial effects of spermidine on endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease risk in SLE.",

      "abstract": "Bachmann-Bupp syndrome (BABS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, and varying forms of non-congenital alopecia. The condition is caused by 3'-end mutations of the ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) gene, which produce carboxy (C)-terminally truncated variants of ODC, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme. C-terminal truncation of ODC prevents its ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and leads to cellular accumulation of ODC enzyme that remains catalytically active. ODC is the first rate-limiting enzyme that converts ornithine to putrescine in the polyamine pathway. Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, spermine) are aliphatic molecules found in all forms of life and are important during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and tumorigenesis. BABS is an ultra-rare condition with few reported cases, but it serves as a convincing example for drug repurposing therapy. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO, also known as eflornithine) is an ODC inhibitor with a strong safety profile in pediatric use for neuroblastoma and other cancers as well as West African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Patients with BABS have been treated with DFMO and have shown improvement in hair growth, muscle tone, and development.",

Here their effect on nucleosome stability, a key regulatory factor in eukaryotic gene control, is reported, as measured in agarose embedded nuclei of H2B-GFP expressor HeLa cells. Nucleosome stability was assessed by quantitative microscopy [1,2] in situ, in close to native state of chromatin, preserving the nucleosome constrained topology of the genomic DNA. A robust destabilizing effect was observed in the millimolar concentration range in the case of spermine, spermidine as well as putrescine, which was strongly pH and salt concentration-dependent, and remained significant also at neutral pH. The integrity of genomic DNA was not affected by PA treatment, excluding DNA break-elicited topological relaxation as a factor in destabilization. The binding of PAs to DNA was demonstrated by the displacement of ethidium bromide, both from deproteinized nuclear halos and from plasmid DNA. The possibility that DNA methylation patterns may be influenced by PA levels is contemplated in the context of gene expression and DNA methylation correlations identified in the NCI-60 panel-based CellMiner database: methylated loci in subsets of high-ODC1 cell lines and the dependence of PER3 DNA methylation on PA metabolism.",

      "abstract": "Autophagy is an abnormal protein degradation and recycling process that is impaired in various neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease. Spermidine is a natural polyamine found in various plant- and meat-based diets that can induce autophagy, and is decreased in various neurodegenerative diseases. It acts on epigenetic enzymes like E1A-binding protein p300, HAT enzymes like Iki3p and Sas3p, and α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 that modulate autophagy. Histone modifications like acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation could influence autophagy. Autophagy is epigenetically regulated in various neurodegenerative disorders with many epigenetic enzymes and miRNAs. Polyamine regulation plays an essential role in the disease pathogenesis of AD and PD. Therefore, in this review, we discuss various enzymes and miRNAs involved in the epigenetic regulation of autophagy in neurodegenerative disorders and the role of spermidine as an autophagy enhancer. The alterations in spermidine-mediated regulation of Beclin-1, LC3-II, and p62 genes in AD and other PD-associated enzymes could impact the process of autophagy in these neurodegenerative diseases. With the ever-growing data and such promising effects of spermidine in autophagy, we feel it could be a promising target in this area and worth further detailed studies.",

Polyamines produced by intestinal bacteria suppress chronic inflammation and enhance the intestinal barrier in the colon, and are also transferred into the blood via the colonic epithelium, resulting in significant improvement of host cognitive performance and life extension in mice. Upregulation of polyamine production by gut microbes can help compensate for the aging-associated decrease in polyamine content through the uptake of intestinal luminal polyamine, thereby extending the healthy life expectancy of the host. This review summarizes recent advances in the study of polyamine metabolism and transport in gut microbes, with particular reference to Escherichia coli and the most predominant species of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, we describe polyamine production by a novel hybrid system comprised of multiple gut microbes, as well as from high-polyamine-producing lactic acid bacteria derived from fermented foods.",

      "abstract": "Polyamines are polycationic molecules that are crucial in a wide array of cellular functions. Their biosynthesis is mediated by aminopropyl transferases (APTs), which are promising targets for antimicrobial, antineoplastic, and antineurodegenerative therapies. A major limitation in studying APT enzymes, however, is the lack of high-throughput assays to measure their activity. We have developed the first fluorescence-based assay, diacetyl benzene (DAB)-APT, for the measurement of APT activity using 1,2-DAB, which forms fluorescent conjugates with putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, with fluorescence intensity increasing with the carbon chain length. The assay has been validated using APT enzymes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Plasmodium falciparum, and the data further validated by mass spectrometry and TLC. Using mass spectrometry analysis, the structures of the fluorescent putrescine, spermidine, and spermine 1,2-DAB adducts were determined to be substituted 1,3-dimethyl isoindoles. The DAB-APT assay is optimized for high-throughput screening, facilitating the evaluation of large chemical libraries. Given the critical roles of APTs in infectious diseases, oncology, and neurobiology, the DAB-APT assay offers a powerful tool with broad applicability, poised to drive advancements in research and drug discovery.",

Cancer cells can directly affect the immune system, but the mechanisms driving these interactions are not completely clear. Here, we demonstrate that the polyamine metabolite spermidine (SPD) was elevated in the GBM tumor microenvironment. Exogenous administration of SPD drove tumor aggressiveness in an immune-dependent manner in preclinical mouse models via reduction of CD8+ T cell frequency and reduced cytotoxic function. Knockdown of ornithine decarboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in SPD synthesis, did not affect cancer cell growth in vitro but did result in extended survival. Furthermore, patients with GBM with a more favorable outcome had a significant reduction in SPD compared with patients with a poor prognosis. Our results demonstrate that SPD functions as a cancer cell-derived metabolite that drives tumor progression by reducing CD8+ T cell numbers and function.",

UA enhances cellular health by increasing mitophagy and mitochondrial function and reducing detrimental inflammation. Several preclinical studies show how UA protects against aging and age-related conditions affecting muscle, brain, joints, and other organs.

      "abstract": "The world is facing the new challenges of an aging population, and understanding the process of aging has therefore become one of the most important global concerns. Sarcopenia is a condition which is defined by the gradual loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with age. In research and clinical practice, sarcopenia is recognized as a component of geriatric disease and is a current target for drug development. In this review we define this condition and provide an overview of current therapeutic approaches. We further highlight recent findings that describe key pathophysiological phenotypes of this condition, including alterations in muscle fiber types, mitochondrial function, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) metabolism, myokines, and gut microbiota, in aged muscle compared to young muscle or healthy aged muscle. The last part of this review examines new therapeutic avenues for promising treatment targets. There is still no accepted therapy for sarcopenia in humans. Here we provide a brief review of the current state of research derived from various mouse models or human samples that provide novel routes for the development of effective therapeutics to maintain muscle health during aging.",

It remains unknown whether mitophagy, the essential selective autophagic degradation of mitochondria, also decreases with age. In our analysis of mitophagy in multiple organs in the mito-QC reporter mouse, mitophagy is either increased or unchanged in old versus young mice. Transcriptomic analysis shows marked upregulation of the type I interferon response in the retina of old mice, which correlates with increased levels of cytosolic mtDNA and activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. Crucially, these same alterations are replicated in primary human fibroblasts from elderly donors. In old mice, pharmacological induction of mitophagy with urolithin A attenuates cGAS/STING activation and ameliorates deterioration of neurological function. These findings point to mitophagy induction as a strategy to decrease age-associated inflammation and increase healthspan.",

      "title": "Neutrophil extracellular traps drive intestinal microvascular endothelial ferroptosis by impairing Fundc1-dependent mitophagy.",
      "abstract": "Microvascular endothelial damage caused by intestinal ischemia‒reperfusion (II/R) is a primary catalyst for microcirculation dysfunction and enterogenous infection. Previous studies have mainly focused on how neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and ferroptosis cause intestinal epithelial injury, and little attention has been given to how NETs, mainly from circulatory neutrophils, affect intestinal endothelial cells during II/R. This study aimed to unravel the mechanisms through which NETs cause intestinal microvascular dysfunction. We first detected heightened local NET infiltration around the intestinal microvasculature, accompanied by increased endothelial cell ferroptosis, resulting in microcirculation dysfunction in both human and animal II/R models. However, the administration of the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 or the inhibition of NETs via neutrophil-specific peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (Pad4) deficiency led to positive outcomes, with reduced intestinal endothelial ferroptosis and microvascular function recovery. Moreover, RNA-seq analysis revealed a significant enrichment of mitophagy- and ferroptosis-related signaling pathways in HUVECs incubated with NETs. Mechanistically, elevated NET formation induced Fundc1 phosphorylation at Tyr18 in intestinal endothelial cells, which led to mitophagy inhibition, mitochondrial quality control imbalance, and excessive mitochondrial ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, resulting in endothelial ferroptosis and microvascular dysfunction. Nevertheless, using the mitophagy activator urolithin A or AAV-Fundc1 transfection could reverse this process and ameliorate microvascular damage. We first demonstrate that increased NETosis could result in intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction and conclude that suppressed NET formation can mitigate intestinal endothelial ferroptosis by improving Fundc1-dependent mitophagy. Targeting NETs could be a promising approach for treating II/R-induced intestinal microcirculatory dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Diet provides energy and nutrition for human survival, and also provides various joy of taste. Extensive studies have shown that the major components of diet, such as protein, carbohydrate and fat, play important roles in regulating aging and longevity. Whether other dietary ingredients can help prevent aging and extend longevity is a very interesting question. Here based on recent findings, we discussed dietary plant ingredients that can extend longevity by regulation of metabolism, targeting TRP channels, mitophagy, senescence pathways and circadian rhythms. Better understanding of the detailed effects and mechanisms of dietary ingredients on longevity regulation, would be helpful for developing new intervention tools for preventing aging and aging related diseases.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is considered a leading cause of mortality and neurological disability, which puts a huge burden on individuals and the community. To date, effective therapy for stroke has been limited by its complex pathological mechanisms. Autophagy refers to an intracellular degrading process with the involvement of lysosomes. Autophagy plays a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis and survival of cells by eliminating damaged or non-essential cellular constituents. Increasing evidence support that autophagy protects neuronal cells from ischemic injury. However, under certain circumstances, autophagy activation induces cell death and aggravates ischemic brain injury. Diverse naturally derived compounds have been found to modulate autophagy and exert neuroprotection against stroke. In the present work, we have reviewed recent advances in naturally derived compounds that regulate autophagy and discussed their potential application in stroke treatment.",

      "abstract": "Urolithins, metabolites produced by the gut microbiota from the polyphenols ellagitannins and ellagic acid, are discovered by the research group in humans almost 20 years ago. Pioneering research suggests urolithins as pleiotropic bioactive contributors to explain the health benefits after consuming ellagitannin-rich sources (pomegranates, walnuts, strawberries, etc.). Here, this study comprehensively updates the knowledge on urolithins, emphasizing the review of the literature published during the last 5 years. To date, 13 urolithins and their corresponding conjugated metabolites (glucuronides, sulfates, etc.) have been described and, depending on the urolithin, detected in different human fluids and tissues (urine, blood, feces, breastmilk, prostate, colon, and breast tissues). There has been a substantial advance in the research on microorganisms involved in urolithin production, along with the compositional and functional characterization of the gut microbiota associated with urolithins metabolism that gives rise to the so-called urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, UM-B, and UM-0), relevant in human health. The design of in vitro studies using physiologically relevant assay conditions (molecular forms and concentrations) is still a pending subject, making some reported urolithin activities questionable. In contrast, remarkable progress has been made in the research on the safety, bioactivity, and associated mechanisms of urolithin A, including the first human interventions.",

      "title": "Sarcopenia in chronic liver disease: mechanisms and countermeasures.",
      "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a condition of low muscle mass, quality, and strength, is commonly found in patients with cirrhosis and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes including reduction in quality of life, increased mortality, and posttransplant complications. In chronic liver disease (CLD), sarcopenia is most commonly defined through the measurement of the skeletal muscle index of the third lumbar spine. A major contributor to sarcopenia in CLD is the imbalance in muscle protein turnover, which likely occurs due to a decrease in muscle protein synthesis and an elevation in muscle protein breakdown. This imbalance is assumed to arise due to several factors including accelerated starvation, hyperammonemia, amino acid deprivation, chronic inflammation, excessive alcohol intake, and physical inactivity. In particular, hyperammonemia is a key mediator of the liver-gut axis and is known to contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and an increase in myostatin expression. Currently, the use of nutritional interventions such as late-evening snacks, branched-chain amino acid supplementation, and physical activity have been proposed to help the management and treatment of sarcopenia. However, little evidence exists to comprehensively support their use in clinical settings. Several new pharmacological strategies, including myostatin inhibition and the nutraceutical Urolithin A, have recently been proposed to treat age-related sarcopenia and may also be of use in CLD. This review highlights the potential molecular mechanisms contributing to sarcopenia in CLD alongside a discussion of existing and potential new treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Nutraceutical activation of Sirt1: a review.",
      "abstract": "The deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), activated by calorie restriction and fasting, exerts several complementary effects on cellular function that are favourable to healthspan; it is often thought of as an 'anti-aging' enzyme. Practical measures which might boost Sirt1 activity are therefore of considerable interest. A number of nutraceuticals have potential in this regard. Nutraceuticals reported to enhance Sirt1 synthesis or protein expression include ferulic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, urolithin A, melatonin, astaxanthin, carnosic acid and neochlorogenic acid. The half-life of Sirt1 protein can be enhanced with the natural nicotinamide catabolite N1-methylnicotinamide. The availability of Sirt1's obligate substrate NAD+ can be increased in several ways: nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can function as substrates for NAD+ synthesis; activators of AMP-activated kinase-such as berberine-can increase expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which is rate limiting for NAD+ synthesis; and nutraceutical quinones such as thymoquinone and pyrroloquinoline quinone can boost NAD+ by promoting oxidation of NADH. Induced ketosis-as via ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides-can increase NAD+ in the brain by lessening the reduction of NAD+ mediated by glycolysis. Post-translational modifications of Sirt1 by O-GlcNAcylation or sulfonation can increase its activity, suggesting that administration of glucosamine or of agents promoting hydrogen sulfide synthesis may aid Sirt1 activity. Although resveratrol has poor pharmacokinetics, it can bind to Sirt1 and activate it allosterically-as can so-called sirtuin-activating compound drugs. Since oxidative stress can reduce Sirt1 activity in multiple ways, effective antioxidant supplementation that blunts such stress may also help preserve Sirt1 activity in some circumstances. Combination nutraceutical regimens providing physiologically meaningful doses of several of these agents, capable of activating Sirt1 in complementary ways, may have considerable potential for health promotion. Such measures may also amplify the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in non-diabetic disorders, as these benefits appear to reflect upregulation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase activities.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common age-related joint disorder with no effective therapy. According to the World Health Organization, OA affects over 500 million people and is characterized by degradation of cartilage and other joint tissues, severe pain, and impaired mobility. Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to OA pathology. However, interventions to rescue mitochondrial defects in human OA are not available. Urolithin A (Mitopure) is a natural postbiotic compound that promotes mitophagy and mitochondrial function and beneficially impacts muscle health in preclinical models of aging and in elderly and middle-aged humans. Here, we showed that Urolithin A improved mitophagy and mitochondrial respiration in primary chondrocytes from joints of both healthy donors and OA patients. Furthermore, Urolithin A reduced disease progression in a mouse model of OA, decreasing cartilage degeneration, synovial inflammation, and pain. These improvements were associated with increased mitophagy and mitochondrial content, in joints of OA mice. These findings indicate that UA promotes joint mitochondrial health, alleviates OA pathology, and supports Urolithin A's potential to improve mobility with beneficial effects on structural damage in joints.",

      "abstract": "The pursuit of enhanced health during aging has prompted the exploration of various strategies focused on reducing the decline associated with the aging process. A key area of this exploration is the management of mitochondrial dysfunction, a notable characteristic of aging. This review sheds light on the crucial role that small molecules play in augmenting healthy aging, particularly through influencing mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial oxidative damage, a significant aspect of aging, can potentially be lessened through interventions such as coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, and a variety of antioxidants. Additionally, this review discusses approaches for enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial unfolded protein response inducers like doxycycline, and agents that affect mitophagy, such as urolithin A, spermidine, trehalose, and taurine, which are vital for sustaining protein quality control. Of equal importance are methods for modulating mitochondrial energy production, which involve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide boosters, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase activators, and compounds like metformin and mitochondria-targeted tamoxifen that enhance metabolic function. Furthermore, the review delves into emerging strategies that encourage mitochondrial biogenesis. Together, these interventions present a promising avenue for addressing age-related mitochondrial degradation, thereby setting the stage for the development of innovative treatment approaches to meet this extensive challenge.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to DMD, yet the mechanisms by which this occurs remain elusive. Our data in experimental models and patients with DMD show that reduced expression of genes involved in mitochondrial autophagy, or mitophagy, contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitophagy markers were reduced in skeletal muscle and in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) of a mouse model of DMD. Administration of the mitophagy activator urolithin A (UA) rescued mitophagy in DMD worms and mice and in primary myoblasts from patients with DMD, increased skeletal muscle respiratory capacity, and improved MuSCs' regenerative ability, resulting in the recovery of muscle function and increased survival in DMD mouse models. These data indicate that restoration of mitophagy alleviates symptoms of DMD and suggest that UA may have potential therapeutic applications for muscular dystrophies.",

      "title": "Urolithin A protects human dermal fibroblasts from UVA-induced photoaging through NRF2 activation and mitophagy.",
      "abstract": "Photoaging, caused by exposure to sunlight and especially UVA, has been identified as one of the culprits for age-related skin deterioration. Here, we initially demonstrated that urolithin A (UroA), a metabolite derived from intestine microflora, possessed sufficient photoprotective capacity and attenuated UVA-induced senescent phenotypes in human fibroblasts, such as growth inhibition, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, breakdown of extracellular matrix, synthesis of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, UroA lessened the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which promoted the phosphorylation and afterwards nuclear translocation of NRF2, subsequently driving the activation of downstream antioxidative enzymes. In parallel, we proved that UroA restored mitochondrial function by induction of mitophagy, which was regulated by the SIRT3-FOXO3-PINK1-PARKIN network. Taken together, our results showed that UroA protected dermal fibroblast from UVA damage through NRF2/ARE activation and mitophagy process, thus supporting UroA as a potential therapeutic agent for photoaging.",

      "title": "Urolithin A suppresses high glucose-induced neuronal amyloidogenesis by modulating TGM2-dependent ER-mitochondria contacts and calcium homeostasis.",
      "abstract": "Hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients is a causative factor for amyloidogenesis and induces neuropathological changes, such as impaired neuronal integrity, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment. Regulation of mitochondrial calcium influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered a promising strategy for the prevention of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation that occurs in the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathogenesis in DM patients. Among the metabolites of ellagitannins that are produced in the gut microbiome, urolithin A has received an increasing amount of attention as a novel candidate with anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects in AD. Here, we investigated the effect of urolithin A on high glucose-induced amyloidogenesis caused by mitochondrial calcium dysregulation and mtROS accumulation resulting in neuronal degeneration. We also identified the mechanism related to mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) formation. We found that urolithin A-lowered mitochondrial calcium influx significantly alleviated high glucose-induced mtROS accumulation and expression of amyloid beta (Aβ)-producing enzymes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase-1 (BACE1), as well as Aβ production. Urolithin A injections in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model alleviated APP and BACE1 expressions, Tau phosphorylation, Aβ deposition, and cognitive impairment. In addition, high glucose stimulated MAM formation and transglutaminase type 2 (TGM2) expression. We first discovered that urolithin A significantly reduced high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. In addition, disruption of the AIP-AhR complex was involved in urolithin A-mediated suppression of high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. Markedly, TGM2 silencing inhibited inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1)-voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) interactions and prevented high glucose-induced mitochondrial calcium influx and mtROS accumulation. We also found that urolithin A or TGM2 silencing prevented Aβ-induced mitochondrial calcium influx, mtROS accumulation, Tau phosphorylation, and cell death in neuronal cells. In conclusion, we suggest that urolithin A is a promising candidate for the development of therapies to prevent DM-associated AD pathogenesis by reducing TGM2-dependent MAM formation and maintaining mitochondrial calcium and ROS homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Acetaminophen overdose is a leading cause of acute live failure worldwide. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), as the only antidote, is limited due to its narrow therapeutic time window. Here we demonstrated that Urolithin A (UA), a metabolite of ellagitannin natural products in the gastrointestinal flora, protected against acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI) and is superior to NAC in terms of dosage and therapeutical time window. Transcriptomics assay revealed that UA promotes mitophagy and activated Nrf2/ARE signaling in the liver. Consistent with that, mitophagy and Nrf2/ARE signaling were activated, with less oxidative stress in UA-treated liver. Subsequently, molecular docking and dynamics simulation study revealed a binding mode between UA and Nrf-2/Keap1 including the hydrogen-bonding network among oxygen atoms in UA with the Nrf-2/Keap1 residues Arg 415, Ser 508 and Ser 602, which in turn trigger Nrf2 nuclear translocation, subsequently leading to activation of Nrf-2 target genes (HO-1, NQO1). Of note, mitophagy inhibition failed to prevent the protection of UA against AILI, which instead was compromised with Nrf2 gene silencing both ",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis (OP) is characterized by decreased trabecular bone volume and microarchitectural deterioration in the medullary cavity. Urolithin A (UA) is a biologically active metabolite generated by the gut microbiota. UA is the measurable product considered the most relevant urolithin as the final metabolic product of polyphenolic compounds. Considering that catabolic effects mediated by the intestinal microbiota are highly involved in pathological bone disorders, exploring the biological influence and molecular mechanisms by which UA alleviates OP is crucial. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of UA administration on OP progression in the context of estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss. The in vivo results indicated that UA effectively reduced ovariectomy-induced systemic bone loss. In vitro, UA suppressed Receptor Activator for Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand (RANKL)-triggered osteoclastogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Signal transduction studies and sequencing analysis showed that UA significantly decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6 and TNF-α) in osteoclasts. Additionally, attenuation of inflammatory signaling cascades inhibited the NF-κB-activated NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, which eventually led to decreased cytoplasmic secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 and reduced expression of pyroptosis markers (NLRP3, GSDMD, and caspase-1). Consistent with this finding, an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor (MCC950) was employed to treat OP, and modulation of pyroptosis was found to ameliorate osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, suggesting that UA suppressed osteoclast formation by regulating the inflammatory signal-dependent pyroptosis pathway. Conceivably, UA administration may be a safe and promising therapeutic strategy for osteoclast-related bone diseases such as OP.",

      "abstract": "Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction play critical role in the pathogenic process of Parkinson's disease (PD). Mitophagy plays central role in mitochondrial quality control. Hence, regulation of microglial activation through mitophagy could be a valuable strategy in controlling microglia-mediated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Urolithin A (UA) is a natural compound produced by gut bacteria from ingested ellagitannins (ETs) and ellagic acid (EA). Several preclinical studies have reported the beneficial effects of UA on age-related conditions by increasing mitophagy and blunting excessive inflammatory responses. However, the specific role of UA in pathology of PD remains unknown. In this study, we showed that treatment with UA reduced the loss of dopaminergic neurons, ameliorated behavioral deficits and neuroinflammation in MPTP mouse model of PD. Further study revealed that UA promotes mitophagy, restores mitochondrial function and attenuate proinflammatory response in BV2 microglial cells exposed to LPS. Moreover, UA also reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activation both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, disruption of microglial mitophagy with pharmacological or genetic approach partly blunted the neuroprotective effects of UA in MPTP mouse model of PD. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that UA protects against dopaminergic neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. The mechanism may be related with its inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation via promoting mitophagy in microglia.",

      "abstract": "This research used network pharmacology, molecular docking, in vivo studies, and other techniques to investigate the biological activity and mechanism of action of urolithin A (UA) in treating combined allergic rhinitis and asthma syndrome (CARAS). Urolithin A and potential related targets of allergic rhinitis and asthma were searched from the public databases. Then, bioinformatics analyses were given to protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Subsequently, molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation were performed, aiming at predicting the binding of the active compound to the core target. Finally, in vivo experiment was conducted for further validation. A total of 45 common targets of allergic rhinitis and urolithin A and 62 common targets of asthma and urolithin A were identified, among which six common core targets were screened with Cytoscape. Molecular docking indicated that these core targets had good binding activity to urolithin A, which was further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation. In the CARAS mouse model, urolithin A showed anti-inflammatory properties. The biological activity and regulatory network of UA on CARAS were revealed, and the anti-inflammatory effect of UA was clarified, which could be associated with the equilibrium of the immune system's Th1/Th2 cells.",

Traditional classifications of macrophage phenotypes include the pro-inflammatory M1 and the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes.

Different nutraceuticals focus on the polarization of M1/M2 phenotypes of microglia and macrophages, offering a potent defense against neurodegeneration. Caeminaxin A, curcumin, aromatic-turmerone, myricetin, aurantiamide, 3,6'-disinapoylsucrose, and resveratrol reduced M1 microglial inflammatory markers while increased M2 indicators in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid beta-induced microglial M1 activation was suppressed by andrographolide, sulforaphane, triptolide, xanthoceraside, piperlongumine, and novel plant extracts which also prevented microglia-mediated necroptosis and apoptosis.

Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with the development of ALD, with the gut microbial metabolite urolithin A (UA) exhibiting a potential for alleviating liver symptoms. However, the protective efficacy of UA against ALD and its underlying mechanism mediated by microbiota remain elusive. In this study, we provide evidence demonstrating that UA effectively ameliorates alcohol-induced metabolic disorders and hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through a specific gut-microbiota-liver axis mediated by major urinary protein 1 (MUP1).

Ellagic acid (EA), rich in pomegranate, shows promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in SAP treatment. However, the roles of other forms of EA, such as plant extracellular vesicles (EVs) extracted from pomegranate, and Urolithin A (UA), converted from EA through gut microbiota metabolism in vivo, have not been definitively elucidated. Our research aimed to compare the effects of pomegranate-derived EVs (P-EVs) and UA in the treatment of SAP to screen an effective formulation and to explore its mechanisms in protecting acinar cells in SAP. By comparing the protective effects of P-EVs and UA on injured acinar cells, UA showed superior therapeutic effects than P-EVs. Subsequently, we further discussed the mechanism of UA in alleviating SAP inflammation. In vivo animal experiments found that UA could not only improve the inflammatory environment of pancreatic tissue and peripheral blood circulation in SAP mice but also revealed that the mechanism of UA in improving SAP might be related to mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the results including pancreatic tissue transcriptomics and transmission electron microscopy. Further research found that UA could regulate ER-mitochondrial calcium channels and reduce pancreatic tissue necroptosis. In vitro experiments of mouse pancreatic organoids and acinar cells also confirmed that UA could improve pancreatic inflammation by regulating the ER-mitochondrial calcium channel and necroptosis pathway proteins. This study not only explored the therapeutic effect of plant EVs on SAP but also revealed that UA could alleviate SAP by regulating ER-mitochondrial calcium channel and reducing acinar cell necroptosis, providing insights into the pathogenesis and potential treatment of SAP.",

      "abstract": "The aging of an organism is hallmarked by systemic loss of functional tissue, resulting in increased fragility and eventual development of age-related neurodegenerative, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. Growing scientific evidence points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a key contributor in the aging process and subsequent development of age-related pathologies. Under normal physiologic conditions, the body removes dysfunctional mitochondria via an autophagic process known as mitophagy. Urolithin A (UA), a metabolite produced when gut microflora digests the polyphenol compounds ellagitannin and ellagic acid, is a known inducer of mitophagy via several identified mechanisms of action. The primary objective of this scoping review is to identify and summarize the clinical relevance of UA supplementation in the prevention of age-related pathology and diseases. A computer-assisted literature review was performed using PubMed and EMBASE for primary source research articles examining UA supplementation and aging-related pathologies. A total of 293 articles were initially identified from a database search, and 15 articles remained for inclusion in this review, based on predetermined criteria. Analysis of the 15 identified publications demonstrated that UA holds potential as a dietary intervention for slowing the progression of aging and preventing the development of age-related disease. This review also illustrates the potential role that mitochondrial health and inflammation play in the progression of age-related pathology. Identifying the clinical relevance of UA supplementation in the prevention of age-related pathology and diseases will help further the focus of research on treatments that may improve the longevity and quality of life in patients at risk for these comorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Dietary phenolic acids alleviate intestinal inflammation through altering gut microbiota composition and regulating macrophage activation. However, it is unclear how individual phenolic acids affect the interactions between intestinal microbiota and macrophages in the context of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we aim to elucidate the mechanism by which phenolic acids alleviate gut inflammation. Mice with or without depletion of macrophages were administered with four individual phenolic acids including chlorogenic, ferulic, caffeic, and ellagic acids, following dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment. Gut microbiota depletion and fecal microbiota transplantation were further performed in mice to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in phenolic acid-mediated protective effect. Colitis severity was evaluated using histological, serological, and immunological measurements. Absence of intestinal microbiota and macrophage deteriorate the epithelial injury in DSS colitis. Chlorogenic acid mitigated colitis by reducing M1 macrophage polarization through suppression of pyruvate kinase M 2 (Pkm2)-dependent glycolysis and inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (Nlrp3) activation. However, ferulic acid-mediated reduction of colitis was neutrophil-dependent through diminishing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps. On the other hand, the beneficial effects of caffeic acid and ellagic acid were dependent upon the gut microbiota. In fact, urolithin A (UroA), a metabolite transformed from ellagic acid by the gut microbiota, was found to alleviate colitis and enhance gut barrier function in an IL22-dependent manner. Overall, our findings demonstrated that the mechanisms by which phenolic acid protected against colitis were resulted from the interaction between gut microbiota and macrophage-neutrophil.",

      "title": "Mitochondria as Nutritional Targets to Maintain Muscle Health and Physical Function During Ageing.",
      "abstract": "The age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and physical function leads to a loss of independence and an increased reliance on health-care. Mitochondria are crucial in the aetiology of sarcopenia and have been identified as key targets for interventions that can attenuate declines in physical capacity. Exercise training is a primary intervention that reduces many of the deleterious effects of ageing in skeletal muscle quality and function. However, habitual levels of physical activity decline with age, making it necessary to implement adjunct treatments to maintain skeletal muscle mitochondrial health and physical function. This review provides an overview of the effects of ageing and exercise training on human skeletal muscle mitochondria and considers several supplements that have plausible mechanistic underpinning to improve physical function in ageing through their interactions with mitochondria. Several supplements, including MitoQ, urolithin A, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFAs), and a combination of glycine and N-acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) can improve physical function in older individuals through a variety of inter-dependent mechanisms including increases in mitochondrial biogenesis and energetics, decreases in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species emission and oxidative damage, and improvements in mitochondrial quality control. While there is evidence that some nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors can improve physical function in older individuals, such an outcome seems unrelated to and independent of changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. Future research should investigate the safety and efficacy of compounds that can improve skeletal muscle health in preclinical models through mechanisms involving mitochondria, such as mitochondrial-derived peptides and mitochondrial uncouplers, with a view to extending the human health-span.",

In ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, there is an excessive chronic inflammation with massive accumulation of leukocytes in the gut, in an attempt to constrain the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms on the damaged organ. Accordingly, it is known that dietary components, xenobiotics, and some chemicals or metabolites can activate AHR and induce the modulation of inflammatory responses. In fact, the AHR triggering by specific ligands during inflammatory conditions results in decreased IFNγ, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, IL-7, and IL-17, along with reduced microbial translocation and fibrosis in the gut. Moreover, upon AHR activation, there are increased regulatory mechanisms such as IL-10, IL-22, prostaglandin E",

      "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment often involves systemic administration of anti-inflammatory drugs or biologics such as anti-TNF-α antibodies. However, current drug therapies suffer from limited efficacy due to unresponsiveness and adverse side effects. To address these challenges, we developed inflammation-targeting nanoparticles (ITNPs) using biopolymers derived from the gum kondagogu (Cochlospermum gossypium) plant. These ITNPs enable selective drug delivery to inflamed regions, offering improved therapeutic outcomes. We designed ITNPs that specifically bind to inflamed regions in both human and mouse intestines, facilitating more effective, uniform, and prolonged drug delivery within the inflamed tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated that oral administration of ITNPs loaded with urolithin A (UroA), a microbial metabolite or its synthetic analogue UAS03 significantly attenuated chemical- and immune checkpoint inhibitor- induced colitis in pre-clinical models. In conclusion, ITNPs show great promise for delivering UroA or its analogues while enhancing therapeutic efficacy at lower doses and reduced frequency compared to free drug administration. This targeted approach offers a potential solution to enhance IBD treatment while minimizing systemic side effects.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex pathophysiology and a range of symptoms. The prevalence increases with age, putting the ageing population at risk. Disease management includes the improvement of symptoms, the comfort of the patient's life, and palliative care. As there is currently no cure, growing evidence points towards the beneficial role of polyphenols on neurodegeneration. Numerous studies indicate the health benefits of the family of urolithins, especially urolithin A (UA). UA is a bacterial metabolite produced by dietary ellagitannins and ellagic acid. An expanding body of literature explores the involvement of the compound in mitochondrial health, and its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. The review organizes the existing knowledge on the role of UA in health and diseases, emphasizing neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD. We gathered data on the potential neuroprotective effect in in vivo and in vitro models. We discussed the possible mechanisms of action of the compound and related health benefits to give a broader perspective of potential applications of UA in neuroprotective strategies. Moreover, we projected the future directions of applying UA in PD management.",

      "abstract": "Autophagy is the process by which cell contents, such as aggregated proteins, dysfunctional organelles, and cell structures are sequestered by autophagosome and delivered to lysosomes for degradation. As a process that allows the cell to get rid of non-functional components that tend to accumulate with age, autophagy has been associated with many human diseases. In this regard, the search for autophagy activators and the study of their mechanism of action is an important task for treatment of many diseases, as well as for increasing healthy life expectancy. Plants are rich sources of autophagy activators, containing large amounts of polyphenolic compounds in their composition, which can be autophagy activators in their original form, or can be metabolized by the intestinal microbiota to active compounds. This review is devoted to the plant-based autophagy activators with emphasis on the sources of their production, mechanism of action, and application in various diseases. The review also describes companies commercializing natural autophagy activators.",

Over 50% of patients with CPH treated with current clinical pharmacotherapy still present variceal bleeding or sometimes death owing to insufficient reduction in portal pressure. Elevated intrahepatic vascular resistance (IHVR) plays a fundamental role in increasing portal pressure. Because of its potent effect in reducing portal pressure and maintaining normal portal inflow to preserve liver function, lowering the IHVR is acknowledged as an optimal anti-CPH strategy but without clinical drugs. We aimed to investigate the protective effect of microbial-derived Urolithin A (UroA) in IHVR and CPH.",

      "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been demonstrated to exert a significant role in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which constitutes a crucial cause of AMI. Ferroptosis represents a novel form of cell death that is intimately linked to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) injury. Urolithin A (UA), an intestinal metabolite of ellagitannins, has not been fully elucidated for its role in MIR injury. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of UA on ischemia-reperfusion-induced oxidative stress and ferroptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and explored the potential mechanisms of UA action. The results indicated that UA was capable of protecting the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury and enhancing cardiac function both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, UA also attenuated oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, and ferroptosis during MIR. Mechanistically, UA not only augmented the Nrf2 expression but also promoted Nrf2 entry into the nucleus and activated the downstream antioxidant defense system. Moreover, after the inhibition of Nrf2, the myocardial protective function of UA was lost, and its function of attenuating oxidative stress and ferroptosis was suppressed. In conclusion, we found that UA protected the heart from ischemia-reperfusion injury by attenuating oxidative stress and ferroptosis through the Nrf2 signaling pathway, suggesting that UA might be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AMI.",
