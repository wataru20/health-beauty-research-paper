      "title": "Skin ageing and topical rejuvenation strategies.",
      "abstract": "Skin ageing is a complex process involving the additive effects of skin's interaction with its external environment, predominantly chronic sun exposure, upon a background of time-dependent intrinsic ageing. Skin health and beauty is considered one of the principal factors perceived to represent overall 'health and wellbeing'; thus, the demand for skin rejuvenation strategies has rapidly increased, with a worldwide annual expenditure expected to grow from $US24.6 billion to around $US44.5 billion by 2030 (https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-facial-rejuvenation-market). Skin rejuvenation can be achieved in several ways, ranging from laser and device-based treatments to chemical peels and injectables; however, topical skin care regimes are a mainstay treatment for ageing skin and all patients seeking skin rejuvenation can benefit from this relatively low-risk intervention. While the most efficacious topical rejuvenation treatment is application of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) - a prescription-only medicine considered to be the clinical 'gold standard' - a hybrid category of 'cosmeceutical' products at the midpoint of the spectrum of cosmetics and pharmaceutical has emerged. This article reviews the clinical manifestations of skin ageing and the available topical treatments for skin rejuvenation, including retinoids, peptides and antioxidants.",

      "abstract": "The interplay between the skin microbiome and its host is a complex facet of dermatological health and has become a critical focus in the development of microbiome cosmetics. The skin microbiome, comprising various microorganisms, is essential from birth, develops over the lifespan, and performs vital roles in protecting our body against pathogens, training the immune system, and facilitating the breakdown of organic matter. Dysbiosis, an imbalance of these microorganisms, has been implicated in a number of skin conditions such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and skin cancer. Recent scientific findings have spurred cosmetic companies to develop products that preserve and enhance the skin's microbial diversity balance. These products may incorporate elements like prebiotics, probiotics, and postbiotics, which are beneficial for the skin microbiome. Beyond topical products, there's increasing interest in ingestible beauty supplements (i.e. oral probiotics), highlighting the connection between the gut and skin. This review examines the influence of the microbiome on skin health and the emerging trends of microbiome skincare products.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells derived from adult stem cells. Primary MSCs can be obtained from diverse sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood. Recently, MSCs have been recognized as therapeutic agents for skin regeneration and rejuvenation. The skin can be damaged by wounds, caused by cutting or breaking of the tissue, and burns. Moreover, skin aging is a process that occurs naturally but can be worsened by environmental pollution, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and undernourishment. MSCs have healing capacities that can be applied in damaged and aged skin. In skin regeneration, MSCs increase cell proliferation and neovascularization, and decrease inflammation in skin injury lesions. In skin rejuvenation, MSCs lead to production of collagen and elastic fibers, inhibition of metalloproteinase activation, and promote protection from ultraviolet radiation-induced senescence. In this review, we focus on how MSCs and MSC-derived molecules improve diseased and aged skin. Additionally, we emphasize that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MSCs are potentially advanced MSCs, which are suitable for cell therapy.",

Cosmetic-containing herbals are topical cosmetic-pharmaceutical hybrids intended to enhance the health and beauty of the skin. Cosmetic-containing herbals improve appearance by delivering essential nutrients to the skin. Several herbal products, such as cosmetic-containing herbals, are available. The present review highlights the use of natural products in cosmetic-containing herbals, as natural products have many curative effects as well as healing effects on skin and hair growth with minimal to no side effects. A brief description is given on such plants, their used parts, active ingredients, and the therapeutic properties associated with them. Mainly, the utilization of phytoconstituents as cosmetic-containing herbals in the care of skin and hair, such as dryness of skin, acne, eczema, inflammation of the skin, aging, hair growth, and dandruff, along with natural ingredients, such as for hair colorant, are explained in detail in the present review.",

Still, there appear to be universally accepted physical characteristics of beauty that span different cultures. Human beings have an inherent ability to distinguish between attractive and nonattractive based on physical features that include facial averageness, symmetry, skin homogeneity, and sexual dimorphism (sex-typical characteristics). Although beauty standards have changed over time, youthful appearance has remained a permanent influential component of facial attractiveness. Each person's perception of beauty is influenced by environment and perceptual adaptation, an experience-based process. Perception of beauty varies by race and ethnicity. We discuss typical features of White, Asian, Black, and Latino beauty. We also review the effects of globalization on spreading foreign beauty culture and discuss how social media change traditional beauty stereotypes within the different races and ethnicities.",

      "title": "The New Challenge of Green Cosmetics: Natural Food Ingredients for Cosmetic Formulations.",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, much attention is paid to issues such as ecology and sustainability. Many consumers choose \"green cosmetics\", which are environmentally friendly creams, makeup, and beauty products, hoping that they are not harmful to health and reduce pollution. Moreover, the repeated mini-lock downs during the COVID-19 pandemic have fueled the awareness that body beauty is linked to well-being, both external and internal. As a result, consumer preferences for makeup have declined, while those for skincare products have increased. Nutricosmetics, which combines the benefits derived from food supplementation with the advantages of cosmetic treatments to improve the beauty of our body, respond to the new market demands. Food chemistry and cosmetic chemistry come together to promote both inside and outside well-being. A nutricosmetic optimizes the intake of nutritional microelements to meet the needs of the skin and skin appendages, improving their conditions and delaying aging, thus helping to protect the skin from the aging action of environmental factors. Numerous studies in the literature show a significant correlation between the adequate intake of these supplements, improved skin quality (both aesthetic and histological), and the acceleration of wound-healing. This review revised the main foods and bioactive molecules used in nutricosmetic formulations, their cosmetic effects, and the analytical techniques that allow the dosage of the active ingredients in the food.",

      "abstract": "Higher demands on skin care cosmetic products for strong performance drive intense research to understand the mechanisms of skin aging and design strategies to improve overall skin health. Today we know that our needs and influencers of skin health and skin aging change throughout our life journey due to both extrinsic factors, such as environmental factors and lifestyle factors, as well as our intrinsic factors. Furthermore, we need to consider our microflora, a collection of micro-organisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which is a living ecosystem in our gut and on our skin, that can have a major impact on our health. Here, we are viewing a holistic approach to understand the collective effect of the key influencers of skin health and skin aging both reviewing how each of them impact the skin, but more importantly to identify molecular conjunction pathways of these different factors in order to get a better understanding of the integrated \"genome-microbiome-exposome\" effect. For this purpose and in order to translate molecularly the impact of the key influencers of skin health and skin aging, we built a digital model based on system biology using different bioinformatics tools. This model is considering both the positive and negative impact of our genome (genes, age/gender), exposome: external (sun, pollution, climate) and lifestyle factors (sleep, stress, exercise, nutrition, skin care routine), as well as the role of our skin microbiome, and allowed us in a first application to evaluate the effect of the genome in the synthesis of collagen in the skin and the determination of a suitable target for boosting pro-collagen synthesis. In conclusion, we have, through our digital holistic approach, defined the skin interactome concept, as an advanced tool to better understand the molecular genesis of skin aging and further develop a strategy to balance the influence of the exposome and microbiome to protect, prevent, and delay the appearance of skin aging signs and preserve good skin health condition. In addition, this model will aid in identifying and optimizing skin treatment options based on external triggers, as well as helping to design optimal treatments modulating the intrinsic pathways.",

      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by eczematous and pruritic skin lesions. In recent decades, the prevalence of AD has increased worldwide, most notably in developing countries. The enormous progress in our understanding of the complex composition and functions of the epidermal barrier allows for a deeper appreciation of the active role that the skin barrier plays in the initiation and maintenance of skin inflammation. The epidermis forms a physical, chemical, immunological, neuro-sensory, and microbial barrier between the internal and external environment. Not only lesional, but also non-lesional areas of AD skin display many morphological, biochemical and functional differences compared with healthy skin. Supporting this notion, genetic defects affecting structural proteins of the skin barrier, including filaggrin, contribute to an increased risk of AD. There is evidence to suggest that natural environmental allergens and man-made pollutants are associated with an increased likelihood of developing AD. A compromised epidermal barrier predisposes the skin to increased permeability of these compounds. Numerous topical and systemic therapies for AD are currently available or in development; while anti-inflammatory therapy is central to the treatment of AD, some existing and novel therapies also appear to exert beneficial effects on skin barrier function. Further research on the skin barrier, particularly addressing epidermal differentiation and inflammation, lipid metabolism, and the role of bacterial communities for skin barrier function, will likely expand our understanding of the complex etiology of AD and lead to identification of novel targets and the development of new therapies.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide (NAM), a NAM adenine dinucleotide precursor, is known for its benefits to skin health. Under standard culture conditions, NAM delays the differentiation and enhances the proliferation of human primary keratinocytes, leading to the maintenance of stem cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of NAM on photoaging in two-dimensional human primary keratinocyte cultures and three-dimensional organotypic epidermal models. In both models, we found that UVB irradiation and hydrogen peroxide induced human primary keratinocyte premature terminal differentiation and senescence. In three-dimensional organotypics, the phenotype was characterized by a thickening of the granular layer expressing filaggrin and loricrin, but thinning of the epidermis overall. NAM limited premature differentiation and ameliorated senescence, as evidenced by the maintenance of lamin B1 levels in both models, with decreased lipofuscin staining and reduced IL-6/IL-8 secretion in three-dimensional models, compared to those in UVB-only controls. In addition, DNA damage observed after irradiation was accompanied by a decline in energy metabolism, whereas both effects were partially prevented by NAM. Our data thus highlight the protective effects of NAM against photoaging and oxidative stress in the human epidermis and pinpoint DNA repair and energy metabolism as crucial underlying mechanisms.",

      "title": "Overview of Peptides and Their Potential Roles in Skin Health and Beauty.",
      "abstract": "Peptides are molecules that consist of at least two amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The difference between peptides and proteins is primarily based on size and structure. Typically, oligopeptides consist of fewer than about 10-20 amino acids, and polypeptides consist of more than 20 amino acids, whereas proteins usually are made up more than 50 amino acids and often contain multiple peptide subunits as stated in the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry rules. Beyond the nutritional properties, peptides are also structural components of hormones, enzymes, toxins, and antibiotics and play several fundamental physiological roles in the body. Since the introduction of the first commercial peptide drug, insulin, peptide-based drugs have gained increased interest. So far, more than 80 peptide-based drugs have reached the market for a wide range of conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and urological disorders. Meanwhile, peptides have also gained significant attention in the cosmetic industry because of their potential in boosting skin health. In this review, peptides were comprehensively summarized in the aspects of sources, function, the use of peptides in cosmetics and skin care, and indications for the delivery of cosmetic peptides.",

In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral supplementation with hydrolyzed fish cartilage for the improvement of chronological and photoaging-induced skin changes. A total of 46 healthy females aged 45 to 59 years were enrolled and divided into two groups: G1-placebo and G2-oral treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage. Measurements of skin wrinkles, dermis echogenicity and thickness, and morphological and structural characteristics of the skin were performed in the nasolabial region of the face before and after a 90-day period of treatment using high-resolution imaging, ultrasound, and reflectance confocal microscopy image analyses. A significant reduction in wrinkles and an increase of dermis echogenicity were observed after a 90-day period of treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage compared to the placebo and baseline values. In addition, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) image analysis showed improved collagen morphology and reduced elastosis after treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage. The present study showed the clinical benefits for the skin obtained with oral supplementation with a low dose of collagen peptides from hydrolyzed fish cartilage.",

      "abstract": "The inevitable attrition of skin due to ultraviolet radiation, termed photoaging, can be partially restored by treatment with retinoid compounds. Photoaged skin in lightly pigmented individuals, clinically presents with the appearance of wrinkles, increased laxity, and hyper- and hypopigmentation. Underlying these visible signs of ageing are histological features such as epidermal thinning, dermal-epidermal junction flattening, solar elastosis and loss of the dermal fibrillin microfibrillar network, fibrillar collagen and glycosaminoglycans. Retinoid compounds are comprised of three main generations with the first generation (all-trans retinoic acid, retinol, retinaldehyde and retinyl esters) primarily used for the clinical and cosmetic treatment of photoaging, with varying degrees of efficacy, tolerance and stability. All-trans retinoic acid is considered the 'gold standard' for skin rejuvenation; however, it is a prescription-only product largely confined to clinical use. Therefore, retinoid derivatives are readily incorporated into cosmeceutical formulations. The literature reported in this review suggests that retinol, retinyl esters and retinaldehyde that are used in many cosmeceutical products, are efficacious, safe and well-tolerated. Once in the skin, retinoids utilize a complex signalling pathway that promotes remodelling of photoaged epidermis and dermis and leads to the improvement of the cutaneous signs of photoaging.",

      "abstract": "Gel manicures have become part of a popular personal care service in the last two decades due to increased longevity of the polish and the added strength to the nail plate. Prolonged exposure to nail ultraviolet (UV) lamps is required to cure the gel polish. Despite the increased use of UV nail lamps, there is limited consensus in the literature on the risk of skin malignancy associated with UV nail lamps. The objective of this article was to provide a systematic review of the risk of skin malignancy associated with the use of UV nail lamps and to synthesize evidence-based recommendations on their safe usage. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the databases, Medline and Embase, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 2,331 non-duplicate articles. Nine were ultimately included, of which three were case reports, one was a cross-sectional study, and five were experimental studies. The risk of bias per the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was high or unclear, likely due to the number of case reports included. Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV nail lamps may pose a low risk of skin cancer. It is important to note that the available evidence is weak, and patients should be informed about the limited data to make their own decisions. Dermatologists and other healthcare providers should be updated with the latest evidence to address patients' concerns about gel manicures and suggest practices which can effectively reduce the risk of cutaneous malignancy associated with gel manicures, such as the use of UV-blocking gloves or properly applied sunscreens.",

      "abstract": "Skin bleaching, also known as skin lightening, is the deliberate lightening of an individual's skin tone without medical supervision. The causes are complex, multifactorial and often intertwined, although the unifying themes centre around a belief that lighter skin denotes an individual of higher status, socioeconomic background or physical beauty, than their darker-skinned counterpart. Skin lightening is achieved using agents that block the production of melanin and often contain drugs such as hydroquinone, superpotent topical steroids or mercury. These drugs can cause serious local and systemic complication. Skin-lightening compounds are illegal in most countries throughout the world; however the industry is worth billions of dollars annually, and the agents can be easily obtained by individuals seeking to lighten their skin. Dermatologists are in a unique position to identify those at risk of using skin-bleaching agents, manage complications and give advice on the physiological variation in pigmentation and how to avoid using skin-lightening agents to treat dermatological conditions. To manage the belief that lighter skin is better, societal level change is required to ensure that people of all skin tones are represented in the media.",

      "title": "Role of Molecular Hydrogen in Skin Diseases and its Impact in Beauty.",
      "abstract": "In today's society, healthy skin and a beautiful appearance are considered the foundation of general well-being. The skin is the largest organ of the body and plays an important role in protecting it against various hazards such as environmental, physical, chemical, and biological hazards. These factors include mediators that lead to oxidation reactions that produce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species and additional oxidants in the skin cells. An increase in oxidants beyond the antioxidant capacity of its defense system causes oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in the body. This response can cause further disruption of collagen fibers and hinder the functioning of skin cells that may result in the development of various skin diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and aging. In this review, we summarized the present information related to the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of dermatological disorders, and its impact on physical beauty and the daily lives of patients. We also discussed how molecular hydrogen exhibits a therapeutic effect against skin diseases via its effects on oxidative stress. Furthermore, findings from this summary review indicate that molecular hydrogen might be an effective treatment modality for the prevention and treatment of skin-related illnesses.",

      "title": "Challenges in Sun Protection.",
      "abstract": "Since time immemorial, people protected themselves from solar radiation. Limiting time in the sun by seeking shade or wearing clothing was a matter of course. In the early 20th century, tanned skin - a result of exposure to sunlight - was associated with good health. At the same time, however, one also had to protect oneself against the potential of excessive exposure to avoid sunburns. Around 1945, the first sunscreen products for protection against solar radiation became available. In the years to follow and up to the recent past, a vast number of different sunscreen filters were developed and incorporated into a wide variety of product formats. Frameworks regulating filter substances and preparations and methods to characterize sunscreen products' performance parameters were developed. Over the past 50-70 years, the perception regarding the tasks of sunscreen products changed several times. It was initially promoted as a lifestyle product and had the task of preventing sun-related erythema (tan without burn). Later, the prevention of skin cancer was added. Only in recent times, sunscreen products have been increasingly advertised and perceived as beauty and lifestyle products again. Also, the use of sunscreen products for antiaging purposes is now commonplace. The different intended purposes (averting harm and prevention) and the widespread use of topical sunscreen products have promoted many investigations and generated a vast and ongoing need for consumer and patient information and education. In the following review, we analyze and discuss current topics from conflicting areas, such as sun protection products (e.g., ideal sun protection products, sun protection metrics), product safety (e.g., nanoparticulate sunscreen filters, regulatory issues), application in everyday life (e.g., wish to tan, vulnerable cohorts), as well as controversies and future challenges (e.g., risks and benefits of UV radiation).",

To select suitable cosmetic products and procedures that help ensure healthy and beautiful skin, clinicians must consider the patient's skin type. An individualized classification of skin types allows the clinician to develop personalized skin care recommendations that consider an individual's genetic and physiological characteristics. In the fields of dermatology and aesthetics, the classification of skin types is the basis for scientific research. Skin type classification systems are additionally important for both dermatologists and aesthetic practitioners because they influence the selection of cosmetic products, procedures, and treatments. The purpose of this paper was to provide a detailed review and evaluation of the relevance, suitability, and benefits of the new ABCD Classification of Skin Types, to compare it with other systems for classifying skin types, and to identify parameters for its improvement.",

Long-term dermatological treatment, which often lasts years, and disease relapses contribute to the occurrence of low self-esteem and depression. Acne is one of the 10 most common diseases in the world and the most common inflammatory skin disease. Many methods of dermatological treatment that bring very good results are available. However, educating people with acne on how to take care of their skin on a daily basis to minimize the bleak effects of the disease is an extremely important element. Contemporary cosmetology creates an environment for not only taking care of the skin at home, but also develops in-office treatments with exfoliation of the dead epidermis as an extremely important and priority part of treatment. The cosmetologist can propose both chemical and apparatus methods, which are selected individually for each client.",

Their favourable outcomes in terms of efficacy and side-effect profile can be thwarted by the development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Cutaneous irAEs are relatively common in patients undergoing immunotherapy and include common inflammatory dermatoses (e.g. eczematous, psoriasiform and lichenoid phenotypes), maculopapular eruptions, pruritus and immunobullous disorders. Most of these reactions can be managed without ICIs having to be stopped completely; however, there are some life-threatening toxicities that dermatologists and oncologists should be aware of. In this review, we focus on how to recognize the commonly associated cutaneous irAEs, touching upon rarer reactions and red flags; finally, we provide guidance on their management.",

      "abstract": "Rosacea is a common skin disease that affects about 5% of the general population. Its symptoms include telangiectasia, persistent erythema, burning/stinging sensation, dry skin sensation, and pruritus. It is characterized by a chronic course with frequent exacerbation. It often coexists with anxiety and depression, reducing the quality of life of affected patients. The etiopathogenesis of rosacea is complex and not fully elucidated; hence, there is no causative effective treatment. In this review, we highlight the role of a cosmetologist in the treatment of rosacea and the maintenance of remission. As part of medical treatment, patients are advised to introduce lifestyle changes and use proper skin care; a cosmetologist can help educate patients affected with rosacea, create effective home care programs for skin care, and support them with treatments in beauty salons. Proper skin care is essential, including the use of dermocosmetics, cleansing of the skin, and frequent visits to beauty salons for tailored apparatus procedures. A cosmetologist is more accessible to patients and can help implement healthy daily habits, including skin care and eating habits, as well as support and mediate good communication between the patient and the patient's treating physician, thereby improving compliance and ensuring long-term satisfactory outcomes.",

To address this, a novel technique called NanoGlow has been introduced for encapsulating peptide-based cosmetic raw materials into engineered nanosized plant-derived exosomes (pExo) to achieve the goal of a healthier and more radiant skin state. In this approach, pExo served as carriers for cosmetic peptides across the intact skin barrier, enhancing their biological effectiveness in skin beauty. The NanoGlow strategy combines chemical activation and physical proencapsulation, boasting a high success rate and straightforward and stable operation, making it suitable for large-scale production.

      "abstract": "Given the central importance of the \"eyes,\" meaning the periorbital region, to facial appearance, the motivated blepharoplasty patient has the opportunity to improve appearance significantly beyond the minimum of age reversal, to reveal inner beauty or add attractiveness. Bright and beautiful eyes have good three-dimensional contouring. The benefits of a quality eyelid crease enable the surgical focus to be on lid contouring with a reduced requirement for lid skin and fat excision. A durable crease maintains fixation of both the tarsal and infrabrow segments. The softness of youthful eyes can be regained by precise, but cautious, use of lipofilling.",

Neurocosmetics, a frontier at the intersection of neuroscience, dermatology, and psychodermatology, aims to target this skin-brain axis to enhance not only skin health but also emotional well being. This commentary explores the underlying neurocutaneous and neuroimmune mechanisms, the emerging role of the skin microbiome in emotion-linked skin responses, and how artificial intelligence technologies can help personalize these strategies. The convergence of neuroscience and dermatology may pave the way for a new generation of evidence-based skincare with psychophysiological impact, a transformative concept in clinical and cosmetic practice.",

      "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins confer biomechanical properties, maintain cell phenotype and mediate tissue repair (via release of sequestered cytokines and proteases). In contrast to intracellular proteomes, where proteins are monitored and replaced over short time periods, many ECM proteins function for years (decades in humans) without replacement. The longevity of abundant ECM proteins, such as collagen I and elastin, leaves them vulnerable to damage accumulation and their host organs prone to chronic, age-related diseases. However, ECM protein fragmentation can potentially produce peptide cytokines (matrikines) which may exacerbate and/or ameliorate age- and disease-related ECM remodelling. In this review, we discuss ECM composition, function and degradation and highlight examples of endogenous matrikines. We then critically and comprehensively analyse published studies of matrix-derived peptides used as topical skin treatments, before considering the potential for improvements in the discovery and delivery of novel matrix-derived peptides to skin and internal organs. From this, we conclude that while the translational impact of matrix-derived peptide therapeutics is evident, the mechanisms of action of these peptides are poorly defined. Further, well-designed, multimodal studies are required.",

Recently, tattooing of the nipple and areola of the breast has been introduced as a corrective treatment of sequelae from breast cancer surgery and radiotherapy. The psychologic impact of a disfigured nipple and areola can invalidate self-esteem of the sufferer lifelong with major consequences for social life. Medical tattooing can often restore the visual appearance of the nipple-areolar complex back to normality and even improve the 3D impression of the entire breast. High skills of the operator are needed. The article reviews the theoretical background, patient selection and information, technical performance, and aftercare. Close cooperation between surgeon, dermatologist, and medical tattooist is essential. Medical centers treating breast cancer should routinely have access to corrective medical tattooing.",

Irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) due to chronic mild trauma (frictional dermatitis), contact with soaps, detergents, and wet work is frequent in beauty operators. Para-phenylenediamine (PPD), acrylates, essential oils, fragrances, colophony, and preservatives are most frequently responsible for allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in these professional categories. Young women are mainly affected, with the most affected sites being the hands. Anamnesis, patch tests with the baseline, integrative series, and use products are important to understand possible sensitization. To reduce the risk, prevention is important, and workers should be adequately trained in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).",

      "title": "The Intestinal and Skin Microbiome in Patients with Atopic Dermatitis and Their Influence on the Course of the Disease: A Literature Review.",
      "abstract": "Bacteria inhabiting the digestive tract are responsible for our health. The microbiome is essential for the development of the immune system and homeostasis of the body. Maintaining homeostasis is very important, but also extremely complicated. The gut microbiome is related to the skin microbiome. It can therefore be assumed that changes in the microbes inhabiting the skin are greatly influenced by the bacteria living in the intestines. Changes in the composition and function of microbes (dysbiosis in the skin and intestines) have recently been linked to changes in the immune response and the development of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis (AD). This review was compiled by collaborating Dermatologists specializing in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. A comprehensive review of the current literature was performed using PubMed and limited to relevant case reports and original papers on the skin microbiome in atopic dermatitis. The inclusion criterion was that the paper was published in a peer-reviewed journal in the last 10 years (2012-2022). No limitations on the language of the publication or the type of study were made. It has been shown that any rapid changes in the composition of the microflora may be associated with the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. Various studies have proven that the microbiome of many systems (including the intestines) may have a significant impact on the development of the inflammatory process within the skin in the course of AD. It has been shown that an early interaction between the microbiome and immune system may result in a noticeable delay in the onset of atopic diseases. It seems to be of high importance for physicians to understand the role of the microbiome in AD, not only from the pathophysiological standpoint but also in terms of the complex treatment that is required. Perhaps young children diagnosed with AD present specific characteristics of the intestinal microflora. This might be related to the early introduction of antibiotics and dietary manipulations in breastfeeding mothers in the early childhood of AD patients. It is most likely related to the abuse of antibiotics from the first days of life.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with skin of color (SOC) can sunburn and develop skin cancer, often presenting at advanced stages with higher morbidity and melanoma-related mortality. However, patient education on photoprotection for SOC populations remains limited. This scoping review investigated the benefits of photoprotection and the factors influencing sun protective behaviors in SOC populations. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed were searched from January 1st, 2018 to December 31st, 2022, using the overarching terms of \"SOC,\" \"skin cancer,\" and \"photoprotection.\" Original, English-language studies were included, while non-human and incomplete studies were excluded. The review found that while photoprotection benefits SOC populations, individuals within these groups exhibit lower knowledge of and participation in sun-protective behaviors. This gap is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including cultural values, family dynamics, gender, education, and societal norms surrounding beauty. Misconceptions about innate sun protection contribute to this gap. To address this, culturally relevant education, community engagement, healthcare integration, and increased representation of SOC in dermatological research are essential to improving sun-safe habits in these communities.",

      "abstract": "Grape stems have emerged as a promising natural ingredient in the cosmetics industry due to their abundance of phenolic compounds, known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These compounds have shown great potential in promoting skin health, fighting signs of aging, and shielding against environmental stressors. With high concentrations of resveratrol, flavonoids, and tannins, grape stems have garnered attention from cosmetic scientists. Research has indicated that phenolic compounds extracted from grape stems possess potent antioxidant abilities, effectively combating free radicals that accelerate aging. Moreover, these compounds have demonstrated the capacity to shield the skin from UV damage, boost collagen production, and enhance skin elasticity. Cosmetic formulations incorporating grape stem extracts have displayed promising results in addressing various skin concerns, including reducing wrinkles, fine lines, and age spots, leading to a more youthful appearance. Additionally, grape stem extracts have exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, soothing irritated skin and diminishing redness. Exploring the potential of grape stem phenolic compounds for cosmetics paves the way for sustainable and natural beauty products. By harnessing the beauty benefits of grape stems, the cosmetics industry can provide effective and eco-friendly solutions for consumers seeking natural alternatives. Ongoing research holds the promise of innovative grape stem-based formulations that could revolutionize the cosmetics market, fully unlocking the potential of these extraordinary botanical treasures.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70 years (95% women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90 days is effective in reducing skin aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.",

      "abstract": "The skin is a sentinel organ making easily visible the passing of time. Chronological and environmental aging weakens skin structure and functions. The skin barrier, the elastic and mechanical properties of the cutaneous tissue as well as its vascular reactivity are impacted by aging. The barrier dysfunction in aged skin is caused by defects in epidermal keratinocytes renewal and differentiation notably linked to abnormal expression of microRNAs regulating cell death and autophagy. An abnormal balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins modifies the mechanical properties of the dermis in aged skin. Finally, a reduction of the vascular reactivity linked to endothelial dysfunctions is observed in elderly people. These biological processes can be targeted by therapeutic approaches either topical or systemic, especially using anti-oxydants or senolytics. These anti-aging strategies might contribute to restore, at least in part, the functional integrity of aged skin.",

Different kinds of environmental stressors, for example, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), temperature, air pollutants, smoking, and diet, accelerate skin aging by stimulating inflammatory molecules. Skin aging caused by UVR is characterized by loss of elasticity, fine lines, wrinkles, reduced epidermal and dermal components, increased epidermal permeability, delayed wound healing, and approximately 90% of skin aging. These external factors can cause aging through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated inflammation, as well as aged skin is a source of circulatory inflammatory molecules which accelerate skin aging and cause aging-related diseases.

      "abstract": "Skin aging has long been considered a purely cosmetic problem. However, as life expectancy increases, skin aging is taking on a functional dimension that goes beyond cosmetics and appearance. Preventive or therapeutic strategies are needed to target cellular senescence, a key process underlying the alterations in skin function and appearance that occur with aging, as well as to address the age-related skin changes associated with 'dermatoporosis' and chronic skin insufficiency/fragility syndrome. Thus, given the need for effective anti-aging products that improve both the appearance and function of the skin, it is essential to distinguish active ingredients that have been proven to be effective, among the large number of available over-the-counter cosmeceuticals. This brief review focuses on a core group of topical actives, describing their clinical effects on senescence and aging, and their molecular mechanisms of action. These actives include hyaluronic acid, which has hydrating and viscoelastic properties and has been shown to reduce skin atrophy; retinaldehyde, which activates retinoid receptors and increases cutaneous elasticity; vitamins C and E, which provide stable oxidative protection; and niacinamide, which reduces inflammation and mitigates the effects of senescence.",

      "title": "A Mixture of Topical Forms of Polydeoxyribonucleotide, Vitamin C, and Niacinamide Attenuated Skin Pigmentation and Increased Skin Elasticity by Modulating Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-like 2.",
      "abstract": "It is well-known that increased oxidative stress caused by ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation induces melanogenesis and activates metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade collagen and elastin fibers, leading to decreased skin elasticity. Various antioxidant agents, such as vitamin C and niacinamide, have been evaluated for use as treatments for photoaging or skin pigmentation. In this study, we evaluated the ability of a topical liquid formula of polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN), vitamin C, and niacinamide (PVN) delivered via a microneedling therapy system (MTS) to attenuate photoaging and pigmentation by increasing nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NRF2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and decreasing MMP expression in a UV-B-radiated animal model. The effects of the PVN were compared with those of individual PDRN and hydroquinone (HQ) compounds. The expression of NRF2/HO-1 significantly increased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN in UV-B-radiated animal skin. The activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen oxidase decreased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN, and the superoxide dismutase activity increased. The expression of tumor protein p53 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase activity decreased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN, and this decrease was accompanied by decreased melanin content in the skin. The expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells and MMP2/3/9 decreased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN in UV-B-radiated skin. However, the expression of collagen type I α1 chain and the amount of collagen fibers that were evaluated by Masson's trichrome staining increased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN. The contents of elastin fibers, fibrillin 1/2 and fibulin 5 increased in response to HQ, PDRN, and PVN. In conclusion, PVN delivered via MTS led to decreased melanogenesis and destruction of collagen and elastin fibers by MMPs, and, thus, PVN decreased skin pigmentation and increased skin elasticity.",

      "abstract": "Wounds have always been the point of concern owing to the involvement of infections and the level of severity. Therefore, the management of wounds always requires additional effort for comprehensive healing and subsequent removal of the scar from the wound site. The role of biomaterials in the management of chronic wounds has been well established. One of such biomaterials is collagen (Col) that is considered to be the crucial component of most of the formulations being developed for wound healing. The role of Col extracted from marine invertebrates remains an unmarked origin of the proteinaceous constituent in the evolution of innovative pharmaceuticals. Col is a promising, immiscible, fibrous amino acid of indigenous origin that is ubiquitously present in extracellular matrices and connective tissues. There are different types of Col present in the body such as type I, II, III, IV, and V however the natural sources of Col are vegetables and marine animals. Its physical properties like high tensile strength, adherence nature, elasticity, and remodeling contribute significantly in the wound healing process. Col containing formulations such as hydrogels, sponges, creams, peptides, and composite nanofibers have been utilized widely in wound healing and tissue engineering purposes truly as the first line of defense. Here we present the recent advancements in Col based dosage forms for wound healing. The Col based market of topical preparations and the published reports identify Colas a useful biomaterial for the delivery of pharmaceuticals and a platform for tissue engineering.",

      "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is present in all connective tissues and organs, including the skin and joint fluid. However, few clinical trials have comprehensively evaluated the impacts of oral HA on skin conditions, including wrinkles and moisturization. In this study, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial of daily HA (120 mg) intake for 12 weeks in 40 healthy Asian men and women (aged 35-64 years). Skin condition was determined by the evaluation of wrinkles, stratum corneum water content, the amount of transepidermal water loss, elasticity, and through image analysis. After 12 weeks, skin condition was significantly improved in terms of wrinkle assessment, stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss, and elasticity in the HA group compared to the placebo group. Regarding the percentage change from baseline, wrinkle assessment, stratum corneum water content, and skin elasticity were significantly improved in the HA group versus the placebo group after 8 and 12 weeks of ingestion. The present findings indicate that oral ingestion of HA may suppress wrinkles and improve skin condition.",

      "abstract": "Scleromyxedema or generalized diffuse lichen myxoedematosus is a rare mucinosis that is associated with monoclonal gammopathy and which frequently affects multiple extracutaneous organ systems. The pathogenesis of scleromyxedema has not been fully elucidated, but includes stimulation of glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The clinical course of scleromyxedema is chronic and often progressive, leading to severe morbidity and even death. The characteristic skin findings encompass multiple waxy papules often on indurated plaques, while thickening of skin leads to conspicuous folds on glabella and dorsal aspects of finger joints. Microscopical manifestations are dermal deposits of glycosaminoglycans between collagen bundles in reticular dermis, increased numbers of fibroblasts and fibrosis as well as loss of elastic fibers. Progressive skin involvement results in decreased mobility of the mouth and joints and even contractures. Extracutaneous manifestations occur in the musculoskeletal or cardiovascular system, in the gastrointestinal or respiratory tract, in the kidneys or in the central and peripheral nervous system. There are no in-label or evidence-based treatments available for scleromyxedema, but by expert consensus high-dose immunoglobulins are considered as treatment of choice, followed in case of insufficient efficacy by systemic glucocorticosteroids and then lenalidomide or thalidomide. In severe and refractory cases, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been performed. Long-term maintenance treatment is usually required to prevent recurrences. Close interdisciplinary follow-up is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging has been associated with the onset of various skin issues, and recent studies have identified an increase in Cdc42 activity in naturally aging mice. While previous literature has suggested that CASIN, a specific inhibitor of Cdc42 activity, may possess anti-aging properties, its specific effects on the epidermis and dermis, as well as the underlying mechanisms in naturally aging mice, remain unclear. Our study revealed that CASIN demonstrated the ability to increase epidermal and dermal thickness, enhance dermal-epidermal junction, and stimulate collagen and elastic fiber synthesis in 9-, 15-, and 24-month-old C57BL/6 mice in vivo. Moreover, CASIN was found to enhance the proliferation, differentiation, and colony formation and restore the cytoskeletal morphology of primary keratinocytes in naturally aging skin in vitro. Furthermore, the anti-aging properties of CASIN on primary fibroblasts in aging mice were mediated by the ribosomal protein RPL4 using proteomic sequencing, influencing collagen synthesis and cytoskeletal morphology both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, both subcutaneous injection and topical application exhibited anti-aging effects for a duration of 21 days. Additionally, CASIN exhibited anti-inflammatory properties, while reduced expression of RPL4 was associated with increased inflammation in the skin of naturally aging mice. Taken together, our results unveil a novel function of RPL4 in skin aging, providing a foundational basis for future investigations into ribosomal proteins. And CASIN shows promise as a potential anti-aging agent for naturally aging mouse skin, suggesting potential applications in the field.",

      "abstract": "This paper reviews the advances made in recent years on modeling approaches and experimental techniques to characterize the mechanical properties of human skin. The skin is the largest organ of the human body that has a complex multi-layered structure with different mechanical behaviors. The mechanical properties of human skin play an important role in distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy skin. Furthermore, knowing these mechanical properties enables computer simulation, skin research, clinical studies, as well as diagnosis and treatment monitoring of skin diseases. This paper reviews the recent efforts on modeling skin using linear, nonlinear, viscoelastic, and anisotropic materials. The work also focuses on aging effects, microstructure analysis, and non-invasive methods for skin testing. A detailed explanation of the skin structure and numerical models, such as finite element models, are discussed in this work. This work also compares different experimental methods that measure the mechanical properties of human skin. The work reviews the experimental results in the literature and shows how the mechanical properties of human skin vary with the skin sites, the layers, and the structure of human skin. The paper also discusses how state-of-the-art technology can advance skin research.",

Epidermal biomarkers can aid in evaluating the functionality of the skin barrier and understanding the mechanisms that underlay its impairment. This narrative review provides an overview of recent studies on epidermal biomarkers associated with the function and integrity of the skin barrier, and their application in research on atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis. The reviewed studies encompass a wide spectrum of molecular, morphological and biophysical biomarkers, mainly obtained from stratum corneum tape strips and biopsies. Lipids, natural moisturizing factors, and structural proteins are the most frequently reported molecular biomarkers. Additionally, corneocyte surface topography and elasticity show potential as biomarkers for assessing the physical barrier of the skin. In contact dermatitis studies, biomarkers are commonly employed to evaluate skin irritation and differentiate between irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. In atopic dermatitis, biomarkers are primarily utilized to identify differences between atopic and healthy skin, for predictive purposes, and monitoring response to therapies. While this overview identifies potential biomarkers for the skin barrier, their validation as epidermal biomarkers for atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis has yet to be established.",

According to the level of maturity of the lesions, SG is divided into striae rubra (SR) and striae alba (SA). The pathogenesis remains unclear; recent studies have implicated abnormalities in elastic fibers, collagen fibrils, and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Changes in the expression of hormone receptors and hormone levels have also been hypothesized. Considering this new information, we reviewed successful treatments of SG and listed them in two tables. Our review found that topical treatments were relatively weak compared with laser and light treatment, with which the appearance of SR and SA can be significantly improved. Lasers combined with other modalities, such as additional energy devices and topical agents, were also proven effective, but more large-scale trials are necessary.",

      "abstract": "Gradually, loss of skin elasticity and elastic properties occurs after 30 years of age and will be associated with several changes, including creating wrinkles, skin laxity (sagging skin), and skin blemishes. In general, people all over the world are looking for ways to keep their facial skin young over time. There are several strategies to skin rejuvenate, including invasive and non-invasive methods. However, invasive methods have less popularity than non-invasive methods due to their need for specialist physicians (medical expertise), localized neuropathic pains for patients, the prevalence and incidence of skin infections, and high-cost clinical services. In the meantime, skin hydration is one of the simplest non-invasive methods for skin rejuvenation, and HA, with anti-aging and skin collagen-stimulating properties, has been introduced as a natural skin moisturizing agent. Therefore, since this composition maintains facial skin moisture and radiance, and improves its elasticity, it has always been considered by experts and specialist physicians. On the other hand, due to its lipophilic properties, hydrophilic macromolecules containing HA cannot pass through the stratum corneum. However, they have temporary and superficial softening effects on the skin. Hence, some nanocarriers have been suggested to overcome this problem and develop the properties and positive influences of HA on skin rejuvenation. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce some new non-invasive approaches in facial skin rejuvenation, including applying liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, and ionic liquids, to transport HA into the inner and deeper layers of the skin, including Dermis. In this review article, we examine non-invasive methods using nanoparticles to deliver HA to the epidermis and dermis of the skin for skin rejuvenation.",

      "abstract": "Whatever the exposure route, chemical, physical and biological pollutants modify the whole organism response, leading to nerve, cardiac, respiratory, reproductive, and skin system pathologies. Skin acts as a barrier for preventing pollutant modifications. This review aims to present the available scientific models, which help investigate the impact of pollution on the skin. The research question was \"Which experimental models illustrate the impact of pollution on the skin in humans?\" The review covered a period of 10 years following a PECO statement on in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo and in silico models. Of 582 retrieved articles, 118 articles were eligible. In oral and inhalation routes, dermal exposure had an important impact at both local and systemic levels. Healthy skin models included primary cells, cell lines, co-cultures, reconstructed human epidermis, and skin explants. In silico models estimated skin exposure and permeability. All pollutants affected the skin by altering elasticity, thickness, the structure of epidermal barrier strength, and dermal extracellular integrity. Some specific models concerned wound healing or the skin aging process. Underlying mechanisms were an exacerbated inflammatory skin reaction with the modulation of several cytokines and oxidative stress responses, ending with apoptosis. Pathological skin models revealed the consequences of environmental pollutants on psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and tumour development. Finally, scientific models were used for evaluating the safety and efficacy of potential skin formulations in preventing the skin aging process or skin irritation after repeated contact. The review gives an overview of scientific skin models used to assess the effects of pollutants. Chemical and physical pollutants were mainly represented while biological contaminants were little studied. In future developments, cell hypoxia and microbiota models may be considered as more representative of clinical situations. Models considering humidity and temperature variations may reflect the impact of these changes.",

      "title": "The cellular mechanobiology of aging: from biology to mechanics.",
      "abstract": "Aging is a chronic, complicated process that leads to degenerative physical and biological changes in living organisms. Aging is associated with permanent, gradual physiological cellular decay that affects all aspects of cellular mechanobiological features, including cellular cytoskeleton structures, mechanosensitive signaling pathways, and forces in the cell, as well as the cell's ability to sense and adapt to extracellular biomechanical signals in the tissue environment through mechanotransduction. These mechanobiological changes in cells are directly or indirectly responsible for dysfunctions and diseases in various organ systems, including the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, skin, and immune systems. This review critically examines the role of aging in the progressive decline of the mechanobiology occurring in cells, and establishes mechanistic frameworks to understand the mechanobiological effects of aging on disease progression and to develop new strategies for halting and reversing the aging process. Our review also highlights the recent development of novel bioengineering approaches for studying the key mechanobiological mechanisms in aging.",

      "abstract": "Skin ageing is a complex physiological process primarily characterised by the deepening of wrinkles and the sagging of the skin. Collagen is essential for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness. As skin ages, it experiences structural and functional changes in collagen, including a decrease in collagen synthesis and an increase in collagen hydrolysis. Thus, promoting collagen synthesis represents a practical strategy for mitigating skin ageing. This review systematically described the functions, classifications and biosynthesis process of collagen, as well as its role in skin ageing. Additionally, the major signalling pathways and targets associated with collagen synthesis were also discussed. More importantly, the review provided a detailed summary of natural products with collagen synthesis-promoting effects and highlighted small molecule compounds with potential anti-ageing activity, especially PPARδ agonists. The relevant content offers potential targets and lead compounds for the development of anti-skin ageing therapies.",

      "abstract": "Collagen and hyaluronic acid are essential components of the dermis that collaborate to maintain skin elasticity and hydration due to their unique biochemical properties and interactions within the extracellular matrix. Prolonged exposure to glucocorticoids can induce skin aging, which manifests as diminished collagen content and hyaluronic acid levels in the dermis. Nerol, a monoterpene alcohol found in essential oils, was examined in this study for its potential to counteract glucocorticoid-induced skin aging and the underlying mechanism behind its effects. Our findings reveal that non-toxic concentrations of nerol treatment can reinstate collagen content and hyaluronic acid levels in human dermal fibroblasts treated with dexamethasone. Mechanistically, nerol mitigates dexamethasone-induced oxidative stress by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway. The protective effects of nerol were significantly abrogated when the Nrf2 pathway was inhibited using the specific inhibitor ML385. In conclusion, nerol protects human dermal fibroblasts against glucocorticoid-induced skin aging by ameliorating oxidative stress via activation of the Nrf2 pathway, thereby highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing and treating glucocorticoid-induced skin aging.",

Further, CMC and modified CMC could be engineered to fabricate scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. In recent times, CMC and its derivatives have been developed as smart bioinks for 3D bioprinting applications. From these perspectives, the applications of CMC in tissue engineering and current knowledge on peculiar features of CMC in 3D and 4D bioprinting applications are elaborated in detail. Lastly, future perspectives of CMC for wider applications in tissue engineering and 3D/4D bioprinting are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "The self-healing properties and ionic sensing capabilities of the human skin offer inspiring groundwork for the designs of stretchable iontronic skins. However, from electronic to ionic mechanosensitive skins, simultaneously achieving autonomously superior self-healing properties, superior elasticity, and effective control of ion dynamics in a homogeneous system is rarely feasible. Here, we report a Cl-functionalized iontronic pressure sensitive material (CLiPS), designed via the introduction of Cl-functionalized groups into a polyurethane matrix, which realizes an ultrafast, autonomous self-healing speed (4.3 µm/min), high self-healing efficiency (91% within 60 min), and mechanosensitive piezo-ionic dynamics. This strategy promotes both an excellent elastic recovery (100%) and effective control of ion dynamics because the Cl groups trap the ions in the system via ion-dipole interactions, resulting in excellent pressure sensitivity (7.36 kPa",

      "abstract": "The viscoelastic properties of cells are responsible for the adhesion process to different surfaces and for cell motility. Therefore, it is very important to develop specific, label-free biosensors with the use of whole cells to study the effect of various factors on the survival and properties of selected type of normal and pathological cells. The quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation energy monitoring (QCM-D) is a technique which enables to track these changes in cells during real-time experiments. One of the applied procedures of the evaluation of the cells' viscoelastic changes is based on the investigations of interactions between specific, different glycans, present on the surface of the primary tumor and its metastases with specific lectins. Two procedures have been developed to detect the differences in the cellular glycosylation profile using cell-based sensors (adherent cells cultured on sensors) and suspension cell-based sensors (adherent cells mechanically detached and inserted into the QCM-D chamber with a sensor). Furthermore, in this work some cell-based sensor regeneration protocols have been described and a lectin-ELISA assay with a fluorescently labeled lectin, thus enabling a qualitative and quantitative tracking of each step of the lectin-glycan binding and unbinding process performed on whole cells.",

It occurs because the elasticity and resilience of the skin results in it deforming and moving rather than sustaining injuries from being tethered and relatively immobile. Given the known increase in skin and soft-tissue fragility in the elderly with a greater vulnerability for bruising and skin tears, a study was undertaken to determine whether Casper's sign may be present or not in older populations. A review of autopsy files at Forensic Science SA over a 20-year period from January 2000 to December 2019 was performed in individuals ≥80 years of age where death involved blunt chest trauma, blunt abdominal trauma or multiple blunt-force injuries. Four cases were identified. All of the decedents were males aged 82-89 years (",

Transgenic and recombinant technologies offer great promise for the scaled-up production of new silkworm- and spider-silk-inspired fibres. However, despite considerable effort, producing an artificial silk that recaptures the physico-chemical properties of naturally spun silk has thus far proven elusive. The mechanical, biochemical, and other properties of pre-and post-development fibres accordingly should be determined across scales and structural hierarchies whenever feasible. We have herein reviewed and made recommendations on some of those practices for measuring the bulk fibre properties; skin-core structures; and the primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of silk proteins and the properties of dopes and their proteins. We thereupon examine emerging methodologies and make assessments on how they might be utilized to realize the goal of developing high quality bio-inspired fibres.",

      "abstract": "Couplants play significant roles in ultrasonography. To ensure imaging quality, it is critical to maintain conformal contact of the couplant with both the skin surface and the ultrasound probe in clinical applications. In addition, either the probe or the couplant should not deform the skin surface significantly, which will result in an overestimated modulus of the tissue for elastography imaging. However, existing liquid gel couplants cannot bear external compressive force, while existing solid gel couplants cannot maintain a conformal contact with skin surface. Especially, the nonconformal contacts and deformation become more severe on body parts of locally high curvatures such as skin tumors, fingers, and elbows. Here we report a bilayer design of couplant for ultrasonography, composing of a stiff layer and a compliant layer of hydrogels. The bilayer hydrogel pad enables it to bear external compression, allowing the probe to move smoothly, conforming high curvature parts and releasing stress concentration. Our clinical experiments further show high quality imaging of thyroid nodules, skin tumors in elbows and fingers using the bilayer hydrogel pad, which represents a promising alternative for a range of applications in ultrasonic diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Proper subcellular localization is crucial for the functioning of biomacromolecules, including proteins and RNAs. Nuclear transport is a fundamental cellular process that regulates the localization of many macromolecules within the nuclear or cytoplasmic compartments. In humans, approximately 60 proteins are involved in nuclear transport, including nucleoporins that form membrane-embedded nuclear pore complexes, karyopherins that transport cargoes through these complexes, and Ran system proteins that ensure directed and rapid transport. Many of these nuclear transport proteins play additional and essential roles in mitosis, biomolecular condensation, and gene transcription. Dysregulation of nuclear transport is linked to major human diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infections. Selinexor (KPT-330), an inhibitor targeting the nuclear export factor XPO1 (also known as CRM1), was approved in 2019 to treat two types of blood cancers, and dozens of clinical trials of are ongoing. This review summarizes approximately three decades of research data in this field but focuses on the structure and function of individual nuclear transport proteins from recent studies, providing a cutting-edge and holistic view on the role of nuclear transport proteins in health and disease. In-depth knowledge of this rapidly evolving field has the potential to bring new insights into fundamental biology, pathogenic mechanisms, and therapeutic approaches.",

Pyroptosis triggers the release of inflammatory molecules, including damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). However, the consequences of pyroptosis-especially beyond interleukin (IL)-1 cytokines and DAMPs-that govern inflammation are poorly defined. Here, we show intercellular propagation of pyroptosis from dying cells to bystander cells in vitro and in vivo. We identified extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by pyroptotic cells as the propagator of lytic death to naive cells, promoting inflammation. DNA-PAINT super-resolution and immunoelectron microscopy revealed GSDMD pore structures on EVs released by pyroptotic cells. Importantly, pyroptotic EVs transplant GSDMD pores on the plasma membrane of bystander cells and kill them. Overall, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell vesicular transplantation of GSDMD pores disseminates pyroptosis, revealing a domino-like effect governing disease-associated bystander cell death.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) is a phenomenon that abruptly causes the flux of low molecular weight solutes (molecular weight up to 1,500) across the generally impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane. The mPT is mediated by the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a supramolecular entity assembled at the interface of the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. In contrast to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which mostly activates apoptosis, mPT can trigger different cellular responses, from the physiological regulation of mitophagy to the activation of apoptosis or necrosis. Although there are several molecular candidates for the mPTP, its molecular nature remains contentious. This lack of molecular data was a significant setback that prevented mechanistic insight into the mPTP, pharmacological targeting and the generation of informative animal models.

      "abstract": "Osteochondral injury is a prevalent condition for which no specific treatment is currently available. This study presents a piezoelectric-conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage-decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and piezoelectric-conductive modified gelatin (Gel-PC). The piezoelectricity of the scaffold is achieved through the modification of diphenylalanine (FF) assembly on the pore surface, while the conductive properties of scaffold are achieved by the incorporating poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). In vitro experiments demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) undergo biphasic division during differentiation. In vivo studies using a Parma pig model of osteochondral defects demonstrate that the piezoelectric-conductive scaffold exhibits superior reparative efficacy. Notably, the generation of electrical stimulation is linked to joint movement. During joint activity, mechanical forces compress the scaffold, leading to deformation and the subsequent generation of an electric potential difference. The positive charges accumulated on the upper layer of the scaffold attract BMSCs, promoting their migration to the upper layer and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the negative charges in the lower layer induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Overall, this piezoelectric-conducive scaffold provides a promising platform for the effective repair of osteochondral defects.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is a hyper-heterogeneous syndrome in which the systemic inflammatory response persists throughout the course of the disease and the inflammatory and immune responses are dynamically altered at different pathogenic stages. Gasdermins (GSDMs) proteins are pore-forming executors in the membrane, subsequently mediating the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and inflammatory cell death. With the increasing research on GSDMs proteins and sepsis, it is believed that GSDMs protein are one of the most promising therapeutic targets in sepsis in the future. A more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the functions of GSDMs proteins in sepsis is important to alleviate the multi-organ dysfunction and reduce sepsis-induced mortality. In this review, we focus on the function of GSDMs proteins, the molecular mechanism of GSDMs involved in sepsis, and the regulatory mechanism of GSDMs-mediated signaling pathways, aiming to provide novel ideas and therapeutic strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.",

      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine carcinomas, such as neuroendocrine prostate cancer and small-cell lung cancer, commonly have a poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. We report that ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), a deubiquitinating enzyme, is elevated in tissues and plasma from patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas. Loss of UCHL1 decreases tumor growth and inhibits metastasis of these malignancies. UCHL1 maintains neuroendocrine differentiation and promotes cancer progression by regulating nucleoporin, POM121, and p53. UCHL1 binds, deubiquitinates, and stabilizes POM121 to regulate POM121-associated nuclear transport of E2F1 and c-MYC. Treatment with the UCHL1 inhibitor LDN-57444 slows tumor growth and metastasis across neuroendocrine carcinomas. The combination of UCHL1 inhibitors with cisplatin, the standard of care used for neuroendocrine carcinomas, significantly delays tumor growth in pre-clinical settings. Our study reveals mechanisms of UCHL1 function in regulating the progression of neuroendocrine carcinomas and identifies UCHL1 as a therapeutic target and potential molecular indicator for diagnosing and monitoring treatment responses in these malignancies.",

      "abstract": "Intestinal epithelial expression of the tight junction protein claudin-2, which forms paracellular cation and water channels, is precisely regulated during development and in disease. Here, we show that small intestinal epithelial claudin-2 expression is selectively upregulated in septic patients. Similar changes occurred in septic mice, where claudin-2 upregulation coincided with increased flux across the paracellular pore pathway. In order to define the significance of these changes, sepsis was induced in claudin-2 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. Sepsis-induced increases in pore pathway permeability were prevented by claudin-2 KO. Moreover, claudin-2 deletion reduced interleukin-17 production and T cell activation and limited intestinal damage. These effects were associated with reduced numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and bacteria within the peritoneal fluid of septic claudin-2 KO mice. Most strikingly, claudin-2 deletion dramatically enhanced survival in sepsis. Finally, the microbial changes induced by sepsis were less pathogenic in claudin-2 KO mice as survival of healthy WT mice injected with cecal slurry collected from WT mice 24 h after sepsis was far worse than that of healthy WT mice injected with cecal slurry collected from claudin-2 KO mice 24 h after sepsis. Claudin-2 upregulation and increased pore pathway permeability are, therefore, key intermediates that contribute to development of dysbiosis, intestinal damage, inflammation, ineffective pathogen control, and increased mortality in sepsis. The striking impact of claudin-2 deletion on progression of the lethal cascade activated during sepsis suggests that claudin-2 may be an attractive therapeutic target in septic patients.",

      "abstract": "Interleukin-33 (IL-33), an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that responds rapidly to environmental insult, has a critical role in initiating airway inflammatory diseases. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IL-33 secretion following allergen exposure is not clear. Here, we found that two cell events were fundamental for IL-33 secretion after exposure to allergens. First, stress granule assembly activated by allergens licensed the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of IL-33, but not the secretion of IL-33. Second, a neo-form murine amino-terminal p40 fragment gasdermin D (Gsdmd), whose generation was independent of inflammatory caspase-1 and caspase-11, dominated cytosolic secretion of IL-33 by forming pores in the cell membrane. Either the blockade of stress granule assembly or the abolishment of p40 production through amino acid mutation of residues 309-313 (ELRQQ) could efficiently prevent the release of IL-33 in murine epithelial cells. Our findings indicated that targeting stress granule disassembly and Gsdmd fragmentation could reduce IL-33-dependent allergic airway inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury (ALI)/ acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is featured by intensive inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, which lead to cytokine storms and pyroptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate whether melatonin was capable of alleviating LPS-induced ALI via activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/heme oxygenase 1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling axis and inhibiting pyroptosis. Mice were injected with melatonin (30 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for consecutive five days before LPS instillation intratracheally, and human alveolar epithelial cell (AECⅡ) A549 cell lines and murine macrophages Raw264.7 cell lines were pretreated with melatonin (400 μM) before LPS (10 μg/ml) stimulation. The result demonstrated that LPS induced obvious lung injury characterized by alveolar damage, neutrophil infiltration and lung edema as well as the reduction of the survival rate of mice, which were totally reversed by melatonin pretreatment. Mechanistically, melatonin pretreatment activated nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor (Nrf) 2 signaling, subsequently, drove antioxidant pathways including significant increases in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1, Mn-SOD and Catalase in vivo and in vitro. Simultaneously, melatonin inhibited ROS and MDA overproduction, iNOS expression as well as TNF-α and IL-1β expression and release. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited LPS-induced pyroptosis by reversing the overexpression of NLRP3, Caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-18 and GSDMD-N, as well as LDH release and TUNEL-positive cells in A549 cells and Raw264.7 cells. Overall, the current study suggests that melatonin exerts protective roles on LPS-induced ALI and pyroptosis by inhibiting NLRP3-GSDMD pathway via activating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis.",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis, a typical inflammatory cell death mode, has been increasingly demonstrated to have therapeutic value in inflammatory diseases such as sepsis. However, the mechanisms and therapeutic targets of sepsis remain elusive. Here, we reported that REGγ inhibition promoted pyroptosis by regulating members of the gasdermin family in macrophages. Mechanistically, REGγ directly degraded Bim, a factor of the Bcl-2 family that can inhibit the cleavage of GSDMD/E, ultimately preventing the occurrence of pyroptosis. Furthermore, cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis model mice showed downregulation of REGγ at both the RNA and protein levels. Gasdermin-mediated pyroptosis was augmented in REGγ-knockout mice, and these mice exhibited more severe sepsis-related tissue injury. More importantly, we found that REGγ expression was downregulated in clinical sepsis samples, such as those from patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection. Finally, PA-infected mice showed decreased REGγ levels in the lung. In summary, our study reveals that the REGγ-Bim-GSDMD/E pathway is a novel regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in sepsis-related tissue injury.",

      "abstract": "Acute lung injury, referred to as the acute chest syndrome, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), which often occurs in the setting of a vaso-occlusive painful crisis. P-selectin antibody therapy reduces hospitalization of patients with SCD by ∼50%, suggesting that an unknown P-selectin-independent mechanism promotes remaining vaso-occlusive events. In patients with SCD, intraerythrocytic polymerization of mutant hemoglobin promotes ischemia-reperfusion injury and hemolysis, which leads to the development of sterile inflammation. Using intravital microscopy in transgenic, humanized mice with SCD and in vitro studies with blood from patients with SCD, we reveal for the first time that the sterile inflammatory milieu in SCD promotes caspase-4/11-dependent activation of neutrophil-gasdermin D (GSDMD), which triggers P-selectin-independent shedding of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the liver. Remarkably, these NETs travel intravascularly from liver to lung, where they promote neutrophil-platelet aggregation and the development of acute lung injury. This study introduces a novel paradigm that liver-to-lung embolic translocation of NETs promotes pulmonary vascular vaso-occlusion and identifies a new GSDMD-mediated, P-selectin-independent mechanism of lung injury in SCD.",

      "abstract": "Inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients suggests that inflammasomes, proinflammatory intracellular complexes, regulate various steps of infection. Lung epithelial cells express inflammasome-forming sensors and constitute the primary entry door of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe that the NLRP1 inflammasome detects SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Specifically, human NLRP1 is cleaved at the Q333 site by multiple coronavirus 3CL proteases, which triggers inflammasome assembly and cell death and limits the production of infectious viral particles. Analysis of NLRP1-associated pathways unveils that 3CL proteases also inactivate the pyroptosis executioner Gasdermin D (GSDMD). Subsequently, caspase-3 and GSDME promote alternative cell pyroptosis. Finally, analysis of pyroptosis markers in plasma from COVID-19 patients with characterized severe pneumonia due to autoantibodies against, or inborn errors of, type I interferons (IFNs) highlights GSDME/caspase-3 as potential markers of disease severity. Overall, our findings identify NLRP1 as a sensor of SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung epithelia.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis, a life-threating illness caused by deregulated host immune responses to infections, is characterized by overproduction of multiple reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) and excessive pyroptosis, leading to high mortality. However, there is still no approved specific molecular therapy to treat sepsis. Here we reported drug-free tea polyphenols nanoparticles (TPNs) with intrinsic broad-spectrum RONS scavenging and pyroptosis-blocking activities to treat endotoxin (LPS)-induced sepsis in mice. The RONS scavenging activities originated from the polyphenols-derived structure, while the pyroptosis blockage was achieved by inhibiting gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediating the pore formation and membrane rupture, showing multifunctionalities for sepsis therapy. Notably, TPNs suppress GSDMD by inhibiting the oligomerization of GSDMD rather than the cleavage of GSDMD, thus displaying high pyroptosis-inhibition efficiency. As a result, TPNs showed an excellent therapeutic efficacy in sepsis mice model, as evidenced by survival rate improvement, hypothermia amelioration, and the organ damage protection. Collectively, TPNs present biocompatible candidates for the treatment of sepsis.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis remains one of the most common and lethal conditions globally. Currently, no proposed target specific to sepsis improves survival in clinical trials. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the pathogenesis of sepsis is needed to propel the discovery of effective treatment. Recently attention to sepsis has intensified because of a growing recognition of a non-canonical inflammasome-triggered lytic mode of cell death termed pyroptosis upon sensing cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Although the consequences of activation of the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome are similar, the non-canonical inflammasome formation requires caspase-4/5/11, which enzymatically cleave the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) and thereby cause pyroptosis. The non-canonical inflammasome assembly triggers such inflammatory cell death by itself; or leverages a secondary activation of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Excessive cell death induced by oligomerization of GSDMD and NINJ1 leads to cytokine release and massive tissue damage, facilitating devastating consequences and death. This review summarized the updated mechanisms that initiate and regulate non-canonical inflammasome activation and pyroptosis and highlighted various endogenous or synthetic molecules as potential therapeutic targets for treating sepsis.",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis is a form of cell death associated with inflammation. In the maintenance of airway homeostasis, pyroptosis goes through activation and assembly of Inflammasome. The pyroptosis pathway is mediated by caspase which activates the pore-forming effect of substrate gasdermin family members. It eventually leads to lysis and release of the cell contents and then induces an inflammatory response. In this process, it participates in airway homeostasis regulation by affecting airway immunity, airway epithelial structure and airway microbiota. Therefore, we discussed the correlation between airway immunity, airway epithelial structure, airway microbiota and the mechanism of pyroptosis to describe the role of pyroptosis in airway homeostasis regulation which is of great significance for understanding the occurrence and treatment of airway inflammatory diseases.",

Perforin-2, an innate immunity molecule against intracellular bacteria, limits cutaneous infection and dissemination of S. aureus in mice. Here, we report the intracellular accumulation of S. aureus in the epidermis of DFUs with no clinical signs of infection due to marked suppression of perforin-2. S. aureus residing within the epidermis of DFUs triggers AIM2 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. These findings were corroborated in mice lacking perforin-2. The effects of pyroptosis on DFU clinical outcomes were further elucidated in a 4-week longitudinal clinical study in patients with DFUs receiving standard care. Increased AIM2 inflammasome and ASC-pyroptosome coupled with induction of IL-1β were found in nonhealing DFUs compared with healing DFUs. Our findings revealed that perforin-2 suppression, intracellular S. aureus accumulation, and associated induction of pyroptosis contribute to healing inhibition and prolonged inflammation in patients with DFUs.",

      "abstract": "During the inflammatory storm of sepsis, a significant quantity of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are generated, which act as a double-edged sword and not only impede the invasion of foreign microorganisms but also exacerbate organ damage. This study provides evidence that NETs can cause damage to alveolar epithelial cells in vitro. The sepsis model developed in this study showed a significant increase in NETs in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The development of NETs has been shown to increase the lung inflammatory response and aggravate injury to alveolar epithelial cells. Bay-117082, a well-known NF-κB suppressor, is used to modulate inflammation. This analysis revealed that Bay-117082 efficiently reduced total protein concentration, myeloperoxidase activity, and inflammatory cytokines in BALF. Moreover, Bay-117082 inhibited the formation of NETs, which in turn prevented the activation of the pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD). In summary, these results indicated that excessive NET production during sepsis exacerbated the onset and progression of acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, Bay-117082 could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for ameliorating sepsis-associated ALI.",

      "title": "Inflammation unleashed: The role of pyroptosis in chronic liver diseases.",
      "abstract": "Pyroptosis, a newly identified form of programmed cell death intertwined with inflammatory responses, is facilitated by the Gasdermin family's pore-forming activity, leading to cell lysis and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This process is a double-edged sword in innate immunity, offering protection against pathogens while risking excessive inflammation and tissue damage when dysregulated. Specifically, pyroptosis operates through two distinct signaling pathways, namely the Caspase-1 pathway and the Caspase-4/5/11 pathway. In the context of chronic liver diseases like fibrosis and cirrhosis, inflammation emerges as a central contributing factor to their pathogenesis. The identification of inflammation is characterized by the activation of innate immune cells and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α. This review explores the interrelationship between pyroptosis and the inflammasome, a protein complex located in liver cells that recognizes danger signals and initiates Caspase-1 activation, resulting in the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. The article delves into the influence of the inflammasome and pyroptosis on various liver disorders, with a specific focus on their molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms. Additionally, the potential therapeutic implications of targeting pyroptosis for liver diseases are highlighted for future consideration.",

      "title": "Role of GSDM family members in airway epithelial cells of lung diseases: a systematic and comprehensive transcriptomic analysis.",
      "abstract": "Gasdermin (GSDM) family, the key executioners of pyroptosis, play crucial roles in anti-pathogen and anti-tumor immunities, although little is known about the expression of GSDM in lung diseases at single-cell resolution, especially in lung epithelial cells. We comprehensively investigated the transcriptomic profiles of GSDM members in various lung tissues from healthy subjects or patients with different lung diseases at single cell level, e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), or systemic sclerosis (SSC). The expression of GSDM members varied among pulmonary cell types (immune cells, structural cells, and especially epithelial cells) and even across lung diseases. Regarding disease-associated specificities, we found that GSDMC or GSDMD altered significantly in ciliated epithelia of COPD or LUAD, GSDMD in mucous, club, and basal cells of LUAD and GSDMC in mucous epithelia of para-tumor tissue, as compared with the corresponding epithelia of other diseases. The phenomic specificity of GSDM in lung cancer subtypes was noticed by comparing with 15 non-pulmonary cancers and para-cancer samples. GSDM family gene expression changes were also observed in different lung epithelial cell lines (e.g., HBE, A549, H1299, SPC-1, or H460) in responses to external challenges, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), cigarette smoking extract (CSE), cholesterol, and AR2 inhibitor at various doses or durations. GSDMA is rarely expressed in those cell lines, while GSDMB and GSDMC are significantly upregulated in human lung epithelia. Our data indicated that the heterogeneity of GSDM member expression exists at different cells, pathologic conditions, challenges, probably dependent upon cell biological phenomes, functions, and behaviors, upon cellular responses to external changes, and the nature and severity of lung disease. Thus, the deep exploration of GSDM phenomes may provide new insights into understanding the single-cell roles in the tissue, regulatory roles of the GSDM family in the pathogenesis, and potential values of biomarker identification and development.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is a key hallmark of injured type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECIIs) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Inhibiting mPTP opening in AECIIs is considered a potential IPF treatment. Herein, a \"double braking\" strategy on mPTP by cyclosporin A (CsA) derived ionizable lipid with 3D structure (3D-lipid) binding cyclophilin D (CypD) and siRNA downregulating mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) expression is proposed for treating IPF. 3D-lipid and MCU targeting siRNA (siMCU) are co-assembled to form stable 3D-LNP/siMCU nanoparticles (NPs), along with helper lipids. In vitro results demonstrated that these NPs effectively inhibit mPTP opening by 3D-lipid binding with CypD and siRNA downregulating MCU expression, thereby decreasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) release and suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in bleomycin-induced A549 cells. In vivo results revealed that 3D-LNP/siMCU NPs effectively ameliorated collagen deposition, pro-fibrotic factors secretion, and fibroblast activation in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF) mouse models. Moreover, compared to the commercial MC3-based formulation, optimized Opt-MC3/siRNA NPs with incorporating 3D-lipid as the fifth component, showed superior therapeutic efficacy against PF due to their enhanced stability and higher gene silencing efficiency. Overall, the nanomedicine containing 3D-lipid and siMCU will be a promising and potential approach for IPF treatment.",

      "abstract": "Cardiac dysfunction, an early complication of endotoxemia, is the major cause of death in intensive care units. No specific therapy is available at present for this cardiac dysfunction. Here, we show that the N-terminal gasdermin D (GSDMD-N) initiates mitochondrial apoptotic pore and cardiac dysfunction by directly interacting with cardiolipin oxidized by complex II-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during endotoxemia. Caspase-4/11 initiates GSDMD-N pores that are subsequently amplified by the upregulation and activation of NLRP3 inflammation through further generation of ROS. GSDMD-N pores form prior to BAX and VDAC1 apoptotic pores and further incorporate into BAX and VDAC1 oligomers within mitochondria membranes to exacerbate the apoptotic process. Our findings identify oxidized cardiolipin as the definitive target of GSDMD-N in mitochondria of cardiomyocytes during endotoxin-induced myocardial dysfunction (EIMD), and modulation of cardiolipin oxidation could be a therapeutic target early in the disease process to prevent EIMD.",

      "title": "Gasotransmitters and noble gases in cardioprotection: unraveling molecular pathways for future therapeutic strategies.",
      "abstract": "Despite recent progress, ischemic heart disease poses a persistent global challenge, driving significant morbidity and mortality. The pursuit of therapeutic solutions has led to the emergence of strategies such as ischemic preconditioning, postconditioning, and remote conditioning to shield the heart from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI). These ischemic conditioning approaches, applied before, after, or at a distance from the affected organ, inspire future therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological conditioning. Gasotransmitters, comprising nitric oxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide, play pivotal roles in physiological and pathological processes, exhibiting shared features such as smooth muscle relaxation, antiapoptotic effects, and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite potential risks at high concentrations, physiological levels of gasotransmitters induce vasorelaxation and promote cardioprotective effects. Noble gases, notably argon, helium, and xenon, exhibit organ-protective properties by reducing cell death, minimizing infarct size, and enhancing functional recovery in post-ischemic organs. The protective role of noble gases appears to hinge on their modulation of molecular pathways governing cell survival, leading to both pro- and antiapoptotic effects. Among noble gases, helium and xenon emerge as particularly promising in the field of cardioprotection. This overview synthesizes our current understanding of the roles played by gasotransmitters and noble gases in the context of MIRI and cardioprotection. In addition, we underscore potential future developments involving the utilization of noble gases and gasotransmitter donor molecules in advancing cardioprotective strategies.",

      "title": "The multifaceted roles of antimicrobial peptides in oral diseases.",
      "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are naturally occurring protein molecules with antibacterial, antiviral and/or antifungal activity. Some antimicrobial peptides kill microorganisms through direct binding with negatively charged microbial surfaces. This action disrupts the cytoplasmic membrane and leads to the leakage of the cytoplasm. In addition, they are involved in the innate immune response. Antimicrobial peptides play an important role in oral health, as natural antimicrobial peptides are the first line of host defence in response to microbial infection. The level of natural antimicrobial peptides increases during severe disease conditions and play a role in promoting the healing of oral tissues. However, they are insufficient for eliminating pathogenic micro-organisms. The variability of the oral environment can markedly reduce the effect of natural antimicrobial peptides. Thus, researchers are developing synthetic antimicrobial peptides with promising stability and biocompatibility. Synthetic antimicrobial peptides are a potential alternative to traditional antimicrobial therapy. Pertinent to oral diseases, the deregulation of antimicrobial peptides is involved in the pathogenesis of dental caries, periodontal disease, mucosal disease and oral cancer, where they can kill pathogenic microorganisms, promote tissue healing, serve as biomarkers and inhibit tumor cells. This narrative review provides an overview of the multifaceted roles of antimicrobial peptides in oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) has become a major threat in the treatment of bacterial infection, and immunotherapy in a non-antibiotic-dependent manner is an effective way to overcome CRAB infection. However, the role of the innate immune response in CRAB infection is poorly understood. Here, it is reported that CRAB infection induced a cytosolic DNA-sensing signaling pathway and significant IFN-β production in mice post-CRAB infection. The knockout of STING reduced bacterial burden, the production of inflammatory cytokines, and lung injury in mice post CRAB infection. The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) are required for CRAB-induced IFN-β expression in macrophages. Intriguingly, CRAB utilized outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to transport outer membrane protein 38 (OMP38) into mitochondria, triggering mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and activating the cGAS-STING signaling. Finally, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is demonstrated to block the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and ameliorate CRAB-induced excessive inflammatory response. These results demonstrated that the early innate immune response to CRAB infection is activated in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner, which could be a potential therapeutic target for CRAB infection.",

      "abstract": "Already for centuries, humankind is driven to understand the physiological and pathological mechanisms that occur in our brains. Today, we know that ion channels play an essential role in the regulation of neural processes and control many functions of the central nervous system. Ion channels present a diverse group of membrane-spanning proteins that allow ions to penetrate the insulating cell membrane upon opening of their channel pores. This regulated ion permeation results in different electrical and chemical signals that are necessary to maintain physiological excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain. Therefore, it is no surprise that disturbances in the functions of cerebral ion channels can result in a plethora of neurological disorders, which present a tremendous health care burden for our current society. The identification of ion channel-related brain disorders also fuel the research into the roles of ion channel proteins in various brain states. In the last decade, mounting evidence has been collected that indicates a pivotal role for transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels in the development and various physiological functions of the central nervous system. For instance, TRP channels modulate neurite growth, synaptic plasticity and integration, and are required for neuronal survival. Moreover, TRP channels are involved in numerous neurological disorders. TRPM3 belongs to the melastatin subfamily of TRP channels and represents a non-selective cation channel that can be activated by several different stimuli, including the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate, osmotic pressures and heat. The channel is best known as a peripheral nociceptive ion channel that participates in heat sensation. However, recent research identifies TRPM3 as an emerging new player in the brain. In this review, we summarize the available data regarding the roles of TRPM3 in the brain, and correlate these data with the neuropathological processes in which this ion channel may be involved.",

      "abstract": "As an executor of pyroptosis, gasdermin D (GSDMD) plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases and cancer. Thus, GSDMD is currently being widely explored as a drug target. Existing inhibitors targeting GSDMD, such as necrosulfonamide, disulfiram, and fumarate, primarily prevent pyroptosis by modifying human/mouse C191/C192 in the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD. However, cysteine modification can prevent the function of important proteins or enzymes, thereby leading to adverse reactions. Here, we chose an alternative key intervention site for GSDMD activation, which is located at the oligomerization interface I of its pore-forming structure. Through high-throughput virtual and experimental screening and in combination with efficacy and pharmacological validation, we have identified two safe, specific \"repurposed drugs\" that potently suppress GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis. Moreover, the candidates exhibited synergistic therapeutic effects of \"1 + 1>2\" in murine sepsis and tumorigenesis models. These recently identified GSDMD inhibitors hold great promise for clinical translation in the development of anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer immunotherapies.",

      "title": "Flummoxed by flux: the indeterminate principles of haemodialysis.",
      "abstract": "In haemodialysis (HD), unwanted substances (uraemic retention solutes or 'uraemic toxins') that accumulate in uraemia are removed from blood by transport across the semipermeable membrane. Like all membrane separation processes, the transport requires driving forces to facilitate the transfer of molecules across the membrane. The magnitude of the transport is quantified by the phenomenon of 'flux', a finite parameter defined as the volume of fluid (or permeate) transferred per unit area of membrane surface per unit time. In HD, as transmembrane pressure is applied to facilitate fluid flow or flux across the membrane to enhance solute removal, flux is defined by the ultrafiltration coefficient (KUF; mL/h/mmHg) reflecting the hydraulic permeability of the membrane. However, in HD, the designation of flux has come to be used in a much broader sense and the term is commonly used interchangeably and erroneously with other measures of membrane separation processes, resulting in considerable confusion. Increased flux is perceived to reflect more 'porous' membranes having 'larger' pores, even though other membrane and therapy attributes determine the magnitude of flux achieved during HD. Adjectival designations of flux (low-, mid-, high-, super-, ultra-) have found indiscriminate usage in the scientific literature to qualify a parameter that influences clinical decision making and prescription of therapy modalities (low-flux or high-flux HD). Over the years the concept and definition of flux has undergone arbitrary and periodic adjustment and redefinition by authors in publications, regulatory bodies (US Food and Drug Administration) and professional association guidelines (European Renal Association, Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative), with little consensus. Industry has stretched the boundaries of flux to derive marketing advantages, justify increased reimbursement or contrive new classes of therapy modalities when in fact flux is just one of several specifications that determine membrane or dialyser performance. Membranes considered as high-flux previously are today at the lower end of the flux spectrum. Further, additional parameters unrelated to the rate of diffusive or convective transport (flux) are used in conjunction with or in place of KUF to allude to flux: clearance (mL/min, e.g. of β",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis, a newly discovered form of programmed cell death, is characterized by cell swelling, the protrusion of large bubbles from the plasma membrane and cell lysis. This death pathway is mediated by the pore formation of gasdermin D (GSDMD), which is activated by human caspase-1/caspase-4/caspase-5 (or mouse caspase-1/caspase11), and followed with the releasing of both cell contents and proinflammatory cytokines. Pyroptosis was initially found to function as an innate immune effector mechanism to facilitate host defense against pathogenic microorganisms, and subsequent studies revealed that pyroptosis also plays an eventful role in inflammatory immune diseases and tumor resistance. Recent studies have also shown that pyroptosis is involved in the initiation, the progression and complications of atherosclerosis. Here, we provide an overview of the role of pyroptosis in atherosclerosis by focusing on three important participating cells: ECs, macrophages, and SMCs. In addition, we also summarized drugs and stimuli that regulate the progression of atherosclerosis by influencing cell pyroptosis.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, is a leading cause of death in intensive care units. The development of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction (SAOD) poses a threat to the survival of patients with sepsis. Unfortunately, the pathogenesis of sepsis and SAOD is complicated, multifactorial, and has not been completely clarified. Recently, numerous studies have demonstrated that pyroptosis, which is characterized by inflammasome and caspase activation and cell membrane pore formation, is involved in sepsis. Unlike apoptosis, pyroptosis is a pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death that participates in the regulation of immunity and inflammation. Related studies have shown that in sepsis, moderate pyroptosis promotes the clearance of pathogens, whereas the excessive activation of pyroptosis leads to host immune response disorders and SAOD. Additionally, transcription factors, non-coding RNAs, epigenetic modifications and post-translational modifications can directly or indirectly regulate pyroptosis-related molecules. Pyroptosis also interacts with autophagy, apoptosis, NETosis, and necroptosis. This review summarizes the roles and regulatory mechanisms of pyroptosis in sepsis and SAOD. As our understanding of the functions of pyroptosis improves, the development of new diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies associated with pyroptosis to improve clinical outcomes appears promising in the future.",

Porous microneedles (pMNs), special MNs with abundant interconnected pores that can produce capillary action, are gaining increasing attention as a novel MNs technology. pMNs can actively adsorb bioactive ingredients from solutions of drugs or vaccines for in vivo delivery or from interstitial skin fluids (ISFs) for wearable and point-of-care testing (POCT) products. Different pore sizes and porosities of pMNs can be achieved with different materials and preparation processes, which makes the application of pMNs adaptable to multiple scenarios. In addition, easier and faster detection will be accomplished by the smart combination of pMNs with other detection technologies. This paper aims to summarize the recent research progress of pMNs, focusing on the influence of various materials and their corresponding preparation methods on its structure and function display, discussing the key issues and looking forward to the future development.",

      "abstract": "Without appropriate treatment, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection can cause life-threatening diseases (e.g., meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, and sepsis). However, a rapid and accurate point-of-care test for the infection remains challenging. The bacterium secretes α-hemolysin (Hla), which spontaneously binds to the cell membrane of erythrocyte, and eventually lyses the cell via pore formation. Taking advantage of this phenomenon, we apply the erythrocyte membrane (EM) extracted from human whole blood as a novel bioreceptor for detecting Hla, fabricating erythrocyte-camouflaged biosensors (ECB) by coating EM onto electrochemical impedance electrodes. We verify the existence of EM on the ECB by using confocal microscopy and atomic force microscopy. We demonstrate that ECBs sensitively detect Hla spiked in phosphate buffer saline and human serum. Also, the sensor shows higher sensitivity to Hla than major blood proteins, such as human serum albumin, fibrinogen, and gamma globulin. Specifically, the signal intensities for Hla are 8.8-12.7 times higher than those in the same concentration of those blood proteins. The detection limit of the ECB for Hla is 1.9 ng/ml while the dynamic range is 0.0001-1 mg/ml. Finally, we validate the constant sensing performance of ECB with 99.0 ± 5.6% accuracy for 35 days of storage.",

      "abstract": "Pyroptosis, belonging to programmed cell death, is shown to be mediated by gasdermin D (GSDMD) and gains more and more attention in innate immunity and multiple diseases. However, the role of GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in peritoneal fibrosis (PF) remains unclear. This study observed NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in the peritoneum of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with PF. Moreover, it is found that high glucose (HG) can induce the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by regulating TLR4/NF-κB and JNK/p38 MAPK signaling in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs), leading to subsequent Caspase-1 activation. The cleaved Caspase-1 promoted pyroptosis-related transmembrane pore formation through activating GSDMD-N, and stimulated the HPMCs to secrete inflammatory factors including IL-1β and IL-18. GSDMD global deletion or pharmacologic pretreatment with Caspase-1 specific inhibitor VX-765 effectively inhibited the pyroptosis and inflammation, thereby ameliorating PF. Additionally, treatment with VX-765 and transfected with Caspase-1 siRNA or GSDMD siRNA also inhibited the transmembrane pore formation and inflammatory factors secretion in HG-induced HPMCs. Consistent with these results, delayed treatment with VX-765 also alleviated PF, indicating the therapeutic effect of VX-765. Taken together, the results demonstrate that pyroptosis may be a novel therapeutic target for peritoneal fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Gasdermins (GSDMs) serve as pivotal executors of pyroptosis and play crucial roles in host defence, cytokine secretion, innate immunity, and cancer. However, excessive or inappropriate GSDMs activation is invariably accompanied by exaggerated inflammation and results in tissue damage. In contrast, deficient or impaired activation of GSDMs often fails to promptly eliminate pathogens, leading to the increasing severity of infections. The activity of GSDMs requires meticulous regulation. The dynamic modulation of GSDMs involves many aspects, including autoinhibitory structures, proteolytic cleavage, lipid binding and membrane translocation (oligomerization and pre-pore formation), oligomerization (pore formation) and pore removal for membrane repair. As the most comprehensive and efficient regulatory pathway, posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are widely implicated in the regulation of these aspects. In this comprehensive review, we delve into the complex mechanisms through which a variety of proteases cleave GSDMs to enhance or hinder their function. Moreover, we summarize the intricate regulatory mechanisms of PTMs that govern GSDMs-induced pyroptosis.",

      "abstract": "The Jafron series of sorbent cartridges provides a comprehensive array of coated, highly biocompatible sorbent beads made of styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers. Such beads carry a mean diameter of 0.8 mm with a range from 0.60 to 1.18 mm. The maximal pore size of these coated beads and the volume of the cartridge vary according to the type of cartridge ranging between 50 Da and 60 kDa. The sorbents, the size of the cartridge, the volume of sorbent, and the pore size (which reaches 60 kDa with the HA330 cartridge) aim to take advantage of the principles of molecular adsorption in a variety of diseases from uremic toxin retention to poisoning and drug overdose, from kidney disease to liver failure, from acute respiratory distress syndrome to sepsis, from toxic skin injury to COVID-19. The preliminary data from ex vivo studies, animal investigations, and human pilot work look promising and justify a program of systematic investigation of these products to advance our understanding of how they may be incorporated into our therapeutic arsenal.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging has become a recurring concern even for younger people, mainly owing to increased life expectancy. In this context, the use of nutricosmetics as supplements has increased in recent years. Moreover, numerous scientific studies have shown the benefits of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation in improving the signs of skin aging. The objective of this study was to summarize the evidence on the effects of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation on human skin through a systematic review followed by a meta-analysis of clinical trials focusing on the process of skin aging. A literature search was conducted in the Medline, Embase, Cochrane, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine databases. Eligible studies were randomized, double-blind, and controlled trials that evaluated oral supplementation with hydrolyzed collagen as an intervention and reported at least one of the following outcomes: skin wrinkles, hydration, elasticity, and firmness. After retrieving articles from the databases, 19 studies were selected, with a total of 1,125 participants aged between 20 and 70 years (95% women). In the meta-analysis, a grouped analysis of studies showed favorable results of hydrolyzed collagen supplementation compared with placebo in terms of skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles. The findings of improved hydration and elasticity were also confirmed in the subgroup meta-analysis. Based on results, ingestion of hydrolyzed collagen for 90 days is effective in reducing skin aging, as it reduces wrinkles and improves skin elasticity and hydration.",

      "abstract": "Aging skin, wrinkles, pigmentation, and dryness are problems that plague people, and researchers are working to solve them. Recent studies have shown that intestinal microbiota homeostasis can influence skin health, demonstrating the existence of a gut-skin axis. Recently, improving skin health through probiotic interventions has been proposed, and micro-ecological skin care is becoming a popular concept. By regulating skin health and gut-skin axis interactions, probiotics can be used as potential management tools to suppress and improve skin diseases in multiple ways, including decreasing oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory responses, and keeping immune effects. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the application and mechanisms of probiotic-mediated gut microbiota homeostasis in skin care and to offer a theoretical basis for the application of probiotics in skin care.",

It is a naturally occurring component of skin, and there is a negligible risk of immunologic or allergic reaction with injection. It is rapidly degraded by the injection of hyaluronidase, thus creating an ideal injectable material that is low risk and reversible.

      "abstract": "UVB radiation induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation, leading to skin wrinkling, compromised barrier function, and an increased risk of carcinogenesis. Addressing or preventing photoaging may offer a promising therapeutic avenue for these conditions. Recent research indicated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit significant therapeutic potential for various skin diseases. Given that extracellular vesicles (EV) can deliver diverse cargo to recipient cells and elicit similar therapeutic effects, we investigated the roles and underlying mechanisms of both adipose-derived MSC-derived EV (AMSC-EV) and umbilical cord-derived MSC-derived EV (HUMSC-EV) in photoaging. Our findings indicated that in vivo, treatment with AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV resulted in improvements in wrinkles and skin hydration while also mitigating skin inflammation and thickness alterations in both the epidermis and dermis. Additionally, in vitro studies using human keratinocytes (HaCaTs), human dermal fibroblast cells (HDFs), and T-Skin models revealed that AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV attenuated senescence, reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage, and alleviated inflammation induced by UVB. Furthermore, EV treatment enhanced cell viability and migration capacity in the epidermis and promoted extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in the dermis in photoaged cell models. Mechanistically, proteomics results showed that TIMP1 was highly expressed in both AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV and could exert similar effects as MSC-EV. In addition, we found that EV and TIMP1 could inhibit Notch1 and downstream targets Hes1, P16, P21, and P53. Collectively, our data suggests that both AMSC-EV and HUMSC-EV attenuate skin photoaging through TIMP1/Notch1.",

This review aims to provide an overview of the current practices and perceived effectiveness of polynucleotides in aesthetic medicine. A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted using keywords related to polynucleotides, cosmetic application, and aesthetic application. Studies were selected based on their relevance to aesthetic medicine and the inclusion of human subjects. The review found that polynucleotides have been used to improve skin texture, reduce wrinkle depth, and enhance facial appearance. The studies reported varying degrees of efficacy and safety, with some studies demonstrating significant improvements in skin elasticity and hydration. However, others reported limited or no benefits. The review also highlighted the need for further research to establish the optimal use and efficacy of polynucleotides in aesthetic medicine. While the existing literature suggests that polynucleotides may have potential benefits in aesthetic medicine, more research is needed to fully understand their mechanisms of action and optimal use. Clinicians should be aware of the current limitations and potential risks associated with the use of polynucleotides in aesthetic medicine.",

      "title": "Top weapons in skin aging and actives to target the consequences of skin cell senescence.",
      "abstract": "Skin aging has long been considered a purely cosmetic problem. However, as life expectancy increases, skin aging is taking on a functional dimension that goes beyond cosmetics and appearance. Preventive or therapeutic strategies are needed to target cellular senescence, a key process underlying the alterations in skin function and appearance that occur with aging, as well as to address the age-related skin changes associated with 'dermatoporosis' and chronic skin insufficiency/fragility syndrome. Thus, given the need for effective anti-aging products that improve both the appearance and function of the skin, it is essential to distinguish active ingredients that have been proven to be effective, among the large number of available over-the-counter cosmeceuticals. This brief review focuses on a core group of topical actives, describing their clinical effects on senescence and aging, and their molecular mechanisms of action. These actives include hyaluronic acid, which has hydrating and viscoelastic properties and has been shown to reduce skin atrophy; retinaldehyde, which activates retinoid receptors and increases cutaneous elasticity; vitamins C and E, which provide stable oxidative protection; and niacinamide, which reduces inflammation and mitigates the effects of senescence.",

      "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based injectables continue to grow in popularity and are used worldwide to improve facial changes associated with aging. Profhilo® Structura (IBSA Farmaceutici Italia, Lodi, Italy) is a novel HA-based product that uses nano hybrid complex of hyaluronic acid (NAHYCO)® technology to create hybrid cooperative complexes consisting of high and low molecular weight HA. Profhilo® Structura's high concentration (45 mg of total HA) and rheological properties (ie, viscosity [resistance to flow] and elasticity [stickiness]) have been specially formulated to restore facial adipose tissue. Because of their early involvement in the facial aging process, the superficial medial and lateral-temporal cheek fat compartments are good candidates for treatment. However, recommendations and guidelines are necessary to ensure that treatment is safe and effective. Three experts were invited to IBSA Farmaceutici Italia Srl to discuss clinical rationale, optimal injection techniques, and clinical outcomes for treating the superficial medial and lateral-temporal cheek fat compartments with Profhilo® Structura. These techniques were developed using patients presenting with either initial hypotrophy of fat compartments within the preauricular area (ie, sinkers) or jowl sagging due to hypotrophy within the preauricular and zygomatic areas (ie, saggers). Targeting these areas using the optimal injection site can maximize product diffusion and minimize the risk for vascular compromise. Targeting these areas also leads to lateral tightening and lipolifting effects due to adipose tissue restoration. The experts agreed that Profhilo® Structura is currently the first and only HA-based injectable treatment that can integrate and restore the adipose tissue in these affected fat compartments.",

      "abstract": "Cosmeceuticals, the bridge between pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, contain biologically active ingredients that may improve the skin's overall appearance. As the market, accessibility, and popularity of cosmeceuticals increase, it is essential to understand the safety and efficacy of such products. This systematic review aims to examine published clinical studies involving the use of cosmeceuticals for antiaging to provide evidence-based recommendations based on available efficacy and safety data. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically searched on January 1, 2023 using PRISMA guidelines. Strength of evidence was graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. Clinical recommendations were made based on the quality of the existing literature. A total of 153 articles regarding the use of cosmeceuticals for treatment of antiaging were identified. After screening of titles, abstracts, and full text, 32 studies involving 1236 patients met inclusion criteria, including 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 non-randomized open-label clinical trials for Vitamin C, Retinol, Bakuchiol, Tetrahydrojasmonic acid, Growth Factors, Methyl Estradiolpropanoate, Timosaponin A-III (TA-III), Protocatechuic acid, Grammatophyllum speciosum, and Jasmine rice panicle extract. Retinol and vitamin C for antiaging received a Grade A for recommendation. Methyl estradiolpropanoate, bakuchiol, tetrahydrojasmonic acid, and growth factors received a recommendation grade of C. The remaining ingredients were assigned an inconclusive grade of recommendation due to lack of evidence. Cosmeceuticals included in the review had favorable safety profiles with few significant adverse events. The review analyzes numerous different ingredients to provide an evidence-based approach to decision-making for consumers and physicians on the use of cosmeceuticals for antiaging. Limitations to our review include a limited number of randomized controlled trials and a need for long-term data on each cosmeceutical's efficacy and safety. Future research is needed to establish the long-term effectiveness and safety of cosmeceuticals.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess skin elasticity, the reduction in the number and the depth of wrinkles and changes in the other skin defects (bags under the eyes, dark circles under the eyes, skin hyperpigmentation in the ageing eye area following the use of non-ablative fractional laser, bipolar radiofrequency and intense pulsed light). Moreover, the study was also comparison which device brought better results than the others. This study included 71 patients (66 women, 5 men), aged 33-63 years (the average age was 45.81 years) with skin phototypes II and III. Twenty-four patients received five treatment sessions with a 1410-nm non-ablative fractional laser in 2-week intervals, 23 patients received five treatment sessions with a bipolar radiofrequency in 1-week intervals and 24 patients received five treatment sessions with an intense pulsed light in 2-week intervals. The treatment was applied on the skin in the eye area. The Cutometer (Courage + Khazaka electronic) reference test was used as an objective method for the assessment of skin elasticity. A questionnaire was used to compare baseline state with changes that occurred after the series of treatment sessions. The results of cutometric measurements of R2, R6 and R7 parameters and the results of questionnaires indicated that non-ablative fractional laser therapy, bipolar radiofrequency and intense pulsed light improved skin elasticity. Of the three treatments, the most significant percentage improvement in the R6 parameter was demonstrated by non-ablative fractional laser therapy which gave better final results than the other methods (p < 0.0001). No other statistically significant relationships were found between RF and IPL. In the (subjective) opinion of study participants (questionnaire), all used methods resulted in the reduction of the amount and the depth of wrinkles. However, they did not observe significant impact of individual treatment method on the signs of skin ageing, including discolorations within eye area, bags (fatty hernia), dark circles (vascular/pigmentary) and oedema (predisposition to water retention). Non-ablative fractional laser therapy, bipolar radiofrequency and intense pulsed light improved skin elasticity and the reduction of wrinkles. The most significant improvement of elasticity was demonstrated by laser therapy. It seems necessary to expand the group with the effect of individual treatments against bags and dark circles under the eyes.",

      "title": "Resveratrol activates autophagy and protects from UVA-induced photoaging in human skin fibroblasts and the skin of male mice by regulating the AMPK pathway.",
      "abstract": "Skin photoaging is mostly caused by ultraviolet A (UVA), although active medications to effectively counteract UVA-induced photoaging have not yet been created. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol found in the skin of grapes, has been shown to have various biological functions such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. However, the role of resveratrol in UVA-induced photoaging has not been clarified. We investigated the mechanism of action of resveratrol by UVA irradiation of human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and innovatively modified a mouse model of photoaging. The results demonstrated that resveratrol promoted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation to activate autophagy, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibit apoptosis, and restore normal cell cycle to alleviate UVA-induced photoaging. In addition, subcutaneous injection of resveratrol not only improved the symptoms of roughness, erythema, and increased wrinkles in the skin of UVA photodamaged mice, but also alleviated epidermal hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation, reduced inflammatory responses, and inhibited collagen fiber degradation. In conclusion, our studies proved that resveratrol can treat UVA-induced photoaging and elucidated the possible molecular mechanisms involved, providing a new therapeutic strategy for future anti-aging.",

      "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is present in all connective tissues and organs, including the skin and joint fluid. However, few clinical trials have comprehensively evaluated the impacts of oral HA on skin conditions, including wrinkles and moisturization. In this study, we conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial of daily HA (120 mg) intake for 12 weeks in 40 healthy Asian men and women (aged 35-64 years). Skin condition was determined by the evaluation of wrinkles, stratum corneum water content, the amount of transepidermal water loss, elasticity, and through image analysis. After 12 weeks, skin condition was significantly improved in terms of wrinkle assessment, stratum corneum water content, transepidermal water loss, and elasticity in the HA group compared to the placebo group. Regarding the percentage change from baseline, wrinkle assessment, stratum corneum water content, and skin elasticity were significantly improved in the HA group versus the placebo group after 8 and 12 weeks of ingestion. The present findings indicate that oral ingestion of HA may suppress wrinkles and improve skin condition.",

      "title": "Cosmeceuticals: A Review of Clinical Studies Claiming to Contain Specific, Well-Characterized Strains of Probiotics or Postbiotics.",
      "abstract": "The skin serves as a critical barrier against external threats-dehydration, ultraviolet exposure, and infections-playing a significant role in internal homeostasis and moisture retention. Additionally, and equally importantly, it interacts dynamically with the complex microbiome resident in it, which is essential for maintaining skin health. Recent interest has focused on the use of probiotics and postbiotics, besides their ability to modulate the skin microbiome, to enhance barrier function, and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, to be involved in skincare, by having the potential to improve skin hydration, elasticity, and overall appearance, as well as in reducing signs of aging, such as wrinkles and fine lines. The products-being a combination of a cosmetic regime plus probiotic[s] or postbiotic[s]-are named cosmeceuticals. However, to comply with the regulations for the characterization of a microorganism as a specific probiotic strain, the pro- or postbiotics incorporated into the cosmetic regime should be both genetically and phenotypically defined. Thus, in this review, we present 14 published clinical trials using such cosmetic products with specific, well-characterized strains of probiotics or postbiotics applied to volunteers with healthy skin. Looking at the results of these studies collectively, we can say that these genetically and phenotypically defined strains of either live or inanimate bacteria and/or their components seem to keep the treated skin at least fully hydrated, with intact epithelial tone, increased radiance, and with decreased wrinkle depth, while normalizing the commensal skin microbiota. Future advancements in personalized skin care may lead to genomic sequencing and metabolomics to tailor probiotic and postbiotic treatments to individual skin microbiomes, promising a new frontier in cosmeceuticals.",

      "title": "Male facial rejuvenation using a combination 633, 830, and 1072 nm LED face mask.",
      "abstract": "Home-based photobiomodulation is a popular treatment modality for patients seeking non-invasive aesthetic treatment. Studies demonstrate that photobiomodulation is effective for skin rejuvenation, which is aimed at improving the overall appearance of the skin by reducing fine lines and wrinkles and improving skin texture, skin tone, and dyspigmentation. Most current skin rejuvenation research focuses on treatments in women. However, men's aesthetics remains an underserved market. A combined red light (RL) and near-infrared (NIR) light-emitting diode (LED) has been designed specifically to target male skin, which may have different physiological and biophysical properties compared to female skin. Herein, the safety and efficacy of a commercially available RL and NIR (633, 830, and 1072 nm) LED array designed to be worn as a face mask was assessed. Primary outcomes included adverse events and facial rejuvenation as determined by participant-reported satisfaction scales and quantitative digital skin photography and computer analysis after 6 weeks of treatment. The participants reported overall favorable results and improvements in all individual categories, were satisfied with the treatment, and would recommend the product to others. The participants perceived the greatest improvement in fine lines and wrinkles, skin texture, and youthful appearance. Photographic digital analysis demonstrated favorable improvements in wrinkles, UV spots, brown spots, pores, and porphyrins. These results support the use of RL and NIR to treat male skin. Advantages of the LED facemask include its safety, efficacy, convenient home-based use, minimal associated downtime, simple operation, non-invasiveness, and appreciable results in as few as 6 weeks.",

      "abstract": "The integration of skincare into medical practice can enhance patient care. Understanding the anatomy and physiology of the skin is the foundation for effective skincare interventions. Genetic and inflammatory conditions play a significant role in aesthetic skin physiology. There are key active ingredients that are pivotal in addressing various skin concerns. Sunscreens provide crucial protection against UV radiation, while pigment control agents such as hydroquinone, kojic acid, and arbutin target the melanin pathway. Exfoliating agents and skin turnover enhancers such as retinoids and hydroxy acids promote skin renewal and rejuvenation. In addition, ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, ceramides, niacinamide, antioxidants, peptides, and botanicals contribute to improving skin quality. Adding skincare to medical practice requires careful product selection, patient education, and marketing strategies.",

This study aims to investigate how oral supplementation of a soy protein isolate with added isoflavones (SPII) affects components of photoaging such as facial wrinkles and dyspigmentation, and skin biophysical measures such as skin hydration and sebum excretion in postmenopausal women. This 6-month prospective, randomized double-blind controlled study was conducted on 44 postmenopausal women with Fitzpatrick skin types I, II, and III who were randomized to receive either casein protein or SPII. A high-resolution facial photography system was used to measure wrinkle severity and pigmentation at 0, 8, 16, and 24 weeks. Skin biophysical measurements included skin hydration and sebum production. The average wrinkle severity was decreased in the SPII intervention group at week 16 and week 24 by 5.9% and 7.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline. Compared to the casein group, average wrinkle severity was significantly decreased at week 16 (",

In this context, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral supplementation with hydrolyzed fish cartilage for the improvement of chronological and photoaging-induced skin changes. A total of 46 healthy females aged 45 to 59 years were enrolled and divided into two groups: G1-placebo and G2-oral treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage. Measurements of skin wrinkles, dermis echogenicity and thickness, and morphological and structural characteristics of the skin were performed in the nasolabial region of the face before and after a 90-day period of treatment using high-resolution imaging, ultrasound, and reflectance confocal microscopy image analyses. A significant reduction in wrinkles and an increase of dermis echogenicity were observed after a 90-day period of treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage compared to the placebo and baseline values. In addition, reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) image analysis showed improved collagen morphology and reduced elastosis after treatment with hydrolyzed fish cartilage. The present study showed the clinical benefits for the skin obtained with oral supplementation with a low dose of collagen peptides from hydrolyzed fish cartilage.",

Circadian regulation ensures optimal DNA repair following UVR-induced damage, reducing mutation accumulation, and enhancing genomic stability. The circadian control over cell proliferation and apoptosis further contributes to skin regeneration and response to UVR. Oxidative stress management is another critical area where circadian rhythms exert influence. Key circadian genes like brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (",

      "abstract": "Inflammaging has long been linked to the pathogenesis of various aging-associated disorders, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Yet, the origins of inflammaging remain unclear. Although inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis predispose to the development of certain aging-associated disorders, suggesting a pathogenic role of cutaneous inflammation in these disorders, the great majority of aged humans do not have inflammatory dermatoses. Nonetheless, recent studies point to epidermal dysfunction as contributing to inflammaging, even in otherwise normal aged humans. Chronologically aged skin exhibits reduced stratum corneum hydration levels, delayed permeability barrier recovery, and an elevated stratum corneum pH, all of which can provoke and exacerbate cutaneous inflammation. Owing to the prolonged release of proinflammatory cytokines (including TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6) from the epidermis into the circulation in response to these functional abnormalities, cutaneous inflammation can lead to extracutaneous inflammation, resulting in the downstream development of inflammaging and its accompanying disorders. In support of this concept, topical therapies that improve epidermal function can mitigate some aging-associated disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment. In this perspective, we discuss the link between epidermal dysfunction and inflammaging and highlight the potential management of inflammaging-associated sequelae by enhancing epidermal functions.",

      "abstract": "Intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including lifestyle and sun exposure, can contribute to cell senescence, which impairs skin homeostasis, that may in turn lead to skin aging. Senescent cells have a specific secretome, called the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that includes MMPs, CXCLs and S100A8/9. Reducing the SASP with senotherapeutics is a promising strategy to reduce skin aging. Here we evaluated the effect of a formula containing niacinamide and hyaluronic acid, which are known to limit senescence and skin aging. We conducted three different studies. (1) Ex vivo explants treated with the formula had more collagen and glycosaminoglycan. (2) In a clinical trial with forty-four women, two months of treatment improved fine lines, wrinkles, luminosity, smoothness, homogeneity, and plumpness. (3) In a third study on thirty women, we treated one arm for two months and took skin biopsies to study gene expression. 101 mRNAs and 13 miRNAs were differentially expressed. We observed a likely senomorphic effect, as there was a decrease in many SASP genes including MMP12 and CXCL9 and a significant downregulation of autocrine signaling genes: S100A8 and S100A9. These pharmaco-clinical results are the first to demonstrate the senomorphic properties of an effective anti-aging formula in skin.",

      "abstract": "Crow's feet lines in the lateral canthal region are a common concern among aging patients, initially appearing as dynamic wrinkles during facial expressions and becoming more pronounced with age. Botulinum neurotoxin temporarily paralyzes muscles by inhibiting acetylcholine release, smoothing wrinkles and enhancing skin's youthful appearance. Effective treatment requires tailored approaches considering individual anatomy and muscle activity. Recent cadaveric studies identified the tear trough muscle, emphasizing its role in infraorbital support and aging. Clinically, patients often present medial eye wrinkles after BoNT treatment for crow's feet, prompting exploration of underlying mechanisms and management strategies. Three cases demonstrated that medial BoNT injections in the orbicularis oculi muscle significantly improve medial eye wrinkles and tear trough appearance. The study underscores the importance of understanding muscle hyperactivity and anatomical variations for precise treatment. Enhanced injection techniques targeting specific areas can achieve better outcomes and minimize complications, particularly in culturally sensitive regions where facial expressions are valued. This research highlights the necessity for comprehensive anatomical knowledge and patient-specific treatment strategies to address medial eye wrinkles effectively.",

      "abstract": "Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure is the primary cause of skin photoaging, leading to wrinkles, pigmentation changes, and loss of dermal elasticity. This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of topical compounds for treating skin photoaging. A comprehensive search identified 23 RCTs with 3905 participants, comparing anti-aging agents. Bayesian network meta-analysis showed isotretinoin, retinol, and tretinoin significantly improved fine wrinkles, with isotretinoin ranked highest. Tazarotene was most effective for coarse wrinkles, while glycolic acid reduced roughness. Tretinoin and retinol were superior for hyperpigmentation. Safety analysis indicated tretinoin had the most favorable profile, whereas tazarotene and glycolic acid had higher adverse event risks. Isotretinoin and tretinoin emerged as the most balanced treatments across efficacy and safety. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for clinical decision-making in anti-photoaging therapy and underscore the potential for these agents to be integrated into routine dermatologic practice, particularly for patients seeking effective and well-tolerated topical interventions. However, limitations included limited racial diversity, potential commercial bias, and variability in dermatological assessments. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for clinical decision-making in anti-photoaging therapy.",

      "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers skin aging primarily by disrupting skin barrier function, resulting in dry skin and wrinkle formation. Oyster hydrolysate (OH), as a functional food, has been reported for anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. This study investigated the underlying mechanism of OH effect on UVB-induced skin aging in SKH1 hairless mice. Mice were exposed to UVB three times per week while they were fed with a normal diet or diet containing OH for 10 weeks. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed to investigate the OH effect on human skin moisturizing to evaluate its efficacy and safety. UVB exposure increased parameters of skin aging; dehydration, transepidermal water loss, and macroscopic dorsal skin lesions. OH significantly reduced these features of skin aging. Histological analysis demonstrated that OH decreased skin epidermal and dermal thickness and collagen degradation induced by UVB. OH significantly reduced ROS production, suppressed macrophage activation and neutrophil infiltration, and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. OH improved skin barrier function by increasing the expression of filaggrin, aquaporin-3, and hyaluronic acid synthesis enzymes and promoting recovery from skin damage. Importantly, the results from a human clinical trial demonstrated that OH improved skin moisturization and integrity with no side effects. Taken together, OH supplementation ameliorates skin damage via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and enhances skin hydration and barrier function. OH has a therapeutic potential for skin photoaging.",

      "abstract": "Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight accelerates skin ageing, which is followed by harsh, thick, dry and loose conditions. One of the most demonstrative symptoms is deep wrinkles induced by skin barrier disruption. Our previous research showed that Phaseolus angularis seed extract (PASE) effectively inhibits skin ageing through UVB protection in HaCaT cells by suppressing skin damage. However, its efficacy has not been evaluated in clinical trials so far. PASE cream's effectiveness was initially tested on the artificial skin model, revealing an increase in filaggrin and defence against skin damage. Based on these results, in this single-centred, randomized, double-blind study, we investigated the anti-ageing effect of PASE in human eye wrinkle areas. For these 21 healthy adult women aged 30 to 59, a PASE cream was applied to the right eye wrinkle area and a placebo to the left eye wrinkle area twice a day (morning and evening) for 12 weeks. The change in thick, deep crease wrinkles around the eyes was confirmed by visual evaluation, skin measurements and a questionnaire. As a result, the surface roughness (R1), maximum roughness (R2), average roughness (R3), smoothness depth (R4) and arithmetic mean roughness (R5) values in the group using the PASE cream all decreased. Particularly, R1, R4 and R5 significantly decreased by 18.1%, 18.6% and 25.0%, respectively. Subjects who applied PASE cream also experienced an improvement in skin moisture nearly twice the time compared to the placebo group. In addition, no participants reported side effects. Our study showed that PASE cream led to clinically significant levels of wrinkle improvement. In conclusion, as PASE is a natural, safe food with no side effects, it can be a good resource for natural anti-wrinkle functional cosmetics in the future.",

      "abstract": "Gradually, loss of skin elasticity and elastic properties occurs after 30 years of age and will be associated with several changes, including creating wrinkles, skin laxity (sagging skin), and skin blemishes. In general, people all over the world are looking for ways to keep their facial skin young over time. There are several strategies to skin rejuvenate, including invasive and non-invasive methods. However, invasive methods have less popularity than non-invasive methods due to their need for specialist physicians (medical expertise), localized neuropathic pains for patients, the prevalence and incidence of skin infections, and high-cost clinical services. In the meantime, skin hydration is one of the simplest non-invasive methods for skin rejuvenation, and HA, with anti-aging and skin collagen-stimulating properties, has been introduced as a natural skin moisturizing agent. Therefore, since this composition maintains facial skin moisture and radiance, and improves its elasticity, it has always been considered by experts and specialist physicians. On the other hand, due to its lipophilic properties, hydrophilic macromolecules containing HA cannot pass through the stratum corneum. However, they have temporary and superficial softening effects on the skin. Hence, some nanocarriers have been suggested to overcome this problem and develop the properties and positive influences of HA on skin rejuvenation. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce some new non-invasive approaches in facial skin rejuvenation, including applying liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, and ionic liquids, to transport HA into the inner and deeper layers of the skin, including Dermis. In this review article, we examine non-invasive methods using nanoparticles to deliver HA to the epidermis and dermis of the skin for skin rejuvenation.",

Diagnosis is often challenging due to its rarity and resemblance to other pigmented lesions. This report presents a clinical case, a diagnostic algorithm, and treatment recommendations, emphasizing the role of thorough examination and questioning. We describe the case of a 64-year-old woman of Amerindian (Maya) heritage from Yucatan, Mexico, who presented with a three-month history of a slowly growing dark spot on her left palm. The lesion was asymptomatic, non-scaling, and non-palpable. Palmar skin scrapings, prepared with KOH, revealed pigmented yeast and hyphae, leading to a diagnosis of tinea nigra. Following treatment with topical ketoconazole, the patient's lesions completely resolved at the one-month follow-up. The cultivation of scales confirmed the presence of ",

The key criteria to validate the treatment effectiveness is to ensure the photocoagulation temperature between 60 and 70 °C is reached in the treatment region of interest. The model presented consists of truncated volumes of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and adjacent retinal tissues. Two cases of choroid pigmentation are modelled to signify extreme cases of human eye difference: albino and dark colour choroid pigmentation. Conditions for consistent heating over the irradiated treatment spot is modelled for laser beams with different intensity profiles: 'top-hat', Gaussian and 'donut' modes. The simulation considers both uniform heating within retinal tissue layers and spatial intensity decay due to absorption along the direction of laser propagation. For a 500",

As one of the main leaf diseases of P. heterophylla, black spot seriously affects the yield and quality of the medicinal material. To identify and characterize the pathogens causing black spot, we isolated the pathogens, identified them as a species of Alternaria according to Koch's postulates, and then tested their pathogenicity and biological characteristics. The results showed that the pathogens causing P. heterophylla black spot were A. gaisen, as evidenced by the similar colony morphology, spore characteristics, sporulation phenotype, and the same clade with A. gaisen on the phylogenetic tree(the maximum likelihood support rate of 100% and the Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00) built based on the tandem sequences of ITS, tef1, gapdh, endoPG, Alta1, OPA10-2, and KOG1077. The optimum conditions for mycelial growth of the pathogen were 25 ℃, pH 5-8, and 24 h dark culture. The lethal conditions for mycelia and spores were both treatment at 50 ℃ for 10 min. We reported for the first time the A. gaisen-caused black spot of P. heterophylla. The results could provide a theoretical basis for the diagnosis and control of P. heterophylla leaf spot diseases.",

      "abstract": "To determine the effectiveness of conjunctivoplasty using a modified argon laser photocoagulation method on patients with conjunctivochalasis (CCh). This study included 25 cases of symptomatic inferior CCh. After staining the surface of a redundant conjunctiva using a dark-purple marker, low-energy argon laser photocoagulation (500 μm spot size for 0.5 seconds at power 300 mW) was applied under topical anesthesia for a mean of 80 times. The patients were aged 67.6 ± 7.1 years (mean ± standard deviation). During a mean follow-up period of 7.8 months (range of 6-12 months), the CCh grades of 21 eyes (84%) decreased after laser conjunctivoplasty. Calculated reduction rates of grades 1, 2, and 3 were 90%, 75%, and 67%, respectively. Patient subjective symptoms were improved in 80% of cases. No postoperative complications such as conjunctival scarring or persistent ocular irritation were observed. Our modified argon laser photocoagulation method employs staining the conjunctival surface to increase the thermal laser energy absorbed by the target. This novel technique is simple and effective for treating mild-to-moderate-grade CCh in outpatient clinics.",

      "title": "A Rare Occurrence of Stargardt Disease in a Quadragenarian Adult.",
      "abstract": "The retina is the light-sensitive layer of the human eye. The macula forms the central part of the retina. The character of light responsiveness is attributed to the presence of photoreceptor cells here. Stargardt's disease is the most common cause of hereditary macular dystrophy. It is linked to disease-causing sequence variations/mutations in the ABCA4 gene on chromosome 1p21-p13, which destroys rod and cone cells within the retina. The disc membranes of rod and cone outer segments include an ATP-binding cassette transport protein encoded by the ABCA4 gene. All trans-retinal conjugates are transported across disc membranes by the ABCA4 protein. Abnormally high amounts of lipofuscin pigments build up in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) due to mutations in the ABCA4 gene, leading to RPE cell loss and secondary photoreceptor cell degeneration. As a result of this disease, the central or detailed vision becomes blurred, and the patient may find it challenging to discern colours. The retina presents with a distinctive \"beaten-bronze\" appearance due to the presence of prominent yellow dots. The phenotypic form of Stargardt disease, known as fundus flavimaculatus, is characterized by the widespread distribution of flecks throughout the fundus, including the periphery. In the given case report, we present a 46-year-old male patient who presented with complaints of persistence of a blind spot in central vision, difficulty in identifying faces, distortion of letters while reading, decreased visual acuity and difficulty in adapting from light to dark settings as symptoms. The stepwise assessment of the patient led to the diagnosis of Stargardt's disease. The case report reflects the disease history, pathogenesis, manifestations, prognosis, differential diagnosis and treatment options for this rare presentation.",

      "abstract": "Severe leaf spot on Polygonum cuspidatum was found in the planting base of P. cuspidatum in Fangxian county, Shiyan of Hubei province. To clarify the types of pathogens and their pathogenesis, the present study isolated and purified the pathogen of leaf spot disease of P. cuspidatum according to Koch's postulates, determined the pathogenicity of the pathogen, and investigated its biological characteristics. Meanwhile, the inhibitory effects of 11 types of fungicides on the bacteria were determined according to the mycelium growth rate, and suitable prevention and control drugs were selected. The results showed that the pathogen isolated from the diseased leaves of P. cuspidatum was Phoma rhei by morphological and molecular identification. The colony morphology and microscopic characteristics were the same as those of Ph. rhei. The homology of rDNA-ITS and TEF gene sequences with Ph. rhei reached 99.96% and 99.43%, respectively. The optimal growth temperature of Ph. rhei was 25 ℃, and the optimal pH was 7-10. Furthermore, Ph. rhei grew faster under dark or light conditions. In fungicides, 0.3% eugenol, 250 g·L~(-1) propiconazole, and 33.5% quinoline copper had significant inhibitory effects on the pathogen with EC_(50) values of 57.54, 59.58, 88.69 μg·mL~(-1), respectively. Eugenol is a botanical fungicide, which can be used as a green and environmentally friendly fungicide in the prevention and control of P. cuspidatum. This study reported for the first time that the pathogen of P. cuspidatum leaf spot was Ph. rhei. investigated the biological characteristics of the pathogen, and screened the indoor chemicals, which provided a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of P. cuspidatum leaf spot in production.",

      "abstract": "This is the case of chronic chromoblastomycosis (CBM) in a 61-year-old male from the Dominican Republic (DR) with extensive cutaneous eruptions over multiple areas of the body including bilateral lower extremities and the flank extending to the back. A 61-year-old male with a history of morbid obesity, chronic kidney disease stage III, and well-controlled hypertension presented to the family medicine clinic for the evaluation of chronic painful skin lesions on his legs and torso. The lesions began 19 years prior, following a flood in the Dominican Republic (DR) where he was living at the time. He described the initial lesion as a dark flat spot that never healed, despite various home remedies. It began on his distal lower left extremity and slowly became more nodular and spread over his entire lower left extremity. Over the years, he continued to develop more nodular lesions on both legs and his left flank. Physical exam revealed multiple hyperkeratotic fungating nodules and papules on the bilateral lower extremities as well as the left flank. Physical exam of the left lower extremity showed multiple hyperkeratotic fungating nodular skin lesions. No biopsies were done at that visit. Three weeks after his initial presentation, the patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of bloody discharge and \"maggots\" in his leg wounds. On physical exam, there was evidence of two infected pedunculated lesions with surrounding erythema and maggots coming out of the wound on the left lower extremity. Using scissors, one of the lesions was excised, resulting in complete removal of the maggots. The tissue was sent to pathology for assessment and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. Pathology report showed skin with marked papillary epidermal hyperplasia with prominent parakeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, granulation tissue, and extensive dermal acute inflammation with microabscesses. The larvae had a dense cuticle with viable internal organs and striated muscle. There was no evidence of malignancy, and AFB smear was negative. The patient was continued on Keflex and referred to infectious disease for further evaluation. Infectious disease started the patient on ivermectin 3mg four times a day due to the possibility of chronic larval migrans. A shave biopsy was performed by dermatology, and pathology showed marked papillary epidermal hyperplasia with parakeratosis and prominent pseudoepitheliomatous squamous hyperplasia. The dermis showed extensive chronic and focal acute inflammation with micro-abscesses and scattered multi-nucleated foreign body giant cells. Scattered within the pyogranulomatous inflammation in the dermis were singly and clusters of brown pigmented yeast forms, some engulfed by foreign body giant cells. Special stains (GMS and PAS-D) highlighted fungal organisms. These results in the context of extensive chronic lesions were compatible with chromoblastomycosis. Given this diagnosis, the decision was made to continue on itraconazole 200mg oral twice daily. Dermatology also began physical treatment with liquid nitrogen cryotherapy with topical Mupirocin ointment to be applied daily. This treatment is currently ongoing and shows significant decreases in severity of lesions as noted in decreased pain, significant flattening of the lesions. The patient is reassessed with repeat fungal cultures every six weeks.",

      "title": "Leaf spot disease caused by ",
      "abstract": "Mango (Mangifera indica L.), tropical fruit renowned for its rich flavor and nutritional benefits, is extensively cultivated in southern China (Wang et al. 2023). In July 2023, leaf spots were observed in a mango plantation located in Tianyang, Guangxi, China (106°22'-107°09'E, 23°29'-24°07'N), with ~20% incidence across surveyed fields. Affected leaves exhibited 20-80% necrotic coverage, with subcircular or irregular yellowish-brown lesions gradually expanding into brown irregular areas surrounded by yellow halos. Symptomatic leaves were collected from three orchards, and 5 × 5 mm sections were excised from lesion margins and surface sterilized by immersion in 75% ethanol for 15 s and 2% sodium hypochlorite for 1 min, followed by three sterile distilled water rinses. Disinfected tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28°C under 12-h photoperiod cycles for 5 days. A total of 75 morphologically similar isolates were obtained, and three representative strains (TY6-1, TY8-1, TY9-1) were selected for characterization. Colonies displayed dark green pigmentation with granular textures and irregular white margins. Conidiomata were black, immersed or semi-immersed, subglobose to ellipsoidal, solitary or aggregated on the stroma, with circular ostioles. Conidiogenous cells appeared stick-shaped with apical constrictions, producing hyaline, unicellular, ovoid or subglobose conidia (6.0-8.5 × 8.5-13.3 μm; n=90) bearing single apical appendages. Morphological characteristics of the three isolates aligned with descriptions of Phyllosticta spp. (Wikee et al. 2013). For molecular identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, actin (ACT), and translation elongation factor (TEF) genes were amplified and sequenced using primer pairs ITS-ITS1/ITS4, ACT-512F/783R, and TEF-728F/986R, respectively (White et al. 1990; Carbone et al. 1999). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers PV259393-PV259395 (ITS); PV268325-PV268327 (ACT); and PV268328-PV268330 (TEF). BLASTN analyses revealed that all sequences exhibited over 99% identity with sequences (accessions JF261465, JF343647, JF261507) of the type strain of P. capitalensis (CBS 128856). Maximum likelihood phylogeny (RAxML v8.2.10) of concatenated sequences placed all isolates within the P. capitalensis clade with strong bootstrap support. Pathogenicity assays were conducted on leaves of two-year-old mango plants in a greenhouse. Both wounded and intact leaves (20 leaves/plant, 3 plants/treatment) were inoculated with 20 μL of conidial suspension (10⁶ spores/mL), while controls received 0.05% Tween 80. Plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain high humidity. After 14 days, wounded and inoculated leaves developed lesions matching field observations, whereas control and unwounded leaves remained asymptomatic. The pathogenicity test was repeated three times with similar results. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-isolation of P. capitalensis from symptomatic tissues, confirmed through morphological and molecular congruence. Although P. capitalensis has been reported to cause leaf spot on Hymenocallis littoralis (Wu et al. 2024) and Rubus chingii (Zhang et al. 2022), to our knowledge this is the first report of mango leaf spot caused by P. capitalensis in China. This finding provides critical insights for developing targeted management strategies against emerging mango leaf spot epidemics.",

      "abstract": "This study investigated the efficacy and safety of Nd: YAG laser (1064 nm) hair removal in 55 Sudanese women with Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, and VI. The primary objective was to evaluate the influence of skin type, fluence, age, and geographic location on the number of treatments required to achieve satisfactory hair reduction in the chin area. Treatment parameters, including fluence (25-40 J/cm²), spot size (10-12 mm), and pulse width (20-40 ms), were tailored to individual characteristics using the Cynosure Elite + Nd: YAG laser with sapphire contact cooling. Outcomes were assessed using clinical evaluation, pre- and post-treatment photographs, and a standardized 5-point hair density scale. Statistical analysis revealed that fluence significantly impacted outcomes (p = 0.039), with 25 J/cm² demonstrating effectiveness. Skin type, age, and geographic location were not significant factors (p > 0.05). No topical bleaching cream was used, and many participants reported improvement in skin tone. No adverse events or paradoxical hypertrichosis were observed. The study supports the safe and effective use of low-fluence 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser treatment for hair removal in darker skin types. Future research should examine long-term outcomes and broader treatment sites.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia, a complex multisystem disorder predominantly impacting the kidneys and liver, manifests through hypertension and organ dysfunction in expectant mothers. Preeclampsia can also cause ocular signs, but they are uncommon. Exudative retinal detachment (ERD) is one such unusual but dangerous consequence. A thorough clinical description and therapy of a patient who experienced exudative retinal detachment while experiencing preeclampsia are provided in this study. A 28-year-old Saudi female, with no medical or surgical history, underwent an emergency cesarean section (CS) due to severe preeclampsia and failed induction of labor. The patient complained of painless blurry vision, with central dark spot and decreased vision starting from labor daytime. ﻿The patient was admitted to the hospital for blood pressure monitoring and further investigations. The patient was started on hydralazine intravenous (IV) and labetalol PO to control BP. ﻿The patient was delivered by cesarean section for preeclampsia with severe features after the failure of labor induction, and she had improved her vision by four weeks postpartum. Retinal detachment as a consequence of preeclampsia is conservatively managed, with a generally favorable prognosis. Previous studies have consistently emphasized the critical importance of a multidisciplinary approach that fosters collaboration between obstetricians and ophthalmologists. This collaborative strategy not only ensures comprehensive care but also facilitates early detection, timely intervention, and improved management outcomes for conditions affecting both maternal health and ophthalmic well-being during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Performing laser hair removal treatments on dark skin is limited by the quantity of melanin within the skin. To minimize side effects, lower values of fluence are selected when using standard 755 or 810 nm diode lasers. However, this approach may limit the effectiveness of the procedure, particularly when treating areas with thin and less pigmented hair, which is often the case in facial regions. To improve results, high-power triple wavelength diode lasers can be used. This study aims to assess the efficacy, safety, and comfort of treatments that remove facial hair with a high-power triple wavelength diode laser (810, 940, and 1060 nm) in static mode on Asian patients with thin and less pigmented hair.",

      "title": "Measuring anxiety-like behavior in a mouse model of mTBI: Assessment in standard and home cage assays.",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a primary global health concern and one of the most common causes of neurological impairments in people under 50. Mild TBI (mTBI) accounts for the majority of TBI cases. Anxiety is the most common complaint after mTBI in humans. This study aims to evaluate behavioral tests designed to assess anxiety-like phenotypes in a mice model of mTBI. ICR mice underwent mTBI using the weight-drop model. Seven days post-injury, mice were subjected to one of five different behavioral tests: Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Open Field apparatus (OF), Marble Burying test (MBT), Light Dark Box (LDB), and the Light Spot test within the PhenoTyper home cage (LS). In the EPM and OF tests, there were no significant differences between the groups. During the 30-min test period of the MBT, mTBI mice buried significantly more marbles than control mice. In the LDB, mTBI mice spent significantly less time on the far side of the arena than control mice. In addition, the time it took for mTBI mice to get to the far side of the arena was significantly longer compared to controls. Results of LS show significant within-group mean differences for total distance traveled for mTBI mice but not for the control. Furthermore, injured mice moved significantly more than control mice. According to the results, the anxiety traits exhibited by mTBI mice depend upon the time of exposure to the aversive stimulus, the apparatus, and the properties of the stressors used. Therefore, the characterization of anxiety-like behavior in mTBI mice is more complicated than was initially suggested. Based on our findings, we recommend incorporating a variety of stressors and test session lengths when assessing anxiety-like behavior in experimental models of mTBI.",

      "title": "Interfacial Modification of ZnO/ZnMgO Bilayer for Efficient and Stable InP Quantum Dot Light-Emitting Diodes via Ultraviolet Ozone Treatment.",
      "abstract": "The development of efficient charge transport layers is crucial for realizing high-performance and stable quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs). The use of a ZnO/ZnMgO bilayer as an electron transporting layer (ETL) has garnered considerable attention. This configuration leverages the high electron mobility of ZnO and the favorable surface state of ZnMgO. Furthermore, the versatility of this configuration extends to its wide range of thickness tunability, rendering it suitable for the construction of thick devices for top-emitting structures with microcavities. However, despite the promising attributes of this bilayer configuration, the impact of the ZnO/ZnMgO bilayer ETL interface on QD-LEDs performance remains largely unexplored. Thus, this study investigated the effect of ultraviolet ozone (UVO) treatment on the stabilization of the ZnO/ZnMgO interface. UVO treatment was found to significantly enhance luminance uniformity across the QD-LEDs emission area while improving operational stability by over 4-fold. Comprehensive analyses employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that UVO treatment significantly reduced the defect states of the hydroxyl groups and removed the insulating native ethanolamine ligands, thereby facilitating improved and uniform electron transport. Moreover, the effectiveness of UVO treatment in enhancing electron transport was supported by impedance analyses. Therefore, this paper presents an effective approach for enhancing the interface of a highly potent ZnO/ZnMgO bilayer ETL, which can ultimately improve the luminance uniformity and stability of QD-LEDs.",

In addition, scattered dark brown spots were observed within the area of diffuse discoloration. These lesions were significantly more pronounced on the Texture and Color Enhancement Imaging mode 1. These changes were not observed before the initiation of PPI therapy or in the antrum after PPI administration. Biopsy specimens from the discolored mucosa revealed lipofuscin granules in the cytoplasm of the parietal cells. These findings suggest that the discoloration was a result of the deposition of lipofuscin due to the action of PPI on parietal cells. To the best of our knowledge, these findings have not been previously reported and are distinct from those of black spots and gastric pseudomelanosis. We believe that these new findings offer valuable insights into gastric mucosal changes associated with PPI therapy.",

We present the case of a 62-year-old male patient with a presumed diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and severe pain and stiffness in his right hip. Plain radiographs revealed severe right hip osteoarthritis. The patient underwent total hip arthroplasty (THA) without any perioperative complications. The intraoperative findings (black ring-like spot at the femoral head and also at the cartilage and acetabulum) and a more detailed medical history taken postoperatively raised suspicions of alkaptonuria, which was confirmed with the specific exam for alkaptonuria (homogentisic acid levels evaluation in a 24 h urine sample). This report underscores the importance of a thorough medical history and clinical examination of these patients to avoid inaccurate diagnosis and administration of inappropriate therapeutic schemes.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging is characterized by changes in its structural, cellular, and molecular components in both the epidermis and dermis. Dermal aging is distinguished by reduced dermal thickness, increased wrinkles, and a sagging appearance. Due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors, accumulation of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers a series of aging events, including imbalanced extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis, accumulation of senescent fibroblasts, loss of cell identity, and chronic inflammation mediated by senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These events are regulated by signaling pathways, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Senescent fibroblasts can induce and accelerate age-related dysfunction of other skin cells and may even cause systemic inflammation. In this review, we summarize the role of dermal fibroblasts in cutaneous aging and inflammation. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms by which dermal fibroblasts influence cutaneous aging and inflammation are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "The skin is an endocrine organ and a major target of hormones such as estrogens, androgens and cortisol. Besides vasomotor symptoms (VMS), skin and hair symptoms often receive less attention than other menopausal symptoms despite having a significant negative effect on quality of life. Skin and mucosal menopausal symptoms include dryness and pruritus, thinning and atrophy, wrinkles and sagging, poor wound healing and reduced vascularity, whereas skin premalignant and malignant lesions and skin aging signs are almost exclusively caused by environmental factors, especially solar radiation. Hair menopausal symptoms include reduced hair growth and density on the scalp (diffuse effluvium due to follicular rarefication and/or androgenetic alopecia of female pattern), altered hair quality and structure, and increased unwanted hair growth on facial areas. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not indicated for skin and hair symptoms alone due to the risk-benefit balance, but wider potential benefits of HRT (beyond estrogen's effect on VMS, bone, breast, heart and blood vessels) to include skin, hair and mucosal benefits should be discussed with women so that they will be able to make the best possible informed decisions on how to prevent or manage their menopausal symptoms.",

      "title": "Implications of Ozempic and Other Semaglutide Medications for Facial Plastic Surgeons.",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a growing global health concern, leading to various health issues, including diabetes. Semaglutide-based medications, such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, have emerged as potential treatments. These medications, belonging to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist class, mimic the action of GLP-1, regulating appetite and promoting weight loss. Clinical trials have shown their effectiveness in reducing body weight and improving metabolic parameters. Ozempic, though Food and Drug Administration-approved for diabetes, is also used off-label for weight loss alone. Rapid weight and fat loss with Ozempic can lead to the characteristic \"Ozempic face,\" where facial volume and fat are depleted, resulting in wrinkles and sagging skin. Providers prescribing Ozempic seldom counsel patients about the potential impact on the face. As a result, the plastic surgery community faces a challenge in managing facial changes associated with rapid weight loss. Dermal fillers, skin tightening techniques, and surgical interventions are useful for both restoration of facial volume and to manage excess skin. Discontinuation of Ozempic should be considered prior to general anesthesia due to gastrointestinal side effects including delayed gastric emptying. As the popularity of Ozempic grows, facial plastic surgeons must be aware of both the impact on facial appearance and perioperative considerations.",

      "title": "The role of cellular senescence in skin aging and age-related skin pathologies.",
      "abstract": "Aging is the result of a gradual functional decline at the cellular, and ultimately, organismal level, resulting in an increased risk of developing a variety of chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. The skin is the largest organ of the human body, and the site where signs of aging are most visible. These signs include thin and dry skin, sagging, loss of elasticity, wrinkles, as well as aberrant pigmentation. The appearance of these features is accelerated by exposure to extrinsic factors such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation or pollution, as well as intrinsic factors including time, genetics, and hormonal changes. At the cellular level, aging is associated with impaired proteostasis and an accumulation of macromolecular damage, genomic instability, chromatin reorganization, telomere shortening, remodelling of the nuclear lamina, proliferation defects and premature senescence. Cellular senescence is a state of permanent growth arrest and a key hallmark of aging in many tissues. Due to their inability to proliferate, senescent cells no longer contribute to tissue repair or regeneration. Moreover, senescent cells impair tissue homeostasis, promote inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation by secreting molecules collectively known as the \"senescence-associated secretory phenotype\" (SASP). Senescence can be triggered by a number of different stimuli such as telomere shortening, oncogene expression, or persistent activation of DNA damage checkpoints. As a result, these cells accumulate in aging tissues, including human skin. In this review, we focus on the role of cellular senescence during skin aging and the development of age-related skin pathologies, and discuss potential strategies to rejuvenate aged skin.",

      "abstract": "Facial aesthetic procedures have become increasingly popular and complex, making knowledge of facial anatomy crucial for achieving desired outcomes without complications. Some of the most common procedures include blepharoplasty, bichectomy, face-lifts, facial implants, thread lifting, and fillers. Blepharoplasty and bichectomy are surgical procedures that respectively aim to restore youthful contours to the periorbita and create a slimmer lower face by removing Bichat fat from the maxillofacial region. Facial implants are used for aesthetic augmentation of the skeletal structure and restoration of facial contour by using biomaterials or autogenous bone grafts. Face-lift surgeries involve incisions and removal of excess skin, and thread lifts involve less invasive procedures performed by inserting threads beneath the skin, with the aim to lift the skin and thus reduce wrinkles and sagging. Fillers improve wrinkles and loss of facial volume, with biologic types made from animal, human, or bacterial sources (such as hyaluronic acid), while synthetic fillers include substances such as paraffin, silicone, calcium hydroxyapatite, polymethylmethacrylate microspheres, polyacrylamide hydrogel, hydroxyethyl-ethyl methacrylate, and poly-l-lactic acid. Synthetic fillers can be classified as rapidly resorbable (<12 months), slowly resorbable (<24 months), or permanent. Imaging modalities such as US, CT, and MRI can help identify and analyze each type of facial aesthetic procedure or filler, as well as their possible complications such as foreign-body granuloma, noninflammatory nodule, late intermittent persistent edema, filler migration, infection, or complications after removal of the buccal fat pad.

      "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA)-based injectables continue to grow in popularity and are used worldwide to improve facial changes associated with aging. Profhilo® Structura (IBSA Farmaceutici Italia, Lodi, Italy) is a novel HA-based product that uses nano hybrid complex of hyaluronic acid (NAHYCO)® technology to create hybrid cooperative complexes consisting of high and low molecular weight HA. Profhilo® Structura's high concentration (45 mg of total HA) and rheological properties (ie, viscosity [resistance to flow] and elasticity [stickiness]) have been specially formulated to restore facial adipose tissue. Because of their early involvement in the facial aging process, the superficial medial and lateral-temporal cheek fat compartments are good candidates for treatment. However, recommendations and guidelines are necessary to ensure that treatment is safe and effective. Three experts were invited to IBSA Farmaceutici Italia Srl to discuss clinical rationale, optimal injection techniques, and clinical outcomes for treating the superficial medial and lateral-temporal cheek fat compartments with Profhilo® Structura. These techniques were developed using patients presenting with either initial hypotrophy of fat compartments within the preauricular area (ie, sinkers) or jowl sagging due to hypotrophy within the preauricular and zygomatic areas (ie, saggers). Targeting these areas using the optimal injection site can maximize product diffusion and minimize the risk for vascular compromise. Targeting these areas also leads to lateral tightening and lipolifting effects due to adipose tissue restoration. The experts agreed that Profhilo® Structura is currently the first and only HA-based injectable treatment that can integrate and restore the adipose tissue in these affected fat compartments.",

      "abstract": "The demand for non-invasive skin-tightening techniques is continuously on the rise, as now numerous patients seek safe and effective alternative body, neck, and facial aesthetic surgical procedures. Micro-focused ultrasound (MFU) has been recently introduced as a novel energy modality for skin rejuvenation to produce a more significant wound healing response at various levels, including strong collagen remodeling and long-lasting clinical response. This literature study was intended to find the role and efficiency of using micro-focused ultrasound therapy in male and female patients aged 35-65. A total of 139 articles were extracted from the PubMed and Science Direct electronic databases. After a thorough evaluation and following the exclusion and inclusion criteria, 10 full-text articles were relevant to the study. The goal was to analyze and examine the effects and benefits of MFU treatment to improve the skin. In addition, all of the patients were evaluated to report the harms and risks associated with MFU treatment. The literature study results revealed that significant improvements in the overall aesthetics of sagging of the mid and lower face could be accomplished by using a micro-focused ultrasonic treatment plan. Patients report no considerable side effects, and the results were also long-lasting. MFU treatment can activate deeper tissues without causing injury to the epidermis, which sets it apart from all other skin tightening methods. Better improvements rates have been reported by both patients' self-assessment and clinical investigators' evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Non-facial (body) rejuvenation is a treatment of increasing demand, with patients seeking to harmonize the benefits of rejuvenated facial appearance with other areas of the body. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)-SCA (Sculptra®) has been approved for facial aesthetic uses since 1999 in Europe and since 2009 in the USA and more recently evaluated for the treatment of cellulite of the buttocks and thighs and other body indications. The current evidence base consists largely of prospective observational analyses and case series although systematic evaluations for a number of body areas are underway. Current data support a potential benefit for the use of PLLA-SCA for the aesthetic treatment of the neck, knees, abdomen, hands and upper arms. Improvements in aesthetic appearance (e.g. sagging, wrinkling, dimpling, cellulite) that are sustained over time with minimal side effects can be achieved. Standardization of injection protocols for different body areas is now needed along with the validation of clinical tools that can be used to agree on treatment goals and to evaluate aesthetic improvements over time. A group of international experts in the fields of facial and body aesthetics, plastic surgery and dermatology were selected based on their educational, scientific and publication merits together with clinical experience using PLLA-SCA for body rejuvenation. Here, we provide an evidence-based and expert-led consensus (14 years of off-face treatment experience) on recommendations for appropriate injection protocols for different body sites and evaluation tools when using the biostimulator PLLA-SCA for body aesthetic and rejuvenation procedures.Level of Evidence IV This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

      "title": "Why do marionette lines appear? Exploring the anatomical perspectives and role of thread-based interventions.",
      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of marionette lines involves a complex interplay of anatomical, physiological, and age-related factors leading to the development of wrinkles around the oral commissures. This exploration delves into the distinct anatomical predispositions observed among different ethnicities, emphasizing the role of compact modiolus structures and muscle compositions. Notably, individuals of East Asian descent exhibit inherent facial structures that predispose them to pronounced sagging around the oral commissures during aging. The emergence of distinct facial lines, such as the commissural line and the melolabial fold, contributes to the formation of marionette lines. This specific wrinkle pattern, resembling a marionette puppet's mouth contours, is influenced by various factors like bone resorption, gravitational forces, fat compartment variations, muscle compression, ligament tethering, and skin aging. Treatment strategies for marionette lines encompass diverse interventions, including filler injections, botulinum neurotoxin, surgeries targeting fat reduction, thread lifting, and volumizing fillers. These approaches aim to address the underlying causes and mitigate the appearance of marionette lines. Botulinum neurotoxin injections, for instance, weaken specific facial muscles, reducing downward strain and aiding in tissue retraction. Anatomical considerations during procedures are crucial to avoid nerve or vascular damage. Delicate manipulation and precise entry points are essential to prevent inadvertent injuries, particularly concerning blood vessels like the facial artery and nerves like the mental nerve. Technical guidelines for procedures targeting marionette lines involve specific techniques like cogged thread reverse methods and volumizing thread placements. Attention to entry points, tissue engagement, and the direction of threads is crucial for effective treatment outcomes, minimizing complications, and ensuring patient safety.",

      "title": "Combined dasatinib and quercetin treatment contributes to skin rejuvenation through selective elimination of senescent cells in vitro and in vivo.",
      "abstract": "The skin's protective functions are compromised over time by both endogenous and exogenous aging. Senescence is well-documented in skin phenotypes, such as wrinkling and sagging, a consequence of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that involves the accumulation of senescent fibroblasts, chronic inflammation, and collagen remodeling. Although therapeutic approaches for eliminating senescent cells from the skin are available, their efficacy remains unclear. Accordingly, we aimed to examine the effects of dasatinib in combination with quercetin (D + Q) on senescent human skin fibroblasts and aging human skin. Senescence was induced in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) using approaches such as long-term passaging, ionizing radiation, and doxorubicin treatment. The generated senescent cells were treated with D + Q or vehicle. Additionally, a mouse-human chimera model was generated by subcutaneously transplanting whole-skin grafts of aged individuals onto nude mice. Mouse models were administered D + Q or vehicle by oral gavage for 30 days. Subsequently, skin samples were harvested and stained for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. Senescence-associated markers were assessed by western blotting, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and histological analyses. Herein, D + Q selectively eliminated senescent HDFs in all cellular models of induced senescence. Additionally, D + Q-treated aged human skin grafts exhibited increased collagen density and suppression of the SASP compared with control grafts. No adverse events were observed during the study period. Collectively, D + Q could ameliorate skin aging through selective elimination of senescent dermal fibroblasts and suppression of the SASP. Our findings suggest that D + Q could be developed as an effective therapeutic approach for combating skin aging.",

      "abstract": "High-Intensity Microfocused Ultrasound (HIFU) applies the high energy of focused ultrasound (US) to penetrate deeply into skin tissue. Despite significant investments in this technology and positive reports from clinical practitioners, scientific discussions reveal substantial controversy regarding its effects. This study aimed to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the evidence on HIFU's effectiveness in improving skin sagging across short, medium, and long-term outcomes, along with its potential adverse effects. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Library. Out of One hundred and eighteen articles identified after duplicate removal, 99 studies underwent eligibility evaluation, resulting in the selection of 12 articles, including three randomized and nine non-randomized studies. Two randomized studies qualified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The review indicates that high-intensity microfocused ultrasound shows promising results in improving skin sagging, with a total of 475 participants evaluated (333 women and 142 men). The meta-analysis of two studies on neck skin sagging improvement showed no significant difference between HIFU and RF groups across short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes (CI: 0.19 [-0.84, 0.45]; -0.5 [-0.65, 0.55]; -0.45 [-0.99, 0.09]). Although HIFU therapy appears beneficial for skin sagging, further high-quality, standardized studies are required to confirm these findings and reduce methodological biases.",

      "abstract": "Gradually, loss of skin elasticity and elastic properties occurs after 30 years of age and will be associated with several changes, including creating wrinkles, skin laxity (sagging skin), and skin blemishes. In general, people all over the world are looking for ways to keep their facial skin young over time. There are several strategies to skin rejuvenate, including invasive and non-invasive methods. However, invasive methods have less popularity than non-invasive methods due to their need for specialist physicians (medical expertise), localized neuropathic pains for patients, the prevalence and incidence of skin infections, and high-cost clinical services. In the meantime, skin hydration is one of the simplest non-invasive methods for skin rejuvenation, and HA, with anti-aging and skin collagen-stimulating properties, has been introduced as a natural skin moisturizing agent. Therefore, since this composition maintains facial skin moisture and radiance, and improves its elasticity, it has always been considered by experts and specialist physicians. On the other hand, due to its lipophilic properties, hydrophilic macromolecules containing HA cannot pass through the stratum corneum. However, they have temporary and superficial softening effects on the skin. Hence, some nanocarriers have been suggested to overcome this problem and develop the properties and positive influences of HA on skin rejuvenation. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce some new non-invasive approaches in facial skin rejuvenation, including applying liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, and ionic liquids, to transport HA into the inner and deeper layers of the skin, including Dermis. In this review article, we examine non-invasive methods using nanoparticles to deliver HA to the epidermis and dermis of the skin for skin rejuvenation.",

      "abstract": "Skin ageing is a complex physiological process primarily characterised by the deepening of wrinkles and the sagging of the skin. Collagen is essential for maintaining skin elasticity and firmness. As skin ages, it experiences structural and functional changes in collagen, including a decrease in collagen synthesis and an increase in collagen hydrolysis. Thus, promoting collagen synthesis represents a practical strategy for mitigating skin ageing. This review systematically described the functions, classifications and biosynthesis process of collagen, as well as its role in skin ageing. Additionally, the major signalling pathways and targets associated with collagen synthesis were also discussed. More importantly, the review provided a detailed summary of natural products with collagen synthesis-promoting effects and highlighted small molecule compounds with potential anti-ageing activity, especially PPARδ agonists. The relevant content offers potential targets and lead compounds for the development of anti-skin ageing therapies.",

The aim of the use of RF is to vaporize and coagulate tissue through a tissue temperature of >70 °C and to achieve a temperature of 42-44 °C especially in deeper layers, in order to promote a thermally induced collagen regeneration that enables skin tightening over the dermis. Unipolar, monopolar, bipolar, multipolar and fractional RF are suitable for medical applications. The result to be expected cannot compete with surgical lifting but RF is effective in cases of moderately sagging skin.",

In the lower face, this results in sagging of the soft tissue leading to the formation of jowling, loss of an attractive well-defined jaw line, and a retruded chin. Both surgical and non-surgical options are available to reverse the aging signs; however, the popularity of non-surgical treatment has dramatically increased in last 2 decades.",

A systematic literature search was performed in electronic databases until 15th February 2022. Four cohort studies including 129 patients from 3 countries were included between time period 2011 and 2020. Overall, bariatric surgery would promote massive weight loss associated with positive effects on facial aging. Analysis revealed a proportional relationship between body mass index (BMI) and faster facial aging and more attractive. Undergoing bariatric surgery would result in facial skin sagging and a favorable effect on the upper airway. Bariatric surgery was found to have a significant impact on changes in facial features but the current evidence remains inconclusive and further studies are required to illustrate facial changes post-bariatric surgery.",

      "abstract": "Photodamage is caused by chronic sun exposure and ultraviolet radiation and presents as wrinkles, sagging, and pigmented spots. An increase in the ultraviolet index can increase a person's perceived age by worsening skin photodamage. However, since the ultraviolet index varies considerably between geographical regions, perceived age might vary substantially among them. This review aims to describe the differences in chronological and perceived age in regions of the world with different ultraviolet indexes. A literature search of three databases was conducted for studies analyzing perceived age and its relationship to sun exposure. Ultraviolet indexes from the included studies were retrieved from the National Weather Service and the Tropospheric Emission Monitoring Internet Service. Out of 104 studies, seven fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Overall, 3,352 patients were evaluated for perceived age. All studies found that patients with the highest daily sun exposures had the highest perceived ages for their chronological age ( ",

Here, a cosmetically effective face-fit surface-lighting µLED mask for skin anti-aging is introduced. The face-conformable mask enables deep tissue treatment through proximal light irradiation, with a 3D origami structure capable of adapting to complex facial contours with closed adherence. A blister-assisted laser transfer achieves rapid and accurate µLEDs transfer at a high throughput of 50 chips per second, facilitating a mass-producible and large-area process. Finally, clinical trials demonstrate significant improvements in elasticity, sagging, and wrinkles across six facial areas, with a maximum enhancement of 340% in deep skin elasticity of the perioral area compared to the conventional LED mask group.",

      "abstract": "In Japan, the growing interest in anti-aging skin care is associated with the unprecedented aging society. Skin aging can be attributed to various factors, including the activation of hyaluronidase enzyme in subcutaneous tissues exposed to ultraviolet radiation. This enzyme breaks down hyaluronic acid, leading to skin sagging. Therefore, hyaluronidase inhibitors can effectively prevent skin aging. Previously, food components have been actively explored to search for hyaluronidase inhibitors considering the high safety of these materials. Although lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-fermented foods inhibit this enzyme, their active compounds responsible for hyaluronidase inhibition remain unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to explore the mechanism underlying the LAB-mediated inhibition of hyaluronidase activity. Supernatants of a LAB-fermented milk-based beverage were subjected to a hyaluronidase inhibition assay, followed by purification and separation using hydrophobic adsorbents and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Subsequently, liquid chromatograph time-of-flight mass analysis was performed, revealing α-ketoglutarate (AKG) as the inhibitor of this enzyme. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC",

      "abstract": "Sagging of the periumbilical skin, also known as the \"sad umbilicus,\" is one of the most common postoperative complications in liposuction. It is characterized by an increase in the width and decrease in the height of the umbilicus. Technological advances in power-assisted liposuction resulting in skin tightening have been central to improvements in the treatment of sagging skin. Laser-assisted liposuction is a procedure in which a laser fiber induces lipolysis and skin tightening. Laser treatment delivered using a 980-nm diode laser may result in up to 30% skin surface area contraction. The aim of this study was to describe a new technique called the \"happy protocol\" for the treatment and prevention of the sad umbilicus. The periumbilical region is treated using a 980-nm diode laser set to an output power of 20 W, with a total delivered energy of 5000 J. The developed technique may be applied to correct shape distortions or to create a natural-looking and aesthetically pleasant umbilicus during liposuction. A decrease in the width of the umbilicus followed by an increase in height are observed in the first postoperative days. Patients who were followed up for 7 months postoperatively showed positive aesthetic results. The final outcome was an oval-shaped umbilicus, with increased height and reduced sagging in the periumbilical region.",

This is a case series study with five volunteers who received a single application of capacitive RF (BTL-6000 TR-Therapy Pro®) in the right infraumbilical abdominal region, with epidermal temperature above 40°C, for 10 min (2 min per applicator area), and the skin of the contralateral region was used as control. After 30 days, on average, the skin of the abdominal region was collected for histological analysis and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Picro-sirus, and Verhoff. The percentage of collagen and elastic fibers found was marked by the Image J®. The statistical analysis was performed in the SPSS program (version 20), with a significance level of 95%. This was registered with the ethics and research comitee of UFTM n 3.461.688 on Jul 12, 2019 and clinical trial registration n. NCT04182542, retrospectively registered. Morphometric analysis demonstrated a remodeling of collagen and elastic fibers on the side treated with RF; however, the morphometry for collagen showed no significant difference, with an average percentage of 60.94 ± 0.32 for the control side and 61.97 ± 2.80 for the treated with p=0.32. Similarly, elastic fibers also showed no significant difference between groups, with a mean percentage of 5.67 ± 2.70 for control and 6.21 ± 2.01 for treated with p=0.19. The RF with the parameters used in this study was able to cause morphological changes in collagen and elastic fibers of the abdominal region skin; however, it showed no change in the percentage of these fibers.",

Recent studies have shown that intestinal microbiota homeostasis can influence skin health, demonstrating the existence of a gut-skin axis. Recently, improving skin health through probiotic interventions has been proposed, and micro-ecological skin care is becoming a popular concept. By regulating skin health and gut-skin axis interactions, probiotics can be used as potential management tools to suppress and improve skin diseases in multiple ways, including decreasing oxidative stress, suppressing inflammatory responses, and keeping immune effects. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the application and mechanisms of probiotic-mediated gut microbiota homeostasis in skin care and to offer a theoretical basis for the application of probiotics in skin care.",

      "title": "Peripheral itch sensitization in atopic dermatitis.",
      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis is a skin disorder caused by skin dryness and barrier dysfunction, resulting in skin inflammation and chronic itch (or pruritus). The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is thought to be initiated by a lowering of the itch threshold due to dry skin. This lowering of the itch threshold is at least partially due to the increase in intraepidermal nerve fibers and sensitization of sensory nerves by interleukin (IL)-33 produced and secreted by keratinocytes. Such skin is easily prone to itch due to mechanical stimuli, such as rubbing of clothing and chemical stimuli from itch mediators. In patients with atopic dermatitis, once itch occurs, further itch is induced by scratching, and the associated scratching breaks down the skin barrier. Disruption of the skin barrier allows entry into the epidermis of external foreign substances, such as allergens derived from house dust mites, leading to an increased induction of type 2 inflammatory responses. As a result, type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31 are mainly secreted by Th2 cells, and their action on sensory nerve fibers causes further itch sensitization. These sequences of events are thought to occur simultaneously in patients with atopic dermatitis, leading to a vicious itch-scratch cycle. This vicious cycle becomes a negative spiral that leads to disease burden. Therefore, controlling itch is essential for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. In this review, we summarize and discuss advances in the mechanisms of peripheral itch sensitization in atopic dermatitis, focusing on skin barrier-neuro-immune triadic connectivity.",

This article aims to provide advice and guidance on which products to recommend according to a patient's skin condition. Appropriate application of a moisturizer attempts not only to improve the dryness, but also improve the skin's natural barrier function to protect the skin from internal and external irritants to keep the skin healthy. Moisturizers consist of various ingredients, including occlusive agents, emollients, humectants, lipid mixture, emulsifiers, and preservatives. Pathophysiology of dry skin is also discussed to provide readers with the background they need to choose the right moisturizer for themselves. As moisturizers play an important role as adjuvant in the treatment of common skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, psoriasis, acne and rosacea, which type of moisturizer is appropriate for each disease was also dealt with. Basic cosmetics, especially moisturizers, should be recommended in consideration of the ingredients, effectiveness and safety of each product, and the skin condition of each patient.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging is a complex process involving structural and functional changes and is characterized by a decrease in collagen content, reduced skin thickness, dryness, and the formation of wrinkles. This process is underpinned by multiple mechanisms including the free radical theory, inflammation theory, photoaging theory, and metabolic theory. The skin immune system, an indispensable part of the body's defense mechanism, comprises macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and mast cells. These cells play a pivotal role in maintaining skin homeostasis and responding to injury or infection. As age advances, along with various internal and external environmental stimuli, skin immune cells may undergo senescence or accelerated aging, characterized by reduced cell division capability, increased mortality, changes in gene expression patterns and signaling pathways, and altered immune cell functions. These changes collectively impact the overall function of the immune system. This review summarizes the relationship between skin aging and immunity and explores the characteristics of skin aging, the composition and function of the skin immune system, the aging of immune cells, and the effects of these cells on immune function and skin aging. Immune dysfunction plays a significant role in skin aging, suggesting that immunoregulation may become one of the important strategies for the prevention and treatment of skin aging.",

      "title": "Menopause and the Skin: Old Favorites and New Innovations in Cosmeceuticals for Estrogen-Deficient Skin.",
      "abstract": "Estrogen is a pivotal signaling molecule; its production is regulated by the expression of the aromatase (CYP19A1) gene from ovarian and peripheral tissue sites, and it is transmitted via estrogen receptors to influence many important biological functions. However, the narrative for this overview focuses on the decline of 17β-estradiol levels from ovarian sites after menopause. This estrogen-deficient condition is associated with a dramatic reduction in skin health and wellness by negatively impacting dermal cellular and homeostatic mechanisms, as well as other important biological functions. The changes include loss of collagen, elastin, fibroblast function, vascularity, and increased matrix metalloproteinase(s) enzymatic activities, resulting in cellular and extracellular degradation that leads to dryness, wrinkles, atrophy, impaired wound healing/barrier function, decreased antioxidant capacity [i.e., defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress], decreased attractiveness and psychological health, and increased perception of aging. While topical estrogen may reverse these changes, the effects of today's low-dose systemic hormone treatments are not well established, raising the need for more concentrated local administration of hormones or newer cosmeceutical agents such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), including phytoestrogens that have become major active ingredients for skin care products, especially when addressing estrogen-deficient skin. Two example compounds are presented, an analog of resveratrol (i.e., 4'-acetoxy resveratrol) and the isoflavonoid equol, both of which are involved in a variety of biochemical/molecular actions and mechanisms, as demonstrated via in vitro and clinical studies that enhance human dermal health, especially in estrogen-deficient skin.",

      "abstract": "Barrier damage caused by facial acne vulgaris can be magnified by topical medication, such as adapalene (0.3%) and benzoyl peroxide (2.5%)(A/BPO), which utilizes a retinoid to normalize follicular keratinization and BPO to decrease the C. acnes population. Disease-induced irritation combined with topical medication-induced irritation results in dryness and enhanced inflammation leading to lower compliance and increased skin healing time. Ceramide-based moisturizers have documented barrier repair benefits for eczema but have not been studied for acne. The objective of this double-blind study was to measure the impact of acne treatment on skin barrier function and tolerance when paired with a ceramide routine. Participants were prescribed an A/BPO gel once daily. The treatment group received a ceramide-containing foaming facial cleanser and facial lotion, and the control group received basic foaming face wash for twice-daily use. Participant and investigator tolerability and efficacy were evaluated by both ordinal and clinical measures. Acne lesion counts and Investigator&rsquo;s Global Assessments (IGA) of acne were obtained along with transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements for barrier function. TEWL for the treatment group remained significantly lower than the control at all timepoints and significantly improved from baseline by week 12. The treatment group had statistically lower mean investigator scores for dryness at all timepoints. Inflammatory lesion counts were significantly lower for the treatment group. A/BPO damaged the skin barrier, demonstrated by elevated TEWL, contributing to dryness, redness, and scaling. Use of a ceramide-containing cleanser and moisturizer significantly reduced severity and incidence of dryness, erythema, and scaling while more quickly resolving barrier damage and restoring function.

      "abstract": "Eczema (atopic dermatitis; AD) is a very common itchy skin condition affecting 1 in 5 children and up to 1 in 10 adults worldwide. The skin of eczema sufferers is prone to redness, irritation and dryness because it does not form an effective barrier, i.e. the ability of the skin to stop irritants, allergens and microorganisms getting into the body. Skin barrier dysfunction is a hallmark of AD. The regular and liberal (600 g/week for an adult) use of emollients is recommended for all patients with eczema), even between episodes of itching and redness, to soften and soothe the skin. In England alone, almost 9 million prescriptions for emollient creams were issued in 2018, at a cost of over £50 million. Despite this widespread use, relatively little is known about how commonly prescribed emollient creams affect the skin's barrier, and thus the role of moisturizers in AD development and progression remains unclear. We set out to compare three different types of emollient cream and a no-treatment control.",

      "title": "Ichthyosis vulgaris: An updated review.",
      "abstract": "Ichthyosis vulgaris is an inherited, non-syndromic form of ichthyosis that presents with skin problems. Making up more than 95% cases of ichthyosis, ichthyosis vulgaris is caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutation of the filaggrin gene, raising the fragility and permeability of the stratum corneum. It typically presents in infancy as xerosis, skin lesions, keratosis pilaris, palmoplantar hyper linearity, scaly dermatosis, and erythroderma, clearly identifiable by age 5. Although majority of patients have a normal lifespan, possible complications include a vitamin D deficiency and auditory problems due to scaling in the ears, besides a drop in quality of life due to dermatological changes. Urea-based creams with 10% urea, ceramides, and other ceramides are often the first line therapy in ichthyosis vulgaris. There is no known curative treatment for ichthyosis vulgaris, but lifelong treatment can alleviate the symptoms. Urea-based creams are highly therapeutic, whereas ammonium lactate 12% lotion with a physiological lipid-based repair cream can help with scaling and dryness. There is also evidence in favour of propylene glycol solutions. Risankizumab, an anti-interleukin-23 drug, and enhancement of natural moisturizing factors are also two highly promising solutions that require additional research. This review aims to provide updates on the manifestation, evaluation, and treatment of ichthyosis vulgaris.",

      "title": "Emerging lasers and light-based therapies in the management of acne: a review.",
      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris, commonly known as acne, is the most prevalent skin disorder affecting mainly adolescents and young adults, though it can affect people of all ages, making it the most common complaint by patients presenting to a dermatologist. The overactivity of sebaceous glands primarily drives this skin condition due to androgen influence and the presence of Cutibacterium acnes bacteria. Although typically not directly harmful to patient health, acne can be a highly debilitating disease for patients, affecting their self-image and psychosocial well-being. Standard treatments include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics, and, for more severe cases, systemic antibiotics or isotretinoin, which require prolonged periods of compliance. All these pharmacologic treatments have a risk of side effects ranging from mild ones, like skin irritation and dryness, to severe ones, like depression. Thus, there is a demand for exploring other treatment modalities in treating acne, and laser and light-based therapies have garnered significant interest. This review article will comprehensively assess emerging laser and other light-based therapies that have shown efficacy in treating acne, including the recently FDA-approved 1,726 nm laser.",

It is the second most common type of ichthyosis, with a prevalence of 1/6,000 to 1/2,000 in males and without any racial or geographical differences. The causative gene for XLI is the steroid sulfatase gene (STS), located on Xp22.3. STS deficiency causes an abnormal cholesterol sulfate (CS) accumulation in the stratum corneum (SC). Excess CS induces epidermal permeability barrier dysfunction and scaling abnormalities. This review summarizes XLI's genetic, clinical, and pathological features, pathogenesis, diagnosis and differential diagnoses, and therapeutic perspectives. Further understanding the role of the STS gene pathogenic variants in XLI may contribute to a more accurate and efficient clinical diagnosis of XLI and provide novel strategies for its treatment and prenatal diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Dermatitis, the incendiary reaction of the skin to various components, can manifest in various types, including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, nummular eczema, seborrhoea, and stasis dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is the most common skin disease in children and has a growing prevalence in recent years. It is characterized by extreme tingling, eczemous skin injuries, dryness of the skin, and a family history of atopic illnesses. Contact dermatitis (CD) is a common, irritating skin disorder caused by allergens and aggravating elements in the environment. It is the most common cause of work-related dermatitis and plays a substantial role in hand and face dermatitis. A complete restorative history is essential for establishing CD and identifying the allergies that cause it. Fix testing, skin tests for fast contact reactions, serum allergen-specific IgE testing, subjective and quantitative evaluation of allergens inside probable items patients were exposed to, and challenge testing are among the other diagnostic techniques. To avoid a breakdown and the continuation of the skin illness, early and suitable therapy is critical. Allergic dermatitis to contact (ACD) develops during the normal, delayed incendiary reaction and has a perplexing etiology. Accurate identification of the allergen that is causing the reaction allows for adequate individual avoidance. The major treatment alternatives continue to be corticosteroids. Nickel-contact dermatitis is an allergic reaction that affects both children and adults. Adverse contact dermatitis (ACD) is a frequent skin reaction to a common allergen that can affect both children and adults. Less than 10% of all diagnostic procedures in pediatric patients involve checking for ACD symptoms. To answer the clinical question, a thorough history is gathered based on appearance, age group, and dermatitis type. According to pediatricians in the US, metals, perfumes, topical antimicrobials, excessive chemicals, and fabric softeners are the most typical allergens.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-related disease that affects people worldwide and is especially prevalent in the elderly. Many elderly people with diabetes also complain of dry skin; however, the relationship between aging and dry skin in type 2 diabetes is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the interaction between aging and dry skin using the specific pathogen-free KK-Ay/TaJcl type 2 diabetes mouse model. Skin dryness in this model increases with age and was evaluated at 10, 27, 40, and 50 weeks. We observed increased mast cell expression, increased histamine and matrix metalloproteinase-1 levels, and decreased collagen expression in the skin of aging KK-Ay/TaJcl mice. In addition, the increased expression of angiopoietin 2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and endostatin in the blood indicated kidney damage in this model. Aging KK-Ay/TaJcl mice also showed fatty liver pathology, which led to increased reactive oxygen species in the blood and liver, as well as the increased expression of M1 macrophages in the liver. These results showed that dry skin is associated with skin, kidney, and liver interactions in an aging type 2 diabetes mouse model.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Itch in Atopic Dermatitis.",
      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease characterized by recurrent eczematous lesions and intense itch. The pathological mechanism of AD involves a complex interaction between skin barrier dysfunction and a predominantly T helper (Th) 2-skewed immune dysregulation. The dysfunctional skin barrier in AD enhances antigen penetration, exacerbating allergic reactions. Scratching further damages the skin barrier, worsens dryness and increases the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, perpetuating the itch-scratch cycle. Breaking this cycle with appropriate treatments is vital. Th2 cells secrete interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-31 which play keys roles in AD pathogenesis. IL-31 directly induces pruritus, while IL-4 and IL-13 enhance itching. An increased density of intraepidermal nerve fibers has been observed in AD lesions in a disease-state-dependent manner. In normal skin, both semaphorin 3A (Sema3A; a nerve repulsion factor) and nerve growth factor (NGF; a nerve elongation factor) are expressed. However, in AD lesions, Sema3A expression decreases while NGF expression increases. These findings suggest that epidermal nerve density is regulated by a fine balance between Sema3A and NGF, with Sema3A playing a key role in itch sensitivity in AD. In healthy skin, Sema3A is produced during the early-stage of differentiation of keratinocytes and moves into the upper epidermis. The levels of Sema3A and the density of epidermal nerve fibers may vary depending on the disease state of AD. Our future research will focus on the regulatory mechanisms of Sema3A in skin, and potential clinical applications.",

      "title": "Exploring the Complexities of Atopic Dermatitis: Pathophysiological Mechanisms and Therapeutic Approaches.",
      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent inflammatory skin condition impacting both children and adults globally, with a prevalence of 15-30%. It ranks as the most prevalent skin disorder based on disability-adjusted life-years by the World Health Organization. It presents with symptoms like skin irritation, redness, dryness, itchiness, and vesicular blisters and commonly coexists with other atopic symptoms like allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies. The pathophysiology involves a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, immunological dysfunctions, and environmental factors leading to tissue inflammation and disrupted skin barrier integrity. Alopecia areata is characterized by nonscarring hair loss and shares correlations with AD including a higher prevalence of atopic diseases, shared intracellular mechanisms involving the JAK-STAT pathway, and potential treatment overlap such as dupilumab. These correlations could direct new areas of research and increased insight for both diseases. Treatment of AD requires a personalized approach due to its complex, multifactorial nature integrating nonpharmacological interventions like skin hydration and trigger avoidance as well as topical and systemic approaches, if necessary, with topical corticosteroids being the first line for flares; long term corticosteroid use poses risk for adverse effects like skin atrophy. Severe cases may require systemic treatments or phototherapy. Future treatment prospects include targeting the dysbiotic microbiome and identifying biomarkers for tailored therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the importance of personalized medicine in optimizing AD management.",

      "abstract": "Sjögren's disease (SD), also known as Sjögren's syndrome (SS) or Gougerot-Sjögren's syndrome in France, is a rare systemic autoimmune disease in its primary form and is characterised by tropism for the exocrine glandular epithelia, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands. The lymphocytic infiltration of these epithelia will clinically translate into a dry syndrome which, associated with fatigue and pain, constitutes the symptom triad of the disease. In about one third of patients, SD is associated with systemic complications that can affect the joints, skin, lungs, kidneys, central or peripheral nervous system, and lymphoid organs with an increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. SD affects women more frequently than men (9/1). The peak frequency is around the age of 50. However, the disease can occur at any age, with paediatric forms occurring even though they remain rare. SD can occur alone or in association with other systemic autoimmune diseases. In its isolated or primary form, the prevalence of SD is estimated to be between 1 per 1000 and 1 per 10,000 inhabitants. The most recent classification criteria were developed in 2016 by EULAR and ACR. The course and prognosis of the disease are highly variable and depend on the presence of systemic involvement and the severity of the dryness of the eyes and mouth. The current approach is therefore to identify at an early stage those patients most at risk of systemic complications or lymphoma, who require close follow-up. On the other hand, regular monitoring of the ophthalmological damage and of the dental status should be ensured to reduce the consequences.",

It is highly heterogeneous, and its management is demanding. Patients with AD are at greater risk of comorbidities such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as other atopic diseases. Early-onset AD cases typically improve or resolve in late childhood; however, it is proposed that the prevalence of persistent or adult-onset AD is higher than previously thought. Basic therapy consists of emollient application and trigger avoidance, and when insufficient, topical corticosteroids (TCS) are the first-line treatment. However, corticophobia/steroid aversion and TCS side-effects, particularly on sensitive skin areas, lead to low compliance and insufficient disease control. Several long- and short-term randomized controlled and daily practice studies have demonstrated that topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as pimecrolimus, have similar anti-inflammatory effects to low-to-medium strength TCS, reduce pruritus and improve the quality of life of patients. In addition, pimecrolimus does not cause skin atrophy, is steroid-sparing and has a good safety profile, with no evidence for an increased risk of malignancies or skin infections. In general, pimecrolimus cream is well-accepted and well-tolerated, encouraging patient adherence and leading to its use by many physicians as a preferred therapy for children and sensitive skin areas.",

      "abstract": "Sensitive skin exposed to external insults (i.e., allergens, chemicals, and radiation) becomes erythematosus, and with repeated aggravations may become chronically dry. This is often observed in atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, two skin conditions that display key pathogenic components: barrier dysfunction, skewed inflammatory immune response, and pruritus. Recent studies have evidenced that oxidative stress is a possible fourth component of the pathogenesis of sensitive skin. In patients with persistent disease, new agents and combination therapies that target oxidative stress along with other hallmarks of dry and sensitive skin have depicted positive effects on clinical outcomes in infants with dry and sensitive skin. In this paper, we reviewed clinical registration studies of products that have been observed to reduce skin dryness with cosmetically acceptable effects. Overall, similar approaches may be explored to improve the management of dry skin across all age groups for better consistency in achieving treatment goals. (",

      "abstract": "Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is characterized by a persistent intraoral burning sensation, often experienced by postmenopausal women. The etiology of BMS remains partially understood, and consequently, treatments remain suboptimal. Extraoral manifestations of BMS, such as extraoral dryness, are less studied. However, it has been suggested that the identification of the frequency and patterns of extraoral dryness and potential underlying mechanisms are essential to optimize treatment strategies and reduce the burden of disease. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review to provide existing evidence about extraoral dryness in BMS. The guidelines for the conduction and reporting of systematic reviews were followed. An electronic search was conducted in four major databases-PubMed, Web of Science, COCHRANE Library, and EBSCOhost-and the grey literature was assessed through Google Scholar. From each included article, information on extraoral dryness in BMS was extracted, and odds ratios were calculated for extraoral dryness among BMS patients compared with non-BMS controls. The findings demonstrated higher odds of the prevalence of extraoral dryness in BMS, which was found to a high degree in the lips, eyes, skin, and genitalia. The pattern of spread and locations of extraoral dryness propose a potential central mechanism. Based on our findings, we encourage the standardization of the assessment, recording, and reporting of the extraoral characteristics of BMS, including extraoral dryness, which can lead to better management strategies and enhance the quality of life of the affected patients.",

      "abstract": "In recent times, a considerable amount of evidence has come to light regarding the effect that air pollution has on skin conditions. The human skin is the chief protection we have against environmental harm, whether biological, chemical, or physical. The stress from these environmental factors, along with internal influences, can be a cause of skin aging and enlarged pores, thinner skin, skin laxity, wrinkles, fine lines, dryness, and a more fragile dermal layer. This knowledge has led to greater demand for skin cosmetics and a requirement for natural raw ingredients with a high degree of safety and efficiency in combating skin complications. Recent developments in green technology have made the employment of naturally occurring bioactive compounds more popular, and novel extraction methods have ensured that the use of these compounds has greater compatibility with sustainable development principles. Thus, there is a demand for investigations into efficient non-harmful naturally occurring raw ingredients; compounds derived from algae could be beneficial in this area. Algae, both macroalgae and microalgae, consists of waterborne photosynthetic organisms that are potentially valuable as they have a range of bioactive compounds in their composition. Several beneficial metabolites can be obtained from algae, such as antioxidants, carotenoids, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA), pigments, polysaccharides, and scytonemin. Various algae strains are now widely employed in skincare products for various purposes, such as a moisturizer, anti-wrinkle agent, texture-enhancing agents, or sunscreen. This research considers the environmental stresses on human skin and how they may be mitigated using cosmetics created using algae; special attention will be paid to external factors, both generally and specifically (amongst them light exposure and pollutants).",

      "abstract": "Epidermal differentiation disorders (EDDs) encompass inherited conditions characterized by abnormal epidermal differentiation, including nonsyndromic and syndromic subtypes with more extensive cutaneous involvement or palmoplantar keratoderma. Nonsyndromic EDDs (nEDDs) are defined as disorders that primarily affect large areas of skin and adnexal structures without alterations in extracutaneous tissues resulting from the underlying genetic change. To facilitate the development of targeted therapies and to provide clinicians with clearer therapeutic guidance, we have developed a new nomenclature for EDDs that includes the causative altered gene and the nEDD subgroup designation, sometimes with a clinical or histological descriptor or acronym. Historically, many nEDDs have been named on the basis of phenotypic characteristics or associations that are now considered outdated or inappropriate. For example, the term 'harlequin ichthyosis' evokes potentially stigmatizing images. Similarly, the word 'ichthyosis' is derived from the Greek ichthys, meaning fish, and the Greek hystrix, meaning porcupine, further emphasizing the need to abandon derogatory terminology. As a result, the clinical relevance of the previous classification, which included eponymous and/or descriptive titles, has diminished. In the new, gene-based classification, old terms considered pejorative, such as ichthyosis, vulgaris, hystrix and harlequin have been eliminated and eponyms have been replaced. Among the 53 genetically distinct nEDDs are conditions formerly known as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis, erythrokeratodermia variabilis et progressiva, Hailey-Hailey disease and Darier-White disease. This review outlines the updated nomenclature and classifications of nEDDs, linked to detailed clinical descriptions and representative photographs to guide practitioners.",

Its most outward layers, the stratum corneum and the epidermis seal our body with an acidic, dry, and rather cool surface, hostile to microbes. Yet, there are also fine-tuned interactions between the mostly commensal microbiota on top of the skin surface, with underlying epidermal cells as well as the immune system, to preserve a healthy steady state and to initiate repair processes when necessary. We take a concise look at the recent insights on the inner workings of this complex barrier.",

      "title": "The Discovery and Function of Filaggrin.",
      "abstract": "Keratohyalin granules were discovered in the mid-19th century in cells that terminally differentiate to form the outer, cornified layer of the epidermis. The first indications of the composition of these structures emerged in the 1960s from a histochemical stain for histidine, followed by radioautographic evidence of a high incidence of histidine incorporation into newly synthesized proteins in cells containing the granules. Research during the next three decades revealed the structure and function of a major protein in these granules, which was initially called the 'histidine-rich protein'. Steinert and Dale named the protein 'filaggrin' in 1981 because of its ability to aggregate keratin intermediate filaments. The human gene for the precursor, 'profilaggrin,' was reported in 1991 to encode 10, 11 or 12 nearly identical repeats. Remarkably, the mouse and rat genes encode up to 20 repeats. The lifetime of filaggrin is the time required for keratinocytes in the granular layer to move into the inner cornified layer. During this transition, filaggrin facilitates the collapse of corneocytes into 'building blocks' that become an impermeable surface barrier. The subsequent degradation of filaggrin is as remarkable as its synthesis, and the end-products aid in maintaining moisture in the cornified layer. It was apparent that ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis were associated with the absence of this protein. McLean's team in 2006 identified the cause of these diseases by discovering loss-of-function mutations in the profilaggrin gene, which led to dysfunction of the surface barrier. This story illustrates the complexity in maintaining a healthy, functional epidermis.",

In contrast to bovine and porcine ECM, marine-derived decellularized ECM has several advantages; it is easily obtained, poses less biological risk, and is not contraindicated on religious grounds. This study successfully fabricated decellularized tilapia fish skin (DTFS) with copious preserved collagen fibers and natural pore structures. The outer layer is smooth and dense, while the inner layer has a soft structure with a rough surface. After crosslinking with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), crosslinked DTFS (C-DTFS) showed improved mechanics in dry and wet conditions. ",

      "title": "Characterization of the structural and mechanical properties of pinecone fish (Monocentris japonica) scales.",
      "abstract": "In this paper, the microstructure characteristics and mechanical properties (including nano-indentation, tensile, and penetration behaviors) of the scales from pinecone fish (Monocentris japonica) were investigated. The M. japonica scales display a unique hierarchical structure and consist of three layers: an outer bone layer with high mineralization, an intermediate bone layer with obvious pore structures, and an inner collagen layer composed of multiple plies of collagen fibers. The hardness and indentation modulus of the three structural layers exhibit gradient changes, and decrease gradually from the outer layer to the inner layer. Tensile tests show that the tensile response and failure modes of the scales are different under dry and hydrated conditions. The dry scales have higher tensile strength (46.35 MPa) and Young's modulus (0.74 GPa), while the hydrated scales exhibit higher ultimate strain (20.18%) and toughness (4.57 MPa). Penetration tests indicate that the scales have a significantly high resistance to penetration, and increase the penetration force by more than six times compared with the descaled skin. Furthermore, the structure-property relationship of the M. japonica scales was discussed. It is found that the hard outer layer and the porous intermediate layer help to disperse the stress, and the soft inner layer containing collagen fiber plies helps to deflect the crack propagation, which are responsible for the excellent mechanical properties of the scales. The outcome of this study can provide a valuable biomimetic design inspiration for lightweight and high-strength composite materials in engineering fields. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: Microstructure characteristics and mechanical properties of the Monocentris japonica scales were investigated. The M. japonica scales can be divided into three layers rather than two layers. The M. japonica scales exhibited high tensile strength and penetration resistance.",

      "abstract": "In autumn and winter, the climate is dry and human skin tends to become dry as a result. The application of hyaluronic acid to a fabric has a certain moisturizing effect, which can further improve the wearing comfort of the fabric. In this study, three knitted fabric structures including weft plain stitch, 1 + 1 mock rib, and 1 + 3 mock rib were designed. The face yarn adopted hyaluronic acid viscose fiber, graphene viscose fiber, nylon, and viscose with different interweaving ratios, and the inner yarn adopted nylon/spandex-coated wire. A total of 18 sample knitted fabrics were woven according to the experimental method of the full test. The effects of the fabric structure and fabric raw materials on skin moisturizing properties were studied and analyzed by testing the skin water content and trans-epidermal water loss before and after coating the fabric on the human skin. The results show that the most significant factor affecting the skin moisture content is the raw material used in the fabric. When the interweaving ratio of hyaluronic acid viscose fiber in the fabric decreases, the moisturizing performance of the fabric on human skin is weakened. The second is the fabric structure. In terms of structure, 1 + 1 mock rib fabric has better moisturizing performance for human skin. When the material adopts hyaluronic acid viscose fiber/graphene viscose fiber (100:0) and the structure adopts 1 + 1 mock rib, the moisturizing effect on human skin is better.",

      "abstract": "Xerosis, characterized by dry, rough skin, causes discomfort and aesthetic concerns, necessitating effective treatment. Traditional treatments often show limited efficacy, prompting the need for innovative therapies. This study highlights the efficacy of microbiome therapeutic LP51, derived from a healthy vaginal microbiome, in improving xerosis. A double-blind clinical trial involving 43 subjects with dry inner arm skin compared the effects of a 2.9% LP51 extract formulation to a placebo over 4 weeks. The LP51 group exhibited a significant increase in stratum corneum hydration (10.0 A.U.) compared to the placebo group (4.8 A.U.) and a 21.4% decrease in transepidermal water loss (TEWL), whereas the placebo group showed no significant change. LP51 also demonstrated benefits in enhancing skin hydration, improving the skin barrier, and exhibited anti-atopic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. Safety was confirmed through in vitro cytotoxicity tests. These effects are attributed to the microbiome-safe component in LP51 and its role in improving xerosis, reflected by an increase in the xerosis-microbiome index, defined by the Firmicutes/Actinobacteria ratio. These findings position microbiome therapeutic LP51 as a promising novel treatment for xerosis.",

The present study thus used senescent accelerated prone (SAMP10) and senescent accelerated resistant (SAMR1) mice to examine the connection between aging and histological or biomolecular changes. Mice were divided into three groups: SAMP10 fed a control diet (CD), SAMP10 fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and SAMR1 fed a CD.

In the present work, morphological, microstructural, mechanical and tribological characterization of the shed skin of two snake species, namely Boa Red Tail and Python Regius was carried out. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analyses showed the existence of deterministic patterns, i.e., ordered arrays of geometrical features at the surface, while Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) allowed studying the internal structure and chemical composition of the skin sheds. Nanoindentation measurements showed significant variations in hardness and elastic modulus from the surface to the inner layers of the skin, and pin-on-disc tests revealed anisotropic behavior of the friction coefficient (COF) as a function of the sliding direction against balsa wood in dry conditions. Correlations between the friction data, nano-indentation mechanical properties and subsurface skin structure were established for both species taking into account the ways in which the skins' deterministic patterns influence the tribological performance.",

      "abstract": "In a human skin-fibrous fabric-external environment, fibrous materials, as the \"second skin\" of the human body, provide comfort against the wet and heat effectively. Fibrous materials protect human health and guarantee work efficiency in various outdoor or inner scenes. Personal wet-thermal management based on fibrous materials can regulate comfort in a facile manner with low or zero energy consumption, which has become a potential development area. However, realizing synergistic management of the wet and heat effectively and conveniently is a challenge in the development and production of fibrous materials. We designed and fabricated a Janus fibrous membrane composed of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA)-modified hydrophobic cotton gauze and electrospun carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-doped cellulose acetate (CA) hydrophilic fibrous membrane. Taking advantage of asymmetric wettability along its thickness direction, the Janus fibrous membrane, acting as a \"liquid diode\", could transport sweat/moisture from human skin to the external environment unidirectionally, which endowed a dry surface on human skin, avoiding \"stickiness\", and realizing wet management. Doped CNTs had good photothermal-conversion capacity, so the Janus membrane exhibited excellent heating capacity for passive radiation, so excellent synergistic wet-thermal management was obtained. The Janus membrane could be a candidate for diverse applications of fibrous membranes. Our data provide new ideas for the design and fabrication of fibrous membranes with remarkable wet-thermal management.",

      "title": "Effects of Housing and Management Systems on the Growth, Immunity, Antioxidation, and Related Physiological and Biochemical Indicators of Donkeys in Cold Weather.",
      "abstract": "The study was designed with a 2 × 2 factorial experiment to evaluate the effects of growth performance, immune function, antioxidant status, blood biochemical indexes, and hormone levels of donkeys in different housing and management systems in cold weather. Twenty-four male donkeys with similar body weight and age were randomly allocated into four treatment groups that were as follows: a cold-water-drinking group without a windproof facility, a lukewarm-water-drinking group without windproof facilities, a cold-water-drinking group with a windproof facility, and a lukewarm-water-drinking group with a windproof facility. The experiment lasted for 42 days. The results showed that windproof facilities increased average daily gain (ADG) and decreased average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed-to-gain ratio (F:G) at all time periods (p < 0.01) of the experiment. Windproof facilities increased the digestibility of dry matter (DM), crude fat (CF), crude protein (CP), ash, calcium (Ca), and phosphate (P) on day 21 (p < 0.01), and increased the digestibility of DM, CF, ash, and P on day 42 (p < 0.01). The respiration rate and the skin temperature of the abdomen and legs increased (p < 0.05) and rectal temperature tended to increase (p = 0.083) by adopting windproof facilities at 07:00; the windproof facilities tended to increase the skin temperature of the ears and abdomen (p = 0.081, p = 0.091) at 14:00. For the blood parameters, with windproof facilities, the concentrations of total protein (TP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased (p < 0.05) and glucose (GLU) concentration decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 21; the concentrations of TG and cholesterol (CHO) increased and the concentrations of TP, BUN, and GLU decreased at 07:00 on day 42 (p < 0.05). The concentrations of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol (COR), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4) decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 21, and T4 concentration decreased (p < 0.05) at 07:00 on day 42. The concentrations of interleukin-4 (IL-4), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immunoglobulin M (IgM) increased (p < 0.01) and the concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) decreased (p < 0.01) on days 21 and 42. The activities of total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) increased (p < 0.05), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration decreased (p < 0.01) on day 21; the activities of T-SOD and catalase (CAT) increased (p < 0.05), and MDA concentration decreased (p < 0.01) on day 42. However, under the conditions of this experiment, water temperature did not affect the above indexes on days 21 and 42. These results indicated that adopting windproof facilities in a cold climate can mitigate the effects of atrocious weather on the production performance of donkeys.",

      "abstract": "Soft-bottom macrobenthic invertebrates are sensitive to natural or anthropogenic changes in aquatic ecosystems. The distribution patterns of sublittoral macrobenthic species in Guanabara Bay were studied from 2005 to 2007. Samples were collected at ten stations during six surveys throughout the rainfall regime (dry, early and late rainy). Ten replicates were collected at each station by Gravity corer or skin diving. Van Dorn bottles (bottom water) and by Ekman sediment sampler (granulometry) provided material for abiotic data. Stations were grouped into sectors (Entrance, Intermediary and Inner) based on abiotic data and location. The Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and Parsimonious RDA for all years and each annual cycle showed indicator taxa with high dominance in each sector. PERMANOVA indicated a regular seasonality between the surveys for the first annual cycle (p <0.05), and an atypical pattern for the second (p> 0.05), possibly due the low rainfall observed during this period. The mosaic of soft-bottom substrates infers structural variables, and patterns of temporal distribution were basically influenced by parameters those indicating pollution and the SACW (South Atlantic Central Water) intrusion, as well as ecological attributes among species, such as: predation, competition. The Ervilia concentrica and Cypridinidae could be used as indicators for anthropic and natural impacts in the Guanabara Bay for the Entrance sector, while Cyprideis salebrosa and Cyprideis sp. for the Intermediary sector and Heleobia australis for the Inner sector.",

      "abstract": "Textiles with a wicking finish transport moisture away from the skin, such that it is exposed to the environment for fast evaporation, aiding in thermophysiological comfort. Once saturated, such as in highly humid environments or if the wearer dons multiple layers, the efficacy of such a finish is substantially reduced. Here, we develop a new type of fluid transport textile design by combining physical and chemical wettability patterns to transport and remove liquids like sweat. First, a non-toxic, superhydrophobic fabric finish is developed that retains the air permeability of the fabric. Next, two superhydrophobic fabric layers are threaded together, containing wettability channels patterned at the inner/interior side of the fabrics. This design allows for liquid transport through the stitches to the interior channels and keeps both external faces dry. The developed strategy enables directional fluid transport under highly humid conditions, resulting in a ∼20 times faster transport rate than evaporation-based methods. The design principles described here can be used to provide thermophysiological comfort for users in extreme conditions, such as firefighters, law enforcement personnel, and health workers wearing personal protective ensembles.",

      "abstract": "The stratum corneum (SC) consists of a lipid layer that forms two types of lamellar structures: short lamellar (S-La) and long lamellar (L-La). It has been reported that S-La contains water phases in the hydrophilic region of the lipids, and that it may play an important role in regulating the water content of the SC. The amount of water in the SC can affect how a drug carrier permeates through the intercellular lipid pathway. To better understand the impact of SC water content on the skin penetration mechanism of a microemulsion (ME), we conducted a study using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Our results showed that MEs can enhance skin permeation under humid conditions because the lipid packing structures of the hydrated SC are more disrupted than those of the dry SC. The results also showed that the inner water of MEs was released to the SC when applying MEs to the dry SC, resulting in an increase in the repeat distance of S-La. Conversely, when MEs are applied to hydrated SC, the MEs absorb the water from the SC into their inner phases, causing a decrease in the repeat distance of S-La over time.",

      "title": "Dual-composite drag-reduction surface based on the multilayered structure and mechanical properties of tuna skin.",
      "abstract": "Energy efficiency and friction reduction have attracted considerable research attention. To design low drag surfaces, researchers derived inspiration from nature on various types of drag reduction methods with exceptional functional surfaces, such as fish skin that possesses low friction. Fishes with high-performance swimming possess a range of physiological and mechanical adaptations that are of considerable interest to physiologists, ecologists, and engineers. Although tuna is a fast-swimming ocean-based predator, most people focus their attention on its nutritional value. In this study, the multilayered structures and mechanical properties of tuna skin are first analyzed, and then the drag-reduction effect of the bionic fish-scale and dual-composite surfaces are studied based on the computational fluid dynamics method. The results indicate that tuna skin is composed of five layers, with the fish scale covered by a flexible epidermis layer. According to the uniaxial tension results, the modulus and tensile strength of the epidermis are obtained as 1.17 and 20 MPa, respectively. The nanoindentation results show that the modulus and hardness of the outer surface of the fish scale are larger than that of the inner surface, while those of the dry state are larger than those of the hydrated state. The simulation results show that both the bionic fish-scale and dual-composite surfaces display drag reduction, with the maximum drag-reduction rate of 25.7% achieved by the bionic dual-composite surface. These findings can offer a reference for in-depth performance analysis of the hydrodynamics of tuna and provide new sources of inspiration for drag reduction and antifouling.",

      "abstract": "Commercial wearable piezoelectric sensors possess excellent anti-interference stability due to their electronic packaging. However, this packaging renders them barely breathable and compromises human comfort. To address this issue, we develop a PVDF piezoelectric nanoyarns with an ultrahigh strength of 313.3 MPa, weaving them with different yarns to form three-dimensional piezoelectric fabric (3DPF) sensor using the advanced 3D textile technology. The tensile strength (46.0 MPa) of 3DPF exhibits the highest among the reported flexible piezoelectric sensors. The 3DPF features anti-gravity unidirectional liquid transport that allows sweat to move from the inner layer near to the skin to the outer layer in 4 s, resulting in a comfortable and dry environment for the user. It should be noted that sweating does not weaken the piezoelectric properties of 3DPF, but rather enhances. Additionally, the durability and comfortability of 3DPF are similar to those of the commercial cotton T-shirts. This work provides a strategy for developing comfortable flexible wearable electronic devices.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is an extremely rare autosomal recessively inherited disease with a prevalence of 1:500.000 caused by mutations on the sulfatase-modifying-Factor 1 gene (SUMF1). MSD is most specifically characterised by a combination of developmentally retarded psychomotoric functions, neurodegeneration that entails the loss of many already acquired abilities, and by ichthyosis. Other symptoms include those associated with mucopolysaccharidosis, i.e., facial dysmorphy, dwarfism, and hepatosplenomegaly. In 50-75% of all MSD-affected patients, functional or structural ocular damage is likely. MSD seldom affects the anterior segment of the eye. The main pathology these patients present is a highly conspicuous tapetoretinal degeneration, similar to severe Retinitis pigmentosa, that leads to blindness at an early age. An initially five-year-old boy with MSD, genetically verified at his first examination in our opthalmology department (SUMF1 mutations c.776A>T, p.Asn259Ile; c.797A>T, p.Pro266Leu; c.836A>T, p.Ala279Val), and a 4, 5 year regular follow-up are described. The patient had some visual potential (\"tunnel view\"), which deteriorated dramatically after his fifth birthday. We observed no evidence of worsening retinal involvement in this patient in spite of his progressively worsening clinical symptoms, extending to total blindness/no light perception. OCT revealed that the outer retinal layers containing photoreceptors were diseased; the ellipsoid zone was only partially discernible and the outer nuclear layer appeared to be thinned out. The inner nuclear layer, ganglion cell layer, and retinal nerve fibre layer were indistinguishable. These anomalies are indicative of a severe pathology within the retina's inner layers. Characteristic anomalies in the fundus should stimulate clinicians to suspect a case of MSD in their differential diagnosis, and thus to order thorough genetic and paediatric diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Hollow-fiber membranes for nanofiltration were prepared from the blending of Poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) with Poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) with different PEG molecular weights (400 and 4000 g/mol) and PVC via a dry/wet spinning process. In the spinning process, the effects of air gap, wind-up speed, dope extrusion rate, and bore extrusion rate were examined. In addition, the different lengths of the center tube, which acted as the inner-side fiber diameter during the preparation of hollow-fiber membranes, were studied. This research was investigated in order to observe the morphological, dielectric, and dynamic mechanical thermal properties to identify a suitable preparation of a hollow-fiber membrane for feasible applications. The morphology of the PVC-580 blended PEG-400 5 weight percent hollow-fiber membrane was seen to have a dense skin on both the inner and outer fiber surface, along with a suitable dope viscosity. Moreover, it offered finger-like substructures that could provide a high applicable feed-stream permeability and selectivity. Finger-like substructures were present on the near inner fiber surface at the controlled center-tube length of 0.3 cm, more so than at the center tube of 1 cm. This was because the solvent and non-solvent in the lumen tube exchanged more quickly than they did in the coagulant bath. The effect of the wind-up speed during the spinning process was significantly influenced by an affordable hollow fiber that can be indicated by the drawing ratio (",

The absence of Hg biomagnification in a certain aquatic environment constitutes an exceptional finding and this seems to be the case for Sepetiba Bay, in Rio de Janeiro state (RJ), Brazil. There are three distinct ecological populations of Guiana dolphins in the Sepetiba Bay (SB)-Ilha Grande Bay (IGB) Complex, inhabiting: (1) the inner part of SB; (2) SB entrance; and (3) IGB. In addition, there are two other delphinid species, rough-toothed dolphin and Atlantic spotted dolphin, that feed on the SB-IGB Complex.

      "abstract": "Soft elastomers are critical to a broad range of existing and emerging technologies. One major limitation of soft elastomers is the large friction of coefficient (COF) due to inherently large adhesion and internal loss. In applications where lubrication is not applicable, such as soft robotics, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices, elastomers with inherently low dry COF are required. Inspired by the low COF of snakeskins atop soft bodies, this study reports the development of elastomers with low dry COF by growing a hybrid skin layer with a strong interface with a large stiffness gradient. Using a solid-liquid interfacial polymerization (SLIP) process, hybrid skin layers are imparted onto elastomers, which reduces the COF of the elastomers from 1.6 to 0.1, without sacrificing the bulk compliance and ductility of elastomer. Compared with existing surface modification methods, the SLIP process offers spatial control and ability to modify flat, prepatterned, curved, and inner surfaces, which is essential to engineer multifunctional skin layers for emerging applications.",

      "abstract": "The current investigation was planned utilizing SEM, histological, and furthermore cytokeratin immunohistochemical to give a full depiction of skin of three reptiles species; Chalcides ocellatus (Scincidae), Uromastyx aegyptia aegyptia (Agamidae), and Psammophis schokari aegyptia (Colubridae) captured from Egypt with various ecological environment. Our SEM results showed different scales covered epidermis of three reptile's species with diverse surface microstructure. Overlapped rhomboid scales with numerous lenticular sense organs with numerous pores and oberhäutchen layer with microridges in C. ocellatus. In U. aegyptia, scales were overlapped elliptical-shaped possess lens-like sense structure with several scattered pits and oberhäutchen layer with polygonal outlined cells. While in P. schokari aegyptia, smooth scales flattened with two large dome-shaped scale receptors/sensilla and lens-like sense structure, moreover polygonal-shaped micro-ornamentation in scale hinge joints were observed. Histologically, skin of three species had outer epidermis with stratum germinativum, stratum corneum (α-keratin, β-keratin layer) capped by surface Oberhäutchen and inner dermis. Osteoderms were observed with dermis of C. ocellatus. There are marked variation within pigment cells types among examined species. Melanophores observed in dermal layer of C. ocellatus, while in U. aegyptia, three pigment cells in tegument dermis; melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores whereas, P. schokari aegyptia had two forms of chromatophore cells (melanophores and iridophores) in dermis and few melanophores scattered between stratum germinativum cells. The highest cytokeratin immunostaining observed in epidermal cell layer of U. aegyptia aegyptia than two other species. Conclusion, dry scaly skin of reptiles reflects a great range of functional aspects and success to adapt with terrestrial life.",

      "abstract": "Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation-π interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation-π hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self-adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode-like one-way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of -1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick-dry sportswear, protective suits, or air-conditioning fabrics.",

      "abstract": "Mask-wearing behavior, common in the post-COVID-19 era, raises concerns for sensitive skin. This split-face study investigated mask-related changes in skin barrier function and microbiome composition among 30 female volunteers with sensitive skin and assessed the mitigating effects of a moisturizer containing biological lipids and probiotics. Skin physiological indicators (transepidermal water loss, erythema index, stratum corneum hydration, pH, temperature) of masked and unmasked areas were collected at baseline, after three hours of mask-wearing, post-tape stripping, and after 24 h, respectively. Microbiome samples collected from the masked areas before and after wearing a medical mask were analyzed with bioinformatics methods. Mask-wearing significantly weakened barrier function in both masked and adjacent unmasked areas, while reducing bacterial diversity. It was also associated with an increase in Cutibacterium (P = 0.110) and decreases in Streptococcus (P = 0.032) and Prevotella (P = 0.026) abundance. Moisturizer application prior to mask-wearing significantly reduced transepidermal water loss and erythema (both P < 0.001) and further improved erythema after 24 h (P = 0.048). These findings demonstrate that mask-wearing can disrupt the skin barrier and microbiome in individuals with sensitive skin and applying a moisturizer beforehand can mitigate mask-related discomforts by aiding barrier repair and reducing sensitivity.",

These individuals typically have darker skin tones compared with white individuals and they often present with unique disorders of the skin or with common disorders that have a unique appearance. Certain skin conditions commonly associated with SOC patients, in contrast to individuals with lighter skin tones, are explained by structural and functional differences between this population and the white population. Variations in functional differences between these two groups are dependent on structural differences in melanosomes, stratum corneum, epidermis and dermis. Understanding the structural distinctions between white populations and SOC populations will provide insight into common disorders in SOC patients, including hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, dry skin, scaliness, xerosis, sensitive skin and keloids. Furthermore, understanding structural and functional skin difference will encourage more research regarding aetiology of disease and therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "There is growing interest in the development of a skin classification system that captures the world's diverse population. The Fitzpatrick skin classification scale is used both clinically and in research settings to determine an individual's skin color. With the high global burden of skin sensitivity (atopic dermatitis, keloid formation, etc), there is a need for a skin classification system that takes into consideration an individual's reaction to environmental insults and injuries. Our proposal builds on the existing Fitzpatrick skin classification scale by asking two additional questions of patients: do patients have sensitive skin; do patients have a history of hypertrophic scarring or keloids. By separating patients into 2 categories (sensitive vs non-sensitive skin), we create a system that can help dermatologists decide on which treatments to offer patients based on their skin classification. Dermatologists can better predict patient outcomes for dermatologic or cosmetic procedures by knowing how they react to environmental insults/injury. Santiago S, Brown R, Shao K, et al.

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence gene sets have been leveraged to overcome the inadequate sensitivity or specificity of single markers. However, growing evidence of heterogeneity among tissues in senescent cell phenotypes and gene expression profiles has highlighted the need for tissue-specific gene sets. SenSkin™ was curated by an expert review of literature on cellular senescence in the skin and characterized with pathway analysis. To validate SenSkin™, it was evaluated for enrichment with chronological aging in a bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset and a pseudobulk RNA-seq dataset. Further, changes to SenSkin™ in different skin cell types with photoaging were evaluated in two single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SenSkin™ predominantly included genes related to the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which were associated with metabolism and multiple aspects of immune responses. SenSkin™ was more enriched in chronologically aged skin than other commonly used cellular senescence and aging gene sets. In scRNA-seq, SenSkin™ displayed significant upregulation due to photoaging in ten skin cell types. In conclusion, SenSkin™ is a human skin-specific senescence gene set validated in chronological aging and photoaging, which may be more effective at detecting senescent cells in the skin than non-tissue-specific gene sets.",

A highly potent, small, and selective TRPA1 inhibitor, 2-methyl-4-phenyl-1-pentanol (1), was discovered in perfumery compounds. Compound 1 demonstrated promising inhibitory activity against a broad range of TRPA1 agonists. A single stereoisomer of 1 was identified as the most effective TRPA1 inhibitor, indicating the potential for stereoselective synthesis to enhance its potency. Additionally, the structure-activity relationship of 1 was evaluated to elucidate the structural features of TRPA1 inhibitors within the fragrance-like compounds. Notably, the topical application of 1 alleviated sensory irritation in individuals with sensitive skin, while the inhalation of 1 resulted in a significant reduction in ammonia irritation, underscoring its efficacy in both skin and airway applications.",

      "title": "Image analysis of cutaneous melanoma histology: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
      "abstract": "The current subjective histopathological assessment of cutaneous melanoma is challenging. The application of image analysis algorithms to histological images may facilitate improvements in workflow and prognostication. To date, several individual algorithms applied to melanoma histological images have been reported with variations in approach and reported accuracies. Histological digital images can be created using a camera mounted on a light microscope, or through whole slide image (WSI) generation using a whole slide scanner. Before any such tool could be integrated into clinical workflow, the accuracy of the technology should be carefully evaluated and summarised. Therefore, the objective of this review was to evaluate the accuracy of existing image analysis algorithms applied to digital histological images of cutaneous melanoma. Database searching of PubMed and Embase from inception to 11th March 2022 was conducted alongside citation checking and examining reports from organisations. All studies reporting accuracy of any image analysis applied to histological images of cutaneous melanoma, were included. The reference standard was any histological assessment of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and/or immunohistochemical staining. Citations were independently deduplicated and screened by two review authors and disagreements were resolved through discussion. The data was extracted concerning study demographics; type of image analysis; type of reference standard; conditions included and test statistics to construct 2 × 2 tables. Data was extracted in accordance with our protocol and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) Statement. A bivariate random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate summary sensitivities and specificities with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Assessment of methodological quality was conducted using a tailored version of the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The primary outcome was the pooled sensitivity and specificity of image analysis applied to cutaneous melanoma histological images. Sixteen studies were included in the systematic review, representing 4,888 specimens. Six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The mean sensitivity and specificity of automated image analysis algorithms applied to melanoma histological images was 90% (CI 82%, 95%) and 92% (CI 79%, 97%), respectively. Based on limited and heterogeneous data, image analysis appears to offer high accuracy when applied to histological images of cutaneous melanoma. However, given the early exploratory nature of these studies, further development work is necessary to improve their performance.",

      "abstract": "Assessing localization of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) in skin nerve fibers is crucial for understanding its role in peripheral neuropathy and pain. However, information on the specificity and sensitivity of TRPV1 antibodies used for immunofluorescence (IF) on human skin is currently lacking. To find a reliable TRPV1 antibody and IF protocol, we explored antibody candidates from different manufacturers, used rat DRG sections and human skin samples for screening and human TRPV1-expressing HEK293 cells for further validation. Final specificity assessment was done on human skin samples. Additionally, we developed two automated image analysis methods: a Python-based deep-learning approach and a Fiji-based machine-learning approach. These methods involve training a model or classifier for nerve fibers based on pre-annotations and utilize a nerve fiber mask to filter and count TRPV1 immunoreactive puncta and TRPV1 fluorescence intensity on nerve fibers. Both automated analysis methods effectively distinguished TRPV1 signals on nerve fibers from those in keratinocytes, demonstrating high reliability as evidenced by excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values exceeding 0.75. This method holds the potential to uncover alterations in TRPV1 associated with neuropathic pain conditions, using a minimally invasive approach.",

      "title": "Molecular biological mechanisms of radiotherapy-induced skin injury occurrence and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Radiotherapy-Induced Skin Injury (RISI) is radiation damage to normal skin tissue that primarily occurs during tumor Radiotherapy and occupational exposure. The risk of RISI is high due to the fact that the skin is not only the first body organ that ionizing radiation comes into contact with, but it is also highly sensitive to it, especially the basal cell layer and capillaries. Typical clinical manifestations of RISI include erythema, dry desquamation, moist desquamation, and ulcers, which have been established to significantly impact patient care and cancer treatment. Notably, our current understanding of RISI's pathological mechanisms and signaling pathways is inadequate, and no standard treatments have been established. Radiation-induced oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, fibrosis, apoptosis, and cellular senescence are among the known mechanisms that interact and promote disease progression. Additionally, radiation can damage all cellular components and induce genetic and epigenetic changes, which play a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of skin injury. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms and pathways is crucial for exploring the potential therapeutic targets for RISI. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the key mechanisms and potential treatment methods for RISI, offering a reference for future research and development of treatment strategies.",

We analyzed dermoscopic images from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, spanning 2016-2020, encompassing a variety of skin lesions. Our approach integrates deep learning with a comprehensive radiomics analysis, utilizing a vast array of quantitative image features to precisely quantify skin lesion patterns. The dataset includes cases of three, four, and eight different skin lesion types. Our methodology was benchmarked against seven classification methods from the ISIC 2020 challenge and prior research using a binary decision framework. The proposed hybrid model demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions, achieving area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores of 99%, 95%, and 96%, and multiclass decoding AUROCs of 98.5%, 94.9%, and 96.4%, with sensitivities of 97.6%, 93.9%, and 96.0% and specificities of 98.4%, 96.7%, and 96.9% in the internal ISIC 2018 challenge, as well as in the external Jinan and Longhua datasets, respectively.

TRPV3 channels not only detect moderate warmth but are also sensitive to chemical ligands that evoke thermal sensations. The activation of TRPV3 by warm temperatures and compounds highlights its importance in the molecular mechanisms underlying skin thermosensation.

      "abstract": "Diagnosis of cutaneous hypopigmentation can sometimes be challenging. Dermoscopy may play a role in identifying hypo or-depigmented dermatoses. The aim was to investigate which dermoscopic criteria represent potent indicators for the diagnosis of vitiligo, nevus depigmentosus, pityriasis alba, hypopigmented pityriasis versicolor, idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis, hypopigmented mycosis fungoides (MF), lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and ash leaf hypopigmented macules of tuberous sclerosis, and evaluate their diagnostic accuracy. 168 individuals diagnosed with one of these hypopigmented disorders were evaluated for the presence or absence of predetermined dermoscopic criteria. Evaluation of dermatoscopic characteristics in each condition and analysis for sensitivity and specificity of dermatoscopic diagnosis in these hypopigmented lesions was performed. The starburst pattern, micro-koebnerization, and trichrome pattern were unique to vitiligo diagnosis. Vitiligo had higher comet-tail appearance, perifollicular pigmentation, and perilesional hyperpigmentation than other hypopigmented illnesses. Other hypopigmented lesions had greater incidence of amoeboid pattern, faint or diminished pigment network, islands of pigmentation, ill-defined boundaries, pseudopods, and widespread scaling than vitiligo. Finally, perifollicular scaling, comedo-like openings, blue-gray specks, and fibrotic regions excluded vitiligo. Dermoscopy can help identify common hypopigmented skin lesions and reduce the need for skin biopsy. Nevus depigmentosus, pityriasis alba and idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis were the top three hypopigmented dermatoses that could be diagnosed by dermoscopy with 100% sensitivity. Vitiligo was in the second rank (94.7%), followed by lichen sclerosis et atrophicus (93.3%) then hypopigmented MF at 81.2% sensitivity. Dermoscopy sensitivity was lowest in pityriasis versicolor and ash leaf macules of tuberous sclerosis (52.6% and 46.7%, respectively).",

However, the riskiest is melanoma, although it starts in a few different ways. The patient is extremely unaware of recognizing skin malignant growth at the initial stage. Literature is evident that various handcrafted and automatic deep learning features are employed to diagnose skin cancer using the traditional machine and deep learning techniques. The current research presents a comparison of skin cancer diagnosis techniques using handcrafted and non-handcrafted features. Additionally, clinical features such as Menzies method, seven-point detection, asymmetry, border color and diameter, visual textures (GRC), local binary patterns, Gabor filters, random fields of Markov, fractal dimension, and an oriental histography are also explored in the process of skin cancer detection. Several parameters, such as jacquard index, accuracy, dice efficiency, preciseness, sensitivity, and specificity, are compared on benchmark data sets to assess reported techniques. Finally, publicly available skin cancer data sets are described and the remaining issues are highlighted.",

Given the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor microcirculatory alterations, we propose a deep learning approach to automated sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction using a single HSI cube acquired within seconds. In a prospective observational study, we collected HSI data from the palms and fingers of more than 480 intensive care unit patients. Neural networks applied to HSI measurements predicted sepsis and mortality with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Performance improved substantially with additional clinical data, reaching AUROCs of 0.94 for sepsis and 0.83 for mortality. We conclude that deep learning-based HSI analysis enables rapid and noninvasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, with a potential clinical value for enhancing diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "S100 proteins comprise a family of structurally related proteins that are calcium-sensitive. S100 proteins have been found to play various roles in regulation of cell apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation, cell migration and invasion, energy metabolism, calcium homeostasis, protein phosphorylation, anti-microbial activity and inflammation in a variety of cell types. While the specific function of many S100 proteins remains unknown, some of the S100 proteins serve as disease biomarkers as well as possible therapeutic targets in skin diseases. Interface dermatitis (ID) is a histopathological term that covers many different skin conditions including cutaneous lupus erythematosus, lichen planus, and dermatomyositis. These pathologies share similar histological features, which include basal cell vacuolization and lymphocytic infiltration at the dermal-epidermal junction. In this review, we summarize how the S100 protein family contributes to both homeostatic and inflammatory processes in the skin. We also highlight the role of S100 proteins in neuronal signalling, describing how this might contribute to neuroimmune interactions in ID and other skin pathologies. Last, we discuss what is known about the S100 family proteins as both biomarkers and potential treatment targets in specific pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Temperature sensitive receptors in the skin and deep body enable the detection of the external and internal environment, including the perception of thermal stimuli. Changes in heat balance require autonomic (e.g., sweating) and behavioral (e.g., seeking shade) thermoeffector initiation to maintain thermal homeostasis. Sex differences in body morphology can largely, but not entirely, account for divergent responses in thermoeffector and perceptual responses to environmental stress between men and women. Thus, it has been suggested that innate differences in thermosensation may exist between men and women. Our goal in this review is to summarize the existing literature that investigates localized and whole-body cold and heat exposure pertaining to sex differences in thermal sensitivity and perception, and the interplay between autonomic and behavioral thermoeffector responses. Overall, it appears that local differences in thermal sensitivity and perception are minimized, yet still apparent, when morphological characteristics are well-controlled. Sex differences in the early vasomotor response to environmental stress and subsequent changes in blood flow likely contribute to the heightened thermal awareness observed in women. However, the contribution of thermoreceptors to observed sex differences in thermal perception and thermoeffector function is unclear, as human studies investigating these questions have not been performed.",

      "abstract": "Determining whether an injury was sustained in life or not is one of the most important topics in forensic medicine. Morphological, cytological, and biological techniques are used to assess wound vitality. Several markers involved in vital and supravital reactions increase the accuracy of wound age estimation. This systematic review aimed to investigate the main vitality markers used in forensic medicine to date. This review was conducted by performing a systematic literature search on online resources (PubMed Central database and Google Scholar) until May 2022. We identified 46 articles published between 1987 and May 2022, analyzing a total of 53 markers. Based on the data of this review, the most studied vitality markers were adhesion molecules (fibronectin, p-selectin, CD 15), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α), cathepsin D, tryptase, and microRNAs (miRNAs). The most interesting studies were based on animal models: the different markers were investigated through immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR methods. The experimental methods were usually based on skin incisions, ligature marks, and burned skin areas. To date, it has not been possible to identify any gold standard markers based on the criteria of efficacy, specificity, and reliability; however, studies are still in progress. In the future, the use of miRNAs is promising as well as the combination of multiple markers. In this way, it will be possible to increase the sensitivity and specificity to validate systems or models for determining wound vitality in forensic practice.",

      "title": "Rosacea in East Asian populations: Clinical manifestations and pathophysiological perspectives for accurate diagnosis.",
      "abstract": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder primarily affecting the facial skin, prominently involving the cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, and periorbital area. Cutaneous manifestations encompass persistent facial erythema, phymas, papules, pustules, telangiectasia, and flushing. The pathogenesis of rosacea is associated with various exacerbating or triggering factors, including microbial infestation, temperature fluctuations, sunlight exposure, physical exertion, emotional stress, consumption of hot beverages and spicy foods, and exposure to airborne pollen. These environmental factors interact with genetic predispositions in the development of rosacea. The roles of the lipophilic microbiome, ultraviolet radiation, nociceptive responses, and vascular alterations have been proposed as significant factors in the pathogenesis. These insights contribute to understanding the anatomical specificity of facial involvement and the progressive nature of rosacea. East Asian skin, predominantly classified as Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III to IV, is characterized by relatively diminished skin barrier function and increased sensitivity to irritants. Airborne pollen exposure may particularly act as a trigger in East Asian individuals, possibly mediated through toll-like receptors. The lack of specificity in objective clinical and histopathological findings leads to diagnostic challenges for individuals with colored skin, including East Asians, particularly when erythema is the sole objective manifestation. An alternative diagnostic scheme may thus be necessary. A diagnostic approach emphasizing vascular manifestations and nociceptive symptoms potentially holds promise for individuals with darker skin tones. More research focusing on potential variations in skin physiology across different racial groups is essential to establish more effective diagnostic schemes applicable to both dark and light skin colors.",

      "abstract": "Chemicals, including some systemically administered xenobiotics and their biotransformations, can be detected noninvasively using skin swabs and untargeted metabolomics analysis. We sought to understand the principal drivers that determine whether a drug taken orally or systemically is likely to be observed on the epidermis by using a random forest classifier to predict which drugs would be detected on the skin. A variety of molecular descriptors describing calculated properties of drugs, such as measures of volume, electronegativity, bond energy, and electrotopology, were used to train the classifier. The mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.71 for predicting drug detection on the epidermis, and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) model interpretation technique was used to determine the most relevant molecular descriptors. Based on the analysis of 2561 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, we predict that therapeutic drug classes, such as nervous system drugs, are more likely to be detected on the skin. Detecting drugs and other chemicals noninvasively on the skin using untargeted metabolomics could be a useful clinical advancement in therapeutic drug monitoring, adherence, and health status.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a multifactorial skin pathology resulting from genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers that lead to epidermal and immune dysfunction. There is now strong evidence that non-lesional (NL) psoriatic skin, despite its normal appearance, represents an intermediate state between healthy and lesional skin. Changes observed in NL skin mainly affect the skin barrier, keratinocytes, innate and adaptive immune responses, the microbiota and neurogenic tissue innervation. Several epidermal barrier defects are commonly observed in NL skin compared to healthy skin, including an elevated pH, delayed barrier function repair after injury and lower expression of epidermal differentiation complex proteins. NL keratinocytes also show a predisposition for activation and proliferation, and an increased sensitivity to cytokine or microbial triggers, probably linked to their unique transcriptome and proteome, associated with their intermediate state between healthy and lesional cells. In addition, the accumulation of pathogenic IL-17-producing resident memory T cells, which can (re)instigate the formation of new lesions, characterises both the NL and never-lesional skin of patients with psoriasis. Although the contribution of NL skin dysbiosis to psoriasis pathophysiology remains to be clarified, the expression of numerous pruritogenic mediators appears to be involved in disease progression due to an iterative itch-scratch cycle. In summary, the NL skin of patients with psoriasis exhibits numerous hallmarks of dormant psoriasis. The fact that these alterations are mostly located in the epidermis suggests that they are readily accessible to topical treatments, which could prevent the recurrence/spread of this chronic disease.",

      "abstract": "Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful technique for nanoscale imaging and mechanical analysis of biological specimens. It is based on the highly sensitive detection of forces and displacement of a sharp-tipped cantilever as it scans the surface of an object. Because it requires minimal sample processing and preparation, AFM is particularly advantageous for the analysis of cells and tissues in their near-native state. Moreover, recent advances in Bio-AFM systems and the combination with light microscopy imaging have greatly enhanced the application of AFM in biological research. In the field of dermatology, the method has led to important insights into our understanding of the biomechanics of normal healthy skin and the pathogenesis of a variety of skin diseases. In this Research Techniques Made Simple article, we review the fundamental principles of AFM, how AFM can be applied to the analysis of cell and tissue mechanics, and recent applications of AFM in skin science and dermatology.",

The burden of this condition, and the resulting clinical and psychological sequelae, is substantial. The visual appearance of acne and its sequelae, including scarring and pigment changes, frequently results in psychological and social morbidity because of concerns about appearance. As understanding of the pathophysiology has evolved, approaches to achieving the optimal outcomes with effective treatment regimens continue to emerge. In the past few years, several novel therapeutics have been developed, including new agents aimed at reducing antimicrobial resistance and products with specific actions targeting retinoid receptors and androgen receptors. This Review considers the management approaches of an adolescent with acne vulgaris and reviews treatment options from the evidence base and international expert opinion. Approaches to selecting current treatments and novel and emerging treatment regimens are discussed.",

Characterized by various lesion types, the pathogenesis of acne is complex, involving genetic, hormonal, microbial, and inflammatory factors. This review comprehensively addresses current and emerging acne management strategies, emphasizing both topical and systemic treatments, procedural therapies, and dietary modifications. Key topical agents include retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, antibiotics, and other specialized compounds. Systemic options like antibiotics, hormonal therapies, and retinoids offer significant therapeutic benefits, particularly for moderate to severe cases. Procedural treatments such as laser devices, photodynamic therapy, chemical peels, and intralesional injections present viable alternatives for reducing acne symptoms and scarring. Emerging therapies focus on novel biologics, bacteriophages, probiotics, and peptides, providing promising future options. This review underscores the importance of personalized approaches to treatment due to the multifaceted nature of acne, highlighting the potential of innovative therapies for improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "A variety of applications of human adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes have been suggested as novel cell-free therapeutic strategies in the regenerative and aesthetic medical fields. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes as an adjuvant therapy after application of fractional CO2 laser for acne scars. A 12-week prospective, double-blind, randomized, split-face trial was performed. A total of 25 patients received 3 consecutive treatment sessions of fractional CO2 laser to the whole face, with a follow-up evaluation. Post-laser treatment regimens were applied; for each patient, one side of the face was treated with adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes gel and the other side was treated with control gel. Adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes-treated sides had achieved a significantly greater improvement than the control sides at the final follow-up visit (percentage reduction in échelle d'évaluation clinique des cicatrices d'acné scores: 32.5 vs 19.9%, p < 0.01). Treatment-related erythema was milder, and post-treatment downtime was shorter on the applications of human adipose tissue stem cell-derived exosomes-treated side. In conclusion, the combined use of this novel material with resurfacing devices would provide synergistic effects on both the efficacy and safety of atrophic acne scar treatments.",

In this review article, we clarify what management options are available to treat acne during pregnancy. Topical treatments, typically first-line for acne, such as azelaic acid, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, dapsone, and retinoids, were reviewed. Systemic treatments, such as zinc supplements, cephalexin, cefadroxil, amoxicillin, azithromycin, erythromycin, and corticosteroids, typically second-line for acne, were also reviewed. Alternative treatments such as light therapy and cosmetic procedures were also evaluated. Due to recommendation of sunscreen utilization during acne treatments, sunscreen usage during pregnancy was also assessed. Management of acne during unplanned pregnancy was discussed in further detail regarding safety and adverse effects. Through summarized tables and examples of studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of treatments, the following is a resource for providers and patients to utilize for management of acne during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Acne is a highly common skin disease especially among teenagers. Modern acne treatments are based also on the use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens. In choosing the right cleanser, it is important to consider some aspects: the interaction between skin type and the cleanser, the optimal time and method of cleaning and the cosmetic perception of the patient. The aim of our review is to highlight the importance of choosing the most suitable topical dermocosmetics for the different skin types, as well as the most effective timing and method to combine dermocosmetics with the standard acne treatment. A search in literature for selected key words was performed using PubMed. Additional papers were identified based on author expertise. Treatment of acne patients should include education for proper daily skin hygiene, including protection from environmental damage. However, given the low number of clinical studies on cleansers, it is difficult to make reliable recommendations. The correct choice and use of topical dermocosmetics are fundamental in the management of acne patients. Daily use of moisturizers, cleansers and sunscreens can reduce both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesion counts and may be helpful for acne treatment if combined with specific drugs.",

      "abstract": "Topical retinoids have an essential role in treatment of acne. Trifarotene, a topical retinoid selective for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) γ, is the most recent retinoid approved for treatment of acne. RAR-γ is the most common isoform of RARs in skin, and the strong selectivity of trifarotene for RAR-γ translates to efficacy in low concentration. Trifarotene, like other topical retinoids, acts by increasing keratinocyte differentiation and decreasing proliferation, which reduces hyperkeratinization. Retinoids have also been shown to inhibit inflammatory pathways via effects on leukocyte migration, toll-like receptors, and Activator Protein (AP)-1. Large-scale randomized, controlled clinical trials have demonstrated trifarotene to be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in reducing both comedones and papules/pustules of acne. However, unlike all other retinoids, trifarotene is the first topical retinoid with rigorous clinical data on safety and efficacy in truncal acne. Data supporting use of trifarotene to manage acne are reviewed in this publication.",

      "abstract": "Acne is a common, chronic inflammatory condition affecting millions of people worldwide, with significant negative impact on quality of life and mental health. Acne is characterized by comedones, inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions, with long-lasting sequelae including scarring and dyspigmentation, the latter of which is more common in skin of color. The four main pillars of acne pathophysiology include alteration of sebum production and concentration, hyperkeratinization of the follicular unit, Cutibacterium acnes strains, and an inflammatory immune response. Newer research has provided greater insight into these pathophysiologic categories. This greater understanding of acne pathogenesis has led to numerous new and emerging treatment modalities. These modalities include combinations of existing treatments, repurposing of existing agents historically used for other conditions, new topical treatments, novel antibiotics, topical and oral probiotics, and various procedural devices. This article will provide an overview of emerging treatments of acne and their link to our current and improved understanding of acne pathogenesis.",

Photons from visible light are absorbed by photoreceptive chromophores (e.g., melanin, heme, and opsins), altering skin function by activating and imparting energy to chromophores. Additionally, visible light can penetrate the full thickness of the skin and induce pigmentation and erythema. Clinically, lasers and light devices are used to treat skin conditions by utilizing specific wavelengths and treatment parameters. Red and blue light from light-emitting diodes and intense pulsed light have been studied as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory treatments for acne. Pulsed dye lasers are used to treat vascular lesions in adults and infants. Further research is necessary to determine the functional significance of visible light on skin health without confounding the influence of ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory disease of the hair follicle-sebaceous gland unit and is the most common skin disorder worldwide. Although it can occur at any age, it predominantly affects young individuals, manifesting as comedones, papules, pustules, cysts, and nodules, primarily in the sebaceous-rich areas of the face, often in a symmetrical distribution. The development of acne vulgaris is believed to result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including sun exposure, skincare habits, diet, sleep patterns, and psychological stress, all of which can induce or exacerbate the condition. The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris involves androgen-induced sebaceous gland hyperplasia, excessive sebum production, abnormal follicular duct keratinization, microbial colonization, and immune-inflammatory responses. Historically, treatment has focused on regulating sebum production, improving follicular keratinization, and providing antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapies, with less attention given to repairing the skin barrier. Treatment outcomes have often been suboptimal, with frequent recurrences, high incidence of skin sensitivity, and significant economic and psychological burdens on patients. This review explores the mechanisms of skin barrier impairment in acne vulgaris and discusses strategies for its repair, offering new perspectives for the clinical management of acne.",

      "abstract": "Photobiomodulation (PBM) is an emerging treatment modality in dermatology with increasing office and home-based use. PBM is the use of various light sources in the red light (620-700 nm) and near-infrared (700-1440 nm) spectrum as a form of light therapy. PBM is often administered through low-level lasers or light-emitting diodes. Studies show that PBM can be used effectively to treat conditions secondary to cancer therapies, alopecia, ulcers, herpes simplex virus, acne, skin rejuvenation, wounds, and scars. PBM offers patients many benefits compared to other treatments. It is noninvasive, cost-effective, convenient for patients, and offers a favorable safety profile. PBM can be used as an alternative or adjuvant to other treatment modalities including pharmacotherapy. It is important for dermatologists to gain a better clinical understanding of PBM for in-office administration and to counsel patients on proper application for home-use devices to best manage safety and expectations as this technology develops. PBM wavelengths can induce varied biological effects in diverse skin types, races, and ethnicities; therefore, it is also important for dermatologists to properly counsel their skin of color patients who undergo PBM treatments. Future clinical trials are necessary to produce standardized recommendations across conditions and skin types.",

      "abstract": "Although intense pulsed light (IPL) has been commonly used in the field of medical cosmetics in recent years, the exact outcomes of IPL in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases remain unclear. To assess the clinical evidence for the use of IPL in the treatment of various inflammatory skin diseases and propose evidence-based recommendations, we searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Web of Science databases and provided updated information. The inflammatory skin diseases treated with IPL consisted of acne vulgaris, rosacea, psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), atopic dermatitis (AD), Riehl's melanosis, lupus erythematosus, cutaneous sarcoidosis, pilonidal cysts, and pigmented actinic lichen planus (PALP). The efficacy of IPL treatment for these inflammatory skin diseases was described and evaluated. Forty-two studies were included to provide this assessment. The evidence suggests that IPL can effectively and safely improve acne vulgaris and rosacea (recommendation grade B). For other described inflammatory skin diseases, IPL can be used as a tentative or supplementary treatment (recommendation grade C and D). The main complications include transitory erythema, edema, and pain, with the possibility of hyperpigmentation, blisters, and a burning sensation in some individuals.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris can be associated with hyperpigmentation, particularly in individuals with skin of color. This acne-induced macular hyperpigmentation (AMH), also called postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, is often long lasting and negatively impacts quality of life. Large-scale, randomized, controlled clinical trials with regard to the treatment of acne and AMH are lacking. For this reason, evidence-based treatment recommendations cannot be made. However, AMH is a common condition, and it is important for clinicians to have guidance on management strategies. The authors, a group of 10 board-certified dermatologists, conducted a modified Delphi consensus process to reach a consensus on first-line therapy for AMH and determine whether therapeutic choices change in different patient subgroups. We reached a consensus that most patients with acne and AMH should receive early and efficacious acne treatment with a topical retinoid and benzoyl peroxide. Therapies aimed at addressing AMH-including hydroquinone, azelaic acid, chemical peel, or antioxidants-may also be considered for enhancing the effect of the treatment regimen on acne and pigmentation. Chemical peels may be used as adjunctive or second-line therapy. This article details the results of the Delphi process, reviews relevant literature for providing recommendations for AMH, and discusses appropriate treatment options.",

      "title": "Update: Mechanisms of Topical Retinoids in Acne.",
      "abstract": "Topical retinoids are the cornerstone of current acne management due to their actions on multiple facets of acne pathophysiology. Retinoids are a family of compounds that structurally and functionally resemble vitamin A, an essential nutrient with a key role in cellular growth and differentiation. In the skin, retinoids exert their effects by binding retinoic acid receptors (RARs) in the cell nucleus with subsequent regulation of gene transcription. There are three subtypes of RARs, and the topical retinoids currently approved for acne have differing receptor binding profiles which may translate to clinical differences, since the specific RAR subtypes activated dictate the biological response of target cells. The activity of a retinoid depends on cellular transport, receptor-binding pattern and affinity, and the genes activated. This review discusses physiologic pathways in skin that are affected by topical retinoids during acne therapy, with a focus on new data from trifarotene, a retinoid which is highly selective for the RAR-&gamma; receptor. Recently, bioinformatic data comparing gene expression in acne lesions treated with trifarotene versus spontaneously resolving acne lesions showed that trifarotene significantly modulates 67 genes that do not appear in the spontaneously resolving lesion. These genes are involved in cellular migration, activation of adaptive immunity, inflammation, and matrix reorganization. Expression of these trifarotene-regulated genes after treatment and in an active lesion occurred in opposite directions, providing clues to the molecular and genetic response to trifarotene in resolving acne.

Although myriad acne treatments are available, current options may not be sufficient because of a lack of efficacy, limited tolerability, or burden of cost to patients. In this review, we highlight recently approved topical acne treatments, as well as those currently in clinical trials. Novel formulations of tretinoin, tazarotene, and minocycline provide modifications of and improvements to existing products. Trifarotene, a novel fourth-generation retinoid, has demonstrated improved tolerability compared with existing topical retinoids. Clascoterone is a novel first-in-class antiandrogen that topically addresses the hormonal etiology of acne. The late-phase clinical trials pipeline consists of agents with bactericidal and anti-sebum mechanisms. Although it is evident that acne treatments continue to evolve, it is important to recognize the need for further comparative studies among new and existing agents to define optimal treatment algorithms that address not only safety and efficacy but also cost-effective care.",

      "abstract": "Acne is a dermatosis that affects almost 90% of the adolescent population worldwide and its treatment is performed with retinoids, antimicrobials, acids, and topical or systemic antibiotics. Side effects such as skin irritation in addition to microbial resistance to antibiotics are the main side effects found. Phototherapy with blue light is being used as an alternative treatment. Our objective was to analyze the use of blue light to treat inflammatory acne. We conducted a systematic literature review, following the recommendation PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses), including in the sample randomized clinical trial studies that compared blue light with another intervention as control. The research was carried out in the PUBMED and WEB of SCIENCE databases and the methodological quality of the studies evaluated were made by the Cochrane Collaboration Bias Risk Scale. After the exclusion of duplicates, the titles and abstracts of 81 articles were evaluated, and 50 articles were selected for full reading, including in the review at the end 8 articles. Studies have shown significant improvements in the overall picture of acne. It is concluded that despite the great potential in its use in the treatment of acne, there is a need for more detailed trials on the effect of blue light on the treatment of inflammatory acne.",

      "title": "Cosmetic Treatments with Energy-Based Devices in Skin of Color.",
      "abstract": "The use of energy-based devices in cosmetic treatments for patients with higher Fitzpatrick skin types is a topic of concern due to the increased risk of complications such as hyperpigmentation and scarring. Advancements in technology have enabled the development of safe and effective energy-based modalities for improving skin tone, texture, and signs of aging in patients with higher Fitzpatrick skin types. This article reviews various modalities that have shown positive outcomes in Fitzpatrick skin types 4 to 6.Radiofrequency (RF) skin tightening devices have emerged as a noninvasive method for improving skin laxity by stimulating collagen and elastin production without generating excessive heat, making them suitable for darker skin tones. Microfocused ultrasound (MFUS) is another noninvasive option for skin tightening and lifting. By producing thermal coagulation in the deeper layers of the skin, MFUS stimulates collagen production, resulting in improved skin tightness. Fractional laser resurfacing, both ablative and nonablative, offers effective treatment options for various concerns such as acne scars, skin texture, and dyspigmentation. Nonablative fractional lasers, which target water rather than melanin, are particularly safer for darker skin types. Broadband light devices that emit different wavelengths have shown success in skin rejuvenation, improving wrinkles, pore size, erythema, telangiectasias, and dyspigmentation. Additionally, RF microneedling combines the benefits of both modalities, delivering safe treatment for skin laxity and textural concerns. The short-pulse neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser has become a transformative tool for patients with Fitzpatrick skin types 4 to 6. This laser targets melanin, hemoglobin, and water, providing improvements in hyperpigmentation, acne, fine lines, and scar texture. Combining the short-pulse Nd:YAG laser with other treatments like chemical peels or microneedling has shown synergistic effects and enhanced outcomes. Understanding these modalities and tailoring treatments to specific concerns is crucial for safe and effective solutions in patients with higher Fitzpatrick skin types.",

Various procedures and techniques for atrophic acne scarring are discussed in detail, with stronger evidence-based support for lasers (non-fractional, fractional, ablative, and non-ablative), platelet-rich plasma as adjunctive treatment, chemical peels (glycolic acid, trichloroacetic acid, and Jessner's solution), dermal fillers such as hyaluronic acid, and microneedling, and lesser quality evidence for microdermabrasion, subcision, and lipoaspirate grafting. Further research is needed to optimize treatment protocols, assess the efficacy of monotherapies, and establish standardized guidelines for clinicians.

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is a highly prevalent skin condition caused by androgen-induced elevated sebum secretion, abnormal keratinization, bacterial colonization, and inflammation. Current research indicates a link between acne vulgaris and the metabolic syndrome, a group of disorders that includes obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This link is thought to be modulated by excessive concentrations of oxidative stress markers and chronic inflammation, which are included in the pathophysiological mechanisms shared by both conditions. Excessive generation of reactive oxygen species damages cellular components and initiates an inflammatory response, hence promoting the development of both disorders. The current narrative review focuses on the molecular implications of inflammatory, hormonal, and environmental factors in the acne-metabolic syndrome correlation. Furthermore, it outlines the current state of knowledge related to the phyto-therapeutic approach to these conditions as an adjuvant strategy to allopathic treatment, but future multicenter and larger-scale research studies are needed establish new algorithms to be included in the future management of patients with these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Acne fulminans (AF) is a rare and severe form of inflammatory acne presenting clinically with an abrupt outburst of painful, hemorrhagic pustules and ulceration, that may or may not be associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, polyarthritis, and laboratory abnormalities. It typically affects male teenagers with a pre-existing acne. Although the pathogenetic mechanism has not been established yet, a role of genetic, abnormal immunologic response, drugs intake, hormonal imbalance and viral infection, as causal factors, has been identified. AF may occur as a single disease or may be associated with other disorders. Traditionally, AF has been classified, on the basis of the presence of systemic involvement, in \"acne fulminans\" and acne fulminans \"sine fulminans,\" when no systemic involvement is present. Recently, four clinical variants have been proposed: acne fulminans with systemic symptoms (AF-SS), acne fulminans without systemic symptoms (AF-WOSS), isotretinoin-induced acne fulminans with systemic symptoms (IIAF-SS), isotretinoin-induced acne fulminans without systemic symptoms (IIAF-WOSS). The diagnosis of AF is usually based on clinical history and physical examination. No specific laboratory abnormalities are generally found. In selected cases, biopsy and/or radiologic imaging are helpful for a correct diagnosis. The treatment significantly differs from severe acne according to severity of clinical presentation and possible systemic involvement. Currently, systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone) and retinoids (isotretinoin) represent the first choice of treatment. Dapsone, cyclosporine A, methotrexate, azathioprine, levamisole, and biological agents such as anakinra, infliximab, adalimumab may be considered as alternative therapies in selected cases. Adjunctive topical and physical therapies may also be considered.",

      "abstract": "To date, treatment of atrophic acne scars remains a therapeutic challenge for dermatologists, yet there is no standard option on the most effective treatment. Microneedling (MN) is a minimally invasive technology that involves repetitive skin puncture using sterile microneedles to disrupt dermal collagen that connects the scar tissue. Recent studies have demonstrated the potency of MN, such as dermaroller and fractionated microneedle radiofrequency, in the treatment of atrophic scars. The objective of this review is to evaluate systematically the current literature on MN for atrophic acne scars. A systematic search of literature was performed from PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar databases for articles published during the last 20 years. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with full-text version of the manuscript available were included in our study. Nine RCTs were included in this review. All treatment modalities demonstrated consistent results that MN was efficacious in treating atrophic acne scars as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments. Moreover, no serious adverse effects were reported in all studies after MN treatment. MN is a well-tolerated and effective therapeutic modality in treating atrophic acne scars. Further research is required to validate the efficacy of MN with a larger sample size and lengthy follow-up.",

      "abstract": "Acne is a common cause for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), particularly in patients with skin of color (SOC), and PIH is often more distressing to patients than the acne itself. Topical retinoids are approved for the treatment of acne and for pigmentation disorders such as melasma or mottled hyperpigmentation associated with photodamage; moreover, they have been shown to reduce hyperpigmentation in patients with SOC. Therefore, treatment with topical retinoids should be started as early as possible unless contraindicated. Use of novel formulations or application of commonly recommended moisturizers may help reduce irritation. Combining retinoids with other topical agents and procedures such as superficial chemical peels can help to improve hyperpigmentation. Primary acne lesions are likely to improve weeks before PIH resolves and helping patients manage their expectations may reduce frustration. Providing clinicians and researchers with more education about the presentation and management of dermatologic conditions in patients with SOC is also recommended.",

Other autoinflammatory syndromes caused by mutations in PSTPIP1 gene or characterized by clinical findings overlapping with those found in PAPA syndrome have been recently included in the group of PAPA spectrum disorders. These disorders are PASH (PG, acne and hidradenitis suppurativa [HS]), PAPASH (PASH associated with pyogenic sterile arthritis), PsAPASH (PASH combined with psoriatic arthritis [PsA], PASS (PG, acne, ankylosing spondylitis, with or without HS), PAC (PG, acne and ulcerative colitis [UC]) and PAMI syndrome (PSTPIP1-associated myeloid-related-proteinemia inflammatory syndrome). Except for PAPA and PAMI, no specific pathogenetic mutations have been identified in these syndromes. Dermatologists should be aware that PG, acne and HS may represent cutaneous signs hiding the presence of these rare entities. Systemic corticosteroids, a number of immunosuppressants and biologics, such as interleukin (IL)-1 antagonists and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α inhibitors, are nowadays therapy for these diseases. A pathogenesis-driven treatment is the near future in the management of these conditions.",

In order to optimize acne control, light and laser-based devices are gaining popularity due to their efficacy and durable results. In this review, we explore the principles of visible light therapy, photodynamic therapy, photopneumatic therapy, intense pulsed light, pulse dye laser, potassium titanyl phosphate lasers, infrared lasers, and the novel 1726 nm fiber-coupled diode lasers in the treatment of acne vulgaris.",

      "abstract": "Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatologic complaints. Recently, isotretinoin has been used as an off-label indication for the treatment of mild-to-moderate grades of acne not responding to conventional treatment. Its conventional recommended dose is 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day to the cumulative dose of 120-150 mg/kg. To qualify the state of evidence and analyze the efficacy of the low-daily dose and the pulsed doses of isotretinoin in treating mild-to-moderate acne patients with regards to response and relapse rates. Systematic review and meta-analysis using an electronic literature search were performed. The 320 potentially relevant articles were included and reviewed. The level of evidence is moderate to low as conducted by the GRADE quality of evidence assessment. The pooled statistical estimate for response to treatment in the group comparing low-daily doses with conventional dose showed an overall benefit for conventional dose. On the other hand, pooled data from the group comparing the low-daily dose with the pulsed doses yielded an overall beneficial effect from using the low-daily dose compared with the pulsed doses on achieving the response. Given all of the available studies, the quality of evidence is low. It appears that conventional dose isotretinoin improves the odds of prolonged remission in adults with mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris compared to the low doses.",

It is expected to be the world's number one consumer cosmetics market by 2050, with a size of approximately US$450 billion. The influence of social media and the internet has raised awareness of the risks associated with the usage of many chemicals in cosmetics and the health benefits of natural products derived from plants and other natural resources. As a result, the cosmetic industry is now paying more attention to natural products. The present review focus on the possible applications of natural products from various biological sources in skin care cosmetics, including topical care products, fragrances, moisturizers, UV protective, and anti-wrinkle products. In addition, the mechanisms of targets for evaluation of active ingredients in cosmetics and the possible benefits of these bioactive compounds in rejuvenation and health, and their potential role in cosmetics are also discussed.",

Safety, compatibility with all types of skin, fewer side effects, and availability are among the advantages of herbal cosmetics above synthetic ingredients. The present review aims to explore the most important plants used in cosmetics. A literature search was carried out in several electronic databases with the following phrases: skincare and plants; cosmetics and plants; natural and cosmetics; and natural and skincare. Furthermore, more detailed filters such as clinical studies, meta-analyses, and systemic reviews were applied to positive results. Various plants and plant extracts currently used in skin care, scaring, whitening, and aging, as well as in sun protection, acne, eczema, and others, have been included in this review. The effectiveness of these plants is based mainly on preclinical research, and to a lesser extent on clinical studies. Some plant extracts or oils have been tested clinically, such as onions, aloe, and tea tree oil, more than other plant extracts. Despite many studies on natural products to improve dermal needs, proper clinical cosmeceutical trials are much fewer than expected. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to evaluate appropriate efficacy. Furthermore, new formulation technologies might enhance the cosmeceutical benefits, but more work is warranted.",

      "title": "Aromatic plants as cosmeceuticals: benefits and applications for skin health.",
      "abstract": "This review highlights the potential of aromatic plants as natural antioxidants in cosmeceuticals to combat skin aging and promote health and rejuvenation. Aromatic plant extracts, essential oils, or their phytoconstituents have a long history of use in skincare, dating back centuries. Currently, these plant-based sources are extensively researched and utilized in the cosmeceutical industry to formulate products that enhance skin health and promote a youthful appearance. These plants' diverse bioactivities and sensory properties make them ideal ingredients for developing anti-aging agents recommended for maintaining healthy skin through self-care routines, offering a natural alternative to synthetic products. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the dermis, attributed to intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors, particularly prolonged sun exposure, is identified as the primary cause of skin aging. Plant extracts enriched with antioxidant compounds including flavonoids, phenolics, tannins, stilbenes, terpenes, and steroids, are fundamental to counteract ROS-induced oxidative stress. Noteworthy effects observed from the use of these natural sources include photoprotective, senolytic, anti-inflammatory, anti-wrinkle, anti-acne, and anti-tyrosinase activities, encompassing benefits like photoprotection, wound healing, skin whitening, anti-pigmentation, tissue regeneration, among others.

      "abstract": "Melanin is an amino acid derivative produced by melanocyte through a series of enzymatic reactions using tyrosinase as substrate. Human skin and hair color is also closely related to melanin, so understanding the mechanisms and proteins that produce melanin is very important. There are many proteins involved in the process of melanin expression, For example, proteins involved in melanin formation such as p53, HNF-1α (Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α), SOX10 (Sry-related HMg-Box gene 10) and pax3 (paired box gene 3), MC1R(Melanocortin 1 Receptor), MITF (Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), TYR (tyrosinase), TYRP1 (tyrosinase-related protein-1), TYRP2 (tyrosinase-related protein-2), and can be regulated by changing their content to control the production rate of melanin. Others, such as OA1 (ocular albinism type 1), Par-2 (protease-activated receptor 2) and Mlph (Melanophilin), have been found to control the transfer rate of melanosomes from melanocytes to keratinocytes, and regulate the amount of human epidermal melanin to control the depth of human skin color. In addition to the above proteins, there are other protein families also involved in the process of melanin expression, such as BLOC, Rab and Rho. This article reviews the origin of melanocytes, the related proteins affecting melanin and the basic causes of related gene mutations. In addition, we also summarized the active ingredients of 5 popular whitening cosmetics and their mechanisms of action.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosinases are copper-containing metalloenzymes involved in several processes in both mammals, insects, bacteria, fungi and plants. Their phenol oxidation properties are especially responsible for human melanogenesis, potentially leading to abnormal pigmentation, and for postharvest vegetable tissue browning. Thus, targeting tyrosinases attracts interest for applications both in dermocosmetic and agrofood fields. However, a large part of the literature about tyrosinase inhibitors is dedicated to the report of copper-interacting phenolic compounds, that are more likely alternative substrates leading to undesirable toxic quinones production. To circumvent this issue, the use of catechol-mimicking copper-chelating groups that are analogues of the tyrosinase oxidation transition state appears as a valuable strategy. Relying on several non-oxidizable pyridinone, pyrone or tropolone moieties, innovative inhibitors were developed, especially within the past decade, and the best reported analogues reached IC",

      "abstract": "Plasminogen is an abundant plasma protein that exists in various zymogenic forms. Plasmin, the proteolytically active form of plasminogen, is known for its essential role in fibrinolysis. To date, therapeutic targeting of the fibrinolytic system has been for 2 purposes: to promote plasmin generation for thromboembolic conditions or to stop plasmin to reduce bleeding. However, plasmin and plasminogen serve other important functions, some of which are unrelated to fibrin removal. Indeed, for >40 years, the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid has been administered for its serendipitously discovered skin-whitening properties. Plasmin also plays an important role in the removal of misfolded/aggregated proteins and can trigger other enzymatic cascades, including complement. In addition, plasminogen, via binding to one of its dozen cell surface receptors, can modulate cell behavior and further influence immune and inflammatory processes. Plasminogen administration itself has been reported to improve thrombolysis and to accelerate wound repair. Although many of these more recent findings have been derived from in vitro or animal studies, the use of antifibrinolytic agents to reduce bleeding in humans has revealed additional clinically relevant consequences, particularly in relation to reducing infection risk that is independent of its hemostatic effects. The finding that many viruses harness the host plasminogen to aid infectivity has suggested that antifibrinolytic agents may have antiviral benefits. Here, we review the broadening role of the plasminogen-activating system in physiology and pathophysiology and how manipulation of this system may be harnessed for benefits unrelated to its conventional application in thrombosis and hemostasis.",

Rutin treatments were performed at the following temperature and pressure conditions: 200 °C/15 bar, 300 °C/100 bar, and 400 °C/250 bar. ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities and reducing power presented their highest values (1193.72 mg AAE/g, 728.73 mg AAE/g, and 0.65, respectively) at 300 °C/100 bar. The tyrosinase inhibitory activity of SCW-treated rutin was 21.72-60.05% at 1 mg/mL. The ethyl acetate fraction showed 14.91% melanin inhibitory activity at a concentration of 10 µg/mL compared to the α-MSH treatment group. The protein expression inhibition rates of MITF, tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2 in the ethyl acetate fractions were 14.05%, 72%, 93.05%, and 53.44%, respectively, at a concentration of 10 µg/mL, compared to the control. These results indicate that SCW treatment could be used to develop cosmetic materials and functional food with physiological activity, and that SCW-treated rutin can be used as a skin-whitening cosmetic material.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the protective effects of low-molecular-weight fish collagen from tilapia against melanogenesis in melanocytes, ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated Hs27 skin fibroblasts, and hairless mice. We observed collagen production-related pathways in UVB-irradiated Hs27 skin fibroblasts and hairless mice, and the melanogenesis-related pathways in melanocyte and UVB-irradiated hairless mice. The collagen production-related pathways were activated in the UVB-irradiated Hs27 skin fibroblasts and hairless mice. In addition, UVB exposure stimulated the melanogenesis-related pathways in melanocytes and hairless mice. However, treatment with low-molecular-weight fish collagen significantly increased the messenger RNA expressions of collagen production-related factors and significantly decreased the production of cytokines. Furthermore, treatment with low-molecular-weight fish collagen suppressed melanogenesis by inhibiting glutathione synthesis and downregulating melanocyte-inducing transcription factor expression through the suppression of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A/cAMP-responsive binding protein signaling and nitric oxide production. Low-molecular-weight fish collagen exerts protective effects against UVB-induced photoaging, through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-melanogenesis activities and could be used for developing effective natural anti-photoaging products.",

      "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ of the human body and has several functions such as barrier against external agents, the maintenance of temperature and homeostatic functions. Skin ageing is a natural process that can be influenced by environmental factors, intrinsic skin factors and lifestyle. UV light plays an important role in skin ageing and can cause spots, requiring the use of depigmenting agents. Nowadays, there is a great demand for ingredients that prevent skin ageing, with natural agents occupying a promising position. Among the natural agents, polyphenols, such as resveratrol and piceatannol, found in grapes, passion fruits and other fruits, have a huge relevance. Great benefits of piceatannol have been reported, so thus, this work focuses specifically on a review of the literature regarding the application of this polyphenol in skin care products. This polyphenol can be used in a wound-healing, or as anti-ageing, antioxidant, anti-acne and skin whitening, among other effects.",

      "abstract": "Lipids are intimately associated with skin condition. This review aims to discuss the function of linoleic acid (LA, 18:2, ω-6), an essential fatty acid, in skin health and hair growth. In skin, LA can be metabolized into ω-6 unsaturated fatty acid, oxidized derivatives and incorporated into complex lipid molecules, including ω-hydroxy-ceramides. Previous research has revealed that skin diseases including acne, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis are associated with disordered LA metabolism. Studies based on animal or skin cell models suggest that LA or LA-rich vegetable oils, topically applied, exhibit diverse biological activities, including the repair of the skin barrier, the promotion of wound healing, skin whitening, photoprotection, anti-inflammatory effects and the stimulation of hair growth. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of LA's beneficial effects on skin are summarized. Further research on the correlation of LA metabolism and skin disorders, a deeper exploration of the mechanisms underlying the function of LA in skin management and more investigations of its clinical application are required to enhance the understanding and utilization of LA in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.",

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of melanin homeostasis is implicated in causing skin pigmentation disorders, such as melasma due to hyperpigmentation and vitiligo due to hypopigmentation. Although the synthesis of melanin has been well studied, the removal of the formed skin pigment requires more research. We determined that β-mangostin, a plant-derived metabolite, induces the degradation of already-formed melanin in the mouse B16F10 cell line. The whitening effect of β-mangostin is mediated by macroautophagy/autophagy, as it was abolished by the knockdown of ATG5 or RB1CC1/FIP200, and by treatment with 3-methyladenine, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex inhibitor. However, the exact autophagy mechanism of melanosome degradation remains unknown. Selective autophagy for a specific cellular organelle requires specific E3-ligases and autophagic receptors for the target organelle. In this study, an E3-ligase, RCHY1, and an autophagy receptor, OPTN (optineurin), were identified as being essential for melanophagy in the β-mangostin-treated B16F10 cell line. As per our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific mechanism for the degradation of melanosomes, the target organelle of melanophagy. These findings are expected to broaden the scope of melanin homeostasis research and can be exploited for the development of therapeutics for skin pigmentation disorders.",

There are increasing evidences that tyrosinase plays a relevant role in the formation and progression of melanoma, a difficult to treat skin tumor. Hydroquinone, azelaic acid and tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) are clinically used in the management of some hyperpigmentations, whereas many novel chemotypes acting as tyrosinase inhibitors with potential antimelanoma action are being investigated. Kojic acid, hydroquinone, its glycosylated derivative arbutin, or the resorcinol derivative rucinol are used in cosmesis in creams as skin whitening agents, whereas no antimelanoma tyrosinase inhibitor reached clinical trials so far, although thiamidol is a recently approved new tyrosinase inhibitor for the treatment of melasma. Kojic acid and vitamin C are used for avoiding vegetable/food oxidative browning due to the tyrosinase-catalyzed reactions, whereas bacterial enzymes show potential in biotechnological applications, for the production of mixed melanins, for protein cross-linking reactions, for producing phenol(s) biosensors, of for the production of L-DOPA, an anti-Parkinson's disease drug.",

      "abstract": "Ultraviolet radiation can heighten tyrosinase activity, stimulate melanocyte production, impede the metabolism of numerous melanocytes, and result in the accumulation of plaques on the skin surface. α-Arbutin, a bioactive substance extracted from the arbutin plant, has been widely used for skin whitening. In this study, the whitening effect of α-arbutin by inhibiting tyrosinase activity and alleviating the photoaging effect induced by UVB are investigated. The results indicate that α-arbutin can inhibit skin inflammation, and its effectiveness is positively correlated with concentration. Moreover, α-arbutin can reduce the skin epidermal thickness, decrease the number of inflammatory cells, and down-regulate the expression levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, which are inflammatory factors. It also promotes the expression of COL-1 collagen, thus playing an important role in anti-inflammatory action. Network pharmacology, metabolomics and transcriptomics further confirm that α-arbutin is related to the L-tyrosine metabolic pathway and may interfere with various signaling pathways related to melanin and other photoaging by regulating metabolic changes. Therefore, α-arbutin has a potential inhibitory effect on UVB-induced photoaging and possesses a whitening effect as a cosmetic compound.",

Thus, their production is increasing in the last decade to produce raw material for cosmetics. In fact, the daily routine includes the use of cosmetics and sunscreens to protect against the environmental changes, mainly the increment of ultraviolet (UV) radiation rate with a consequent skin damage and premature aging due to this overexposure. As it is well discussed, chemical UV filters are extensively incorporated into sunscreens formulas; however, they can induce allergenic reactions as well. For these reasons, some pigments derived from microalgae, such as astaxanthin, lutein, β-carotene as well as other biocompounds are now well described in the literature as well as biotechnologically manufactured as natural ingredients to be incorporated into skin care products with multifunctional benefits even for sunscreen purposes. Hence, this investigation summarizes the recent studies about the main pigments from photosynthetic microorganisms' biomasses as well as their uses in dermocosmetics with novel attributes, such as anti-aging agents, makeups, skin lightening and whitening, among others.",

      "abstract": "Melanin, which is produced by melanocytes and spread over keratinocytes, is responsible for human skin browning. There are several processes involved in melanogenesis, mostly prompted by enzymatic activities. Tyrosinase (TYR), a copper containing metalloenzyme, is considered the main actor in melanin production, as it catalyzes two crucial steps that modify tyrosine residues in dopaquinone. For this reason, TYR inhibition has been exploited as a possible mechanism of modulation of hyper melanogenesis. There are various types of molecules used to block TYR activity, principally used as skin whitening agents in cosmetic products, e.g., tretinoin, hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, arbutin and peptides. Peptides are highly valued for their versatile nature, making them promising candidates for various functions. Their specificity often leads to excellent safety, tolerability, and efficacy in humans, which can be considered their primary advantage over traditional small molecules. There are several examples of tyrosinase inhibitor peptides (TIPs) operating as possible hypo-pigmenting agents, which can be classified according to their origin: natural, hybrid or synthetically produced. Moreover, the possibility of variating their backbones, introducing non-canonical amino acids or modifying one or more peptide bond(s), to obtain peptidomimetic molecules, is an added value to avoid or delay proteolytic activity, while the possibility of conjugation with other bioactive peptides or organic moieties can bring other specific activity leading to dual-functional peptides.",

However, these compounds have physicochemical limitations in terms of its poor solubility and penetration into the cells membrane. Phytosome drug delivery system can be the primary choice to improve the physicochemical properties, which allows increasing the effectiveness. This review aimed to summarize and discuss the phytosome formulations of potential active compounds as skin whitening agent and skin antioxidant, which obtained from Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. We assessed that the main purpose of these phytosome formulations was to improve penetration, stability, and solubility of the active compounds. These studies proved that phytosome formulations can improve the physicochemical characteristics and effectiveness of compounds. The phytosome drug delivery system becomes a promising modification technique for natural compounds due to the ability to improve the physicochemical properties and increase the effectiveness. Phytosome formulation could be the excellent approach for cosmeceutical product with good effectivity in the future.",

      "abstract": "Tyrosinase is an important enzyme in controlling the formation of melanin in melanosome, and plays a key role in the pigmentation of hair and skin. The abnormal expression or activation of tyrosinase is associated with several diseases such as albinism, vitiligo, melanoma and Parkinson disease. Excessive deposition of melanin could cause diseases such as freckles and brown spots in the human body, and it is also closely related to browning of fruits and vegetables and insect molting. Detecting and inhibiting the activity of tyrosinase is of extraordinary value in the progress of diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Therefore, many selective optical detection probes and small molecular inhibitors have been developed, and have made significant contributions to the basic and clinical research on these diseases. In this paper, the detection and inhibition of tyrosinase and their application in whitening products are reviewed, with special emphasis on development of fluorescent probes and inhibitors. Hopefully, this review will help design more efficient and sensitive tyrosinase probes and inhibitors, as well as shed light on novel treatment of diseases such as melanoma.",

      "abstract": "Skin appearance is essential for self-esteem and quality of life; consequently, skin care products represent a huge market. In particular, cosmeceuticals constitute a hybrid category of skin care formulations, at the interphase of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, rationally designed to target (patho) physiological mechanisms aiming to enhance skin health and appearance. Cosmeceuticals are marketed as anti-ageing, anti-wrinkle, hair regrowth, skin whitening and wound healing agents with special emphasis on scar-free healing. An overview on recent cutting-edge advances concerning the discovery and development of enhanced performance cosmeceuticals by drug repositioning approaches is presented here. In this context, we propose \"target repositioning,\" a new term, to highlight that druggable protein targets implicated in multiple diseases (hubs in the diseasome) can be exploited to accelerate the discovery of molecularly targeted cosmeceuticals that can promote skin health as an added benefit, which is a novel concept not described before. In this direction, emphasis is placed on the role of mouse models, for often untreatable skin diseases, as well as recent breakthroughs on monogenic rare skin syndromes, in promoting compound repositioning to innovative cosmeceuticals.",

The triazole ring, which has a broad spectrum of biological action, is of increasing interest in the synthesis of new tyrosinase inhibitors. In this review, tyrosinase inhibition effects, structure-activity relationships, enzyme inhibition kinetics and mechanisms of action of 1,2,3- or 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were investigated. The data gathered is anticipated to supply rational guidance and an influential strategy for the development of novel, potent and safe tyrosinase inhibitors for better practical application in the future.",

      "abstract": "The skin is the most voluminous organ of the human body and is exposed to the outer environment. Such exposed skin suffers from the effects of various intrinsic and extrinsic aging factors. Skin aging is characterized by features such as wrinkling, loss of elasticity, and skin pigmentation. Skin pigmentation occurs in skin aging and is caused by hyper-melanogenesis and oxidative stress. Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is a natural secondary metabolite from a plant-based source widely used as a cosmetic ingredient. We chemically designed and synthesized PCA derivatives conjugated with alkyl esters to develop effective chemicals that have skin-whitening and antioxidant effects and enhance the pharmacological activities of PCA. We identified that melanin biosynthesis in B16 melanoma cells treated with alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) is decreased by PCA derivatives. We also found that PCA derivatives effectively have antioxidant effects in HS68 fibroblast cells. In this study, we suggest that our PCA derivatives are potent ingredients for developing cosmetics with skin-whitening and antioxidant effects.",

      "abstract": "Arbutin, a hydroquinone glucoside, has been detected in ca. 50 plant families, especially in the plants of the Asteraceae, Ericaceae, Proteaceae and Rosaceae families. It is one of the most widely used natural skin-whitening agents. In addition to its skin whitening property, arbutin possesses other therapeutically relevant biological properties, e.g., antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory, as well as anticancer potential. This review presents, for the first time, a comprehensive overview of the distribution of arbutin in the plant kingdom and critically appraises its therapeutic potential as an anticancer agent based on the literature published until the end of August 2022, accessed via several databases, e.g., Web of Science, Science Direct, Dictionary of Natural Products, PubMed and Google Scholar. The keywords used in the search were arbutin, cancer, anticancer, distribution and hydroquinone. Published outputs suggest that arbutin has potential anticancer properties against bladder, bone, brain, breast, cervix, colon, liver, prostate and skin cancers and a low level of acute or chronic toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Cosmetic dermatology preparations such as bleaching agents are ingredients with skin-related biological activities for increasing and improving skin beauty. The possibility of controlling skin hyperpigmentation disorders is one of the most important research goals in cosmetic preparations. Recently, cosmetics containing herbal and botanical ingredients have attracted many interests for consumers of cosmetic products because these preparations are found safer than other preparations with synthetic components. However, high-quality trial studies in larger samples are needed to confirm safety and clinical efficacy of phytotherapeutic agents with high therapeutic index. Arbutin (p-hydroxyphenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside) is a bioactive hydrophilic polyphenol with two isomers including alpha-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-α-glucopyranoside) and β-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-β-glucopyranoside). It is used as a medicinal plant in phytopharmacy. Studies have shown that alpha-arbutin is 10 times more effective than natural arbutin. A comparison of IC50 values showed that α-arbutin (with concentration 2.0 mM) has a more potent inhibitory activity on human tyrosinase against natural arbutin (with higher concentration than 30 mM). A review of recent studies showed that arbutin could be beneficial in treatment of various diseases such as hyperpigmentation disorders, types of cancers, central nervous system disorders, osteoporosis, diabetes, etc. This study was designed to describe the therapeutic efficiencies of arbutin.",

      "abstract": "Melanosomes are melanocyte-specific organelles that protect cells from ultraviolet (UV)-induced deoxyribonucleic acid damage through the production and accumulation of melanin and are transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes. The relatively well-known process by which melanin is synthesized from melanocytes is known as melanogenesis. The relationship between melanogenesis and autophagy is attracting the attention of researchers because proteins associated with autophagy, such as WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, autophagy-related (ATG)7, ATG4, beclin-1, and UV-radiation resistance-associated gene, contribute to the melanogenesis signaling pathway. Additionally, there are reports that some compounds used as whitening cosmetics materials induce skin depigmentation through autophagy. Thus, the possibility that autophagy is involved in the removal of melanin has been suggested. To date, however, there is a lack of data on melanosome autophagy and its underlying mechanism. This review highlights the importance of autophagy in melanin homeostasis by providing an overview of melanogenesis, autophagy, the autophagy machinery involved in melanogenesis, and natural compounds that induce autophagy-mediated depigmentation.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to prepare catechin-loaded transfersomes to enhance drug permeability through topical administration for the skin protection against ultraviolet radiation induced photo-damage. The results showed that the catechin-loaded transfersomes were monodispersed with polydispersity index (PDI) < 0.2, <200 nm in particle size and with high encapsulation efficiency (E.E.%) greater than 85%. The in vitro skin permeation test indicated that the catechin-loaded transfersomes enhanced the skin permeability by 85% compared to the catechin aqueous solution. Similarly, the in-vivo skin whitening study demonstrated that F5 transfersome formulation was effective in tyrosinase inhibition and had good biocompatibility to the guinea pig skin. Finally, the stability study showed that both physicochemical properties and E.E.% of the F5 transferosome formulation were fairly stable after 3 months storage. Therefore, topical administration of catechin-loaded transfersomes could be considered as a potential strategy for the treatment of UV-induced oxidative damage to the skin.",

      "abstract": "Skin ageing is predominantly caused by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors, leading to undesirable skin features. Advancements in both molecular and cellular fields have created possibilities in developing novel stem cell-derived active ingredients for cosmeceutical applications and the beauty industry. Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived secretomes or conditioned media hold great promise for advancing skin repair and regeneration due to the presence of varying cytokines. These cytokines signal our cells and trigger biological mechanisms associated with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-ageing, proliferative and immunomodulatory effects. In this review, we discuss the potential of MSC secretomes as novel biomaterials for skincare and rejuvenation by illustrating their mechanism of action related to wound healing, anti-ageing and whitening properties. The advantages and disadvantages of secretomes are compared with both plant-based and animal-derived extracts. In addition, this paper reviews the current safety standards, regulations, market products and research work related to the cosmeceutical applications of secretomes along with strategies to maintain and improve the therapeutic efficacy and production of secretomes. The future outlook of beauty industry is also presented. Lastly, we highlight significant challenges to be addressed for the clinical realization of MSC secretomes-based skin therapies as well as providing perspectives for the future direction of secretomes.",

      "abstract": "In this study, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was applied to extract bioactive substances with skin-whitening, anti-wrinkle, and antioxidant effects from safflower seeds, and the extraction conditions were optimized by a central composite design. The independent variables, including extraction time (5.0~55.0 min), extraction temperature (26.0~94.0 °C), and ethanol concentration (0.0~100%), were optimized to increase tyrosinase activity inhibitory (TAI), collagenase activity inhibitory (CAI), and radical scavenging activity (RSA), which are indicators of skin-whitening, anti-wrinkle, and antioxidant effects. An extraction time of 26.4 min, extraction temperature of 52.1 °C, and ethanol concentration of 50.7% were found to be optimum conditions of UAE, under which TAI, CAI, and RSA were 53.3%, 91.5%, and 27.7%, respectively. The extract produced by UAE was analyzed by LC-MS/MS, and maleic acid and levulinic acid were identified as the main substances. Therefore, UAE is evaluated as an effective process to extract skin-whitening, anti-wrinkle, and antioxidant substances from safflower seeds at lower temperatures and shorter extraction times compared to the conventional extraction methods. Overall, safflower seeds extract can be used as a material for value-added cosmetics, including maleic acid and levulinic acid, which have bioactive functions.",

      "title": "Natural components in sunscreens: Topical formulations with sun protection factor (SPF).",
      "abstract": "Artificial sunscreens are already gaining traction in order to protect the skin from sunburns, photoaging and photocarcinogenesis. However, the efficacy and safety of most artificial sunscreen constituents are hindered by their photostability, toxicity and damage to marine ecosystems. Natural selection and evolution have ensured that plants and animals have developed effective protective mechanisms against the deleterious side effects of oxidative stress and ultraviolet radiation (UV). Hence, natural antioxidants such as sun blockers are drawing considerable attention. The exact mechanism by which natural components act as sunscreen molecules has not been clearly established. However, conjugated π system is reported to play an important role in protecting the vital genetic material within the organism. Compared to artificial sunscreens, natural sunscreens with strong UV absorptive capacities are largely limited by low specific extinction value and by their inability to spread in large-scale sunscreen cosmetic applications. Previous studies have documented that natural components exert their photoprotective effects (such as improved skin elasticity and hydration, skin texture, and wrinkles) through their antioxidant effects, and through the regulation of UV-induced skin inflammation, barrier impairment and aging. This review focuses on natural antioxidant topical formulations with sun protection factor (SPF). Lignin, melanin, silymarin and other ingredients have been added to high sun protection nature sunscreens without any physical or chemical UV filters. This paper also provides a reference for adopting novel technical measures (extracting high content components, changing the type of solution, optimizing formulation, applying Nano technology, et al) to design and prepare nature sunscreen formulations equated with commercial sunscreen formulations. Another strategy is to add natural antioxidants from plants, animals, microorganisms and marine organisms as special enhancer or modifier ingredients to reinforce SPF values. Although the photoprotective effects of natural components have been established, their deleterious side effects have not been elucidated.",

It is a naturally occurring component of skin, and there is a negligible risk of immunologic or allergic reaction with injection. It is rapidly degraded by the injection of hyaluronidase, thus creating an ideal injectable material that is low risk and reversible.

      "title": "Top weapons in skin aging and actives to target the consequences of skin cell senescence.",
      "abstract": "Skin aging has long been considered a purely cosmetic problem. However, as life expectancy increases, skin aging is taking on a functional dimension that goes beyond cosmetics and appearance. Preventive or therapeutic strategies are needed to target cellular senescence, a key process underlying the alterations in skin function and appearance that occur with aging, as well as to address the age-related skin changes associated with 'dermatoporosis' and chronic skin insufficiency/fragility syndrome. Thus, given the need for effective anti-aging products that improve both the appearance and function of the skin, it is essential to distinguish active ingredients that have been proven to be effective, among the large number of available over-the-counter cosmeceuticals. This brief review focuses on a core group of topical actives, describing their clinical effects on senescence and aging, and their molecular mechanisms of action. These actives include hyaluronic acid, which has hydrating and viscoelastic properties and has been shown to reduce skin atrophy; retinaldehyde, which activates retinoid receptors and increases cutaneous elasticity; vitamins C and E, which provide stable oxidative protection; and niacinamide, which reduces inflammation and mitigates the effects of senescence.",

      "abstract": "Type I collagen is a ubiquitous structural protein in animal tissues. It is normally present in a hydrated form. However, collagen is very dependent on associated water for its mechanical properties. In skin, where type I collagen is dominant, there is a longstanding concern that the skin and therefore collagen may partially dry out and result in structural degradation. Here we show that dehydration of type I collagen fibrils, using 2-propanol, results in a two-stage dehydration process. Initially, the fibrils do not change length, i.e. the D-period remains constant, but shrinkage occurs within the fibrils by an increase in the gap region and a decrease in the overlap region within a D-band and a shortening of the helical turn distance and fibril diameter. Only with further dehydration does the length of the collagen fibril decrease (a decrease in D-period). This mechanism explains why collagen materials are resistant to gross structural change in the early stages of dehydration and shows why they may then suffer from sudden external shrinkage with further dehydration.",

      "abstract": "The skin serves as a critical barrier against external threats-dehydration, ultraviolet exposure, and infections-playing a significant role in internal homeostasis and moisture retention. Additionally, and equally importantly, it interacts dynamically with the complex microbiome resident in it, which is essential for maintaining skin health. Recent interest has focused on the use of probiotics and postbiotics, besides their ability to modulate the skin microbiome, to enhance barrier function, and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, to be involved in skincare, by having the potential to improve skin hydration, elasticity, and overall appearance, as well as in reducing signs of aging, such as wrinkles and fine lines. The products-being a combination of a cosmetic regime plus probiotic[s] or postbiotic[s]-are named cosmeceuticals. However, to comply with the regulations for the characterization of a microorganism as a specific probiotic strain, the pro- or postbiotics incorporated into the cosmetic regime should be both genetically and phenotypically defined. Thus, in this review, we present 14 published clinical trials using such cosmetic products with specific, well-characterized strains of probiotics or postbiotics applied to volunteers with healthy skin. Looking at the results of these studies collectively, we can say that these genetically and phenotypically defined strains of either live or inanimate bacteria and/or their components seem to keep the treated skin at least fully hydrated, with intact epithelial tone, increased radiance, and with decreased wrinkle depth, while normalizing the commensal skin microbiota. Future advancements in personalized skin care may lead to genomic sequencing and metabolomics to tailor probiotic and postbiotic treatments to individual skin microbiomes, promising a new frontier in cosmeceuticals.",

      "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ of our body and plays a protective role against the external environment. The skin functions as a mechanical and water permeability barrier, assisting with thermoregulation and defending our body against a variety of stresses such as ultraviolet radiation, microbial infection, physical injuries, and chemical hazards. The structure of the skin consists of three main layers: the hypodermis, the dermis, and the epidermis. Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of integral membrane proteins whose function is to regulate intracellular fluid hemostasis by facilitating the transportation of water, and in some cases small molecules, across the cell membranes. Up to six different AQPs (AQP1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10) are expressed in a variety of cell types in the skin. The AQP family plays an important role in these various locations, contributing to many key functions of the skin including hydration, wound healing, and immune responses. The involvement of different aquaporin family members in skin is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Ongoing development in cosmetics is increasingly making use of probiotics, which are defined as \"live microorganisms with health-enhancing properties mediated through ingestion or topical application to the host\". The observation that several bacterial strains augment normal processes of healthy tissue maintenance, particularly for the skin, has opened up new avenues for the use of bacterial strains in cosmetics. A principal feature of such \"cosmeceuticals\" is an application of increasing insight into the biochemical nature of the skin's normal microbial flora, also called its microbiome. The opportunity of manipulating the skin microbiome to address various skin disorders has revealed novel routes for treatment. The skin microbiome manipulation approaches to address various skin disorders include skin microbiome transplantation, skin bacteriotherapy, and prebiotic stimulation. Research in this field has revealed that medical outcome-targeted manipulation of skin microbiome bacterial strain makeup may significantly increase skin health and appearance. Commercial availability of probiotic skincare products is rapidly expanding worldwide due to satisfactory laboratory results and public perception of probiotics as being intrinsically more wholesome than other bioactive substances, such as synthetics. Major outcomes of probiotic use include a significant reduction in skin wrinkling, acne and other conditions adversely affecting skin appearance and healthy function. Moreover, probiotics may additionally promote normal skin hydration, resulting in a vibrant and lustrous appearance. Nevertheless, significant technical challenges remain for the full optimization of probiotics in cosmetic products. This article summarizes the evolving nature of this field and explores current probiotic research initiatives, along with regulatory aspects and significant challenges in the manufacturing of cosmetics in the context of market expansion for these products.",

      "abstract": "The growth and demand for cosmeceuticals (cosmetic products that have medicinal or drug-like benefits) have been enhanced for the last few decades. Lately, the newly invented dosage form, i.e., the pharmaceutical-based cosmetic serum has been developed and widely employed in various non-invasive cosmetic procedures. Many pharmaceutical-based cosmetic serums contain natural active components that claim to have a medical or drug-like effect on the skin, hair, and nails, including anti-aging, anti-wrinkle, anti-acne, hydrating, moisturizing, repairing, brightening and lightening skin, anti-hair fall, anti-fungal, and nail growth effect, etc. In comparison with other pharmaceutical-related cosmetic products (creams, gels, foams, and lotions, etc.), pharmaceutical-based cosmetic serums produce more rapid and incredible effects on the skin. This chapter provides detailed knowledge about the different marketed pharmaceutical-based cosmetic serums and their several types such as facial serums, hair serums, nail serums, under the eye serum, lip serum, hand, and foot serum, respectively. Moreover, some valuable procedures have also been discussed which provide prolong effects with desired results in the minimum duration of time after the few sessions of the serum treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers skin aging primarily by disrupting skin barrier function, resulting in dry skin and wrinkle formation. Oyster hydrolysate (OH), as a functional food, has been reported for anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. This study investigated the underlying mechanism of OH effect on UVB-induced skin aging in SKH1 hairless mice. Mice were exposed to UVB three times per week while they were fed with a normal diet or diet containing OH for 10 weeks. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed to investigate the OH effect on human skin moisturizing to evaluate its efficacy and safety. UVB exposure increased parameters of skin aging; dehydration, transepidermal water loss, and macroscopic dorsal skin lesions. OH significantly reduced these features of skin aging. Histological analysis demonstrated that OH decreased skin epidermal and dermal thickness and collagen degradation induced by UVB. OH significantly reduced ROS production, suppressed macrophage activation and neutrophil infiltration, and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. OH improved skin barrier function by increasing the expression of filaggrin, aquaporin-3, and hyaluronic acid synthesis enzymes and promoting recovery from skin damage. Importantly, the results from a human clinical trial demonstrated that OH improved skin moisturization and integrity with no side effects. Taken together, OH supplementation ameliorates skin damage via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and enhances skin hydration and barrier function. OH has a therapeutic potential for skin photoaging.",

      "title": "Non-invasive assessment of skin hydration and sensation with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.",
      "abstract": "The skin is a vital organ in the human body, providing essential functions such as protection, sensation, and metabolism. Skin hydration is one of the crucial factors in maintaining normal skin function. Insufficient skin hydration can lead to dryness, shedding of the stratum corneum, a decrease in skin barrier function, and may cause skin inflammation. Therefore, maintaining or improving skin hydration is critical in promoting healthy skin. Currently, the commonly used method for measuring skin hydration is bioelectrical capacitance analysis, which is often affected by environmental humidity and can only provide limited information. To overcome these limitations, this study used diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) in the wavelength range of 400-1000 nm to quantify skin absorption and scattering modulation caused by changes in skin hydration states. The advantages of this technique include rapid measurements, non-invasiveness, a straightforward optical setup, and suitability for prolonged skin monitoring. We found that DRS-derived skin absorption coefficients had a correlation coefficient of 0.93 with the skin capacitance at various skin hydration states. In addition, our findings reveal that absorption and scattering coefficients may be useful in discerning skin hydration enhancement induced by applying soaked cotton pads or cosmeceutical facial masks, as well as evaluating skin sensation. This study verifies that the DRS method could be a convenient and effective tool for evaluating skin hydration related information.",

      "abstract": "Mask-wearing behavior, common in the post-COVID-19 era, raises concerns for sensitive skin. This split-face study investigated mask-related changes in skin barrier function and microbiome composition among 30 female volunteers with sensitive skin and assessed the mitigating effects of a moisturizer containing biological lipids and probiotics. Skin physiological indicators (transepidermal water loss, erythema index, stratum corneum hydration, pH, temperature) of masked and unmasked areas were collected at baseline, after three hours of mask-wearing, post-tape stripping, and after 24 h, respectively. Microbiome samples collected from the masked areas before and after wearing a medical mask were analyzed with bioinformatics methods. Mask-wearing significantly weakened barrier function in both masked and adjacent unmasked areas, while reducing bacterial diversity. It was also associated with an increase in Cutibacterium (P = 0.110) and decreases in Streptococcus (P = 0.032) and Prevotella (P = 0.026) abundance. Moisturizer application prior to mask-wearing significantly reduced transepidermal water loss and erythema (both P < 0.001) and further improved erythema after 24 h (P = 0.048). These findings demonstrate that mask-wearing can disrupt the skin barrier and microbiome in individuals with sensitive skin and applying a moisturizer beforehand can mitigate mask-related discomforts by aiding barrier repair and reducing sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Dry electrodes offer an accessible continuous acquisition of biopotential signals as part of current in-home monitoring systems but often face challenges of high-contact impedance that results in poor signal quality. The performance of dry electrodes could be affected by electrode material and skin hydration. Herein, we investigate these dependencies using a circuit skin-electrode interface model, varying material and hydration in controlled benchtop experiments on a biomimetic skin phantom simulating dry and hydrated skin. Results of the model demonstrate the contribution of the individual components in the circuit to total impedance and assist in understanding the role of electrode material in the mechanistic principle of dry electrodes. Validation was performed by conducting in vivo skin-electrode contact impedance measurements across ten normative human subjects. Further, the impact of the electrode on biopotential signal quality was evaluated by demonstrating an ability to capture clinically relevant electrocardiogram signals by using dry electrodes integrated into a toilet seat cardiovascular monitoring system. Titanium electrodes resulted in better signal quality than stainless steel electrodes. Results suggest that relative permittivity of native oxide of electrode material come into contact with the skin contributes to the interface impedance, and can lead to enhancement in the capacitive coupling of biopotential signals, especially in dry skin individuals.",

      "abstract": "Although it has been more than 20 years since the first aquaporin was discovered, the specific functions of many aquaporins are still under investigation, because various mice lacking aquaporins have no significant phenotypes. And in many studies, the function of aquaporin is not directly related to its transport function. Therefore, this chapter will focus on some unexpected functions of aquaporins, such the decreased tumor angiogenesis in AQP1 knockout mice, and AQP1 promotes cell migration, possibly by accelerating the water transport in lamellipodia of migrating cells. AQP transports glycerol, and water regulates glycerol content in epidermis and fat, thereby regulating skin hydration/biosynthesis and fat metabolism. AQPs may also be involved in neural signal transduction, cell volume regulation, and organelle physiology. AQP1, AQP3, and AQP5 are also involved in cell proliferation. In addition, AQPs have also been reported to play roles in inflammation in various tissues and organs. The functions of these AQPs may not depend on the permeability of small molecules such as water and glycerol, suggesting AQPs may play more roles in different biological processes in the body.",

      "abstract": "We addressed the damage caused by internal and external factors on the skin, as well as the aging phenomenon caused by delayed repair after damage. We prepared supramolecular hyaluronic acid-ectoin (HA-ECT) by combining theoretical calculations and experimental research, using intermolecular forces between hyaluronic acid and ectoin. This supramolecule has good stability, safety, and skin permeability and can penetrate the stratum corneum of the skin, reaching the epidermis and dermis of the skin. Compared with ectoin, the permeability of the supramolecule HA-ECT was 3.39-fold higher. Supramolecular HA-ECT can promote the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, significantly increase the content of type collagen-I, reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in keratinocytes, and enhance skin hydration and repair effects. HA-ECT can reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species and inhibit the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (reduced by 1.27-fold) to improve skin photoaging. Therefore, supramolecular HA-ECT has potential application in the field of cosmetics for skin antioxidants, anti-aging, and repair.",

Improved understanding of the pathological factors driving skin fibrosis is critical to development of therapeutic modalities. Here, we describe that the Wnt signalling antagonist SFRP2 is upregulated in organotypic keratinocyte cultures upon experimental reduced hydration, a model that simulates the aberrant epidermal barrier state characteristic of several skin pathologies, including those that manifest in development of fibrosis. Consistent with this, we find that SFRP2 is overexpressed in both the dermis and epidermis of human hypertrophic scar tissue and lesional tissue of a mouse scleroderma model. Knockdown of SFRP2 expression in human fibroblasts antagonises proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation, including deposition of type I collagen, suggesting that SFRP2 signalling in fibroblasts may contribute to propagation of fibrosis in hypertrophic scar, as well as in other clinical indications characterised by skin fibrosis.",

      "title": "Protein degradation in the stratum corneum.",
      "abstract": "The stratum corneum (SC), the outermost epidermal layer, plays a pivotal role in skin barrier function. This review delves into the intricate process of protein degradation within the stratum corneum, elucidating the roles of specific enzymes, regulatory mechanisms and the consequent impact on various skin conditions. Protein degradation is a finely tuned process, orchestrated by a suite of proteolytic enzymes like kallikreins. These enzymes are responsible for the breakdown of corneodesmosomes and the orderly desquamation of corneocytes, a process essential for skin homeostasis. Another critical enzymatic process is the breakdown of proteins like filaggrin and the generation of amino acids and their derivatives, required in the physiological water-handling properties of the SC. Regulation of these proteolytic activities is complex, involving a balance between endogenous inhibitors and other factors like pH, hydration and environmental stressors. Dysregulation of protease activity is linked to a spectrum of skin conditions, ranging from xerosis to inflammatory diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. Aberrant protein degradation can lead to compromised skin barrier function, increased tissue water loss and heightened susceptibility to infections and allergens. Understanding the factors affecting protein degradation can inform the development of targeted skincare products. Advances in biochemistry and dermatology have paved the way for the search for active ingredients designed to modulate protease activity. Such innovations may offer promising therapeutic avenues for enhancing skin barrier function and treating skin disorders. This review underscores the significance of enzymatic protein degradation in the SC and its regulatory mechanisms. It provides insights into the pathophysiology of skin diseases and outlines the potential for novel skincare interventions. By bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, this article aims to inspire further investigation for better understanding of skin physiology and innovation in the realm of skincare product development.",

      "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been able to establish itself in recent years not only in academic-scientific, but also in everyday dermatological practice. Its focus lies on epithelial tumors of the skin, which can be diagnosed intuitively and within a few seconds. Thus, basal cell carcinomas, actinic keratoses, and different stages of field cancerization can be diagnosed and monitored for response to therapy or possible recurrence. This often helps to avoid invasive sample extraction. Recently, the field of OCT and its latest advancement, dynamic OCT (D-OCT), has been expanded to include non-oncologic dermatological diseases. This encompasses inflammatory dermatoses and the analysis of physiological skin parameters such as hydration. Thanks to automated vascular imaging and the measurement of objective parameters such as epidermal thickness, blood flow at depth, optical attenuation coefficient, and skin roughness, more and more characteristics of the skin can be studied in a noninvasive and standardized way. New potential areas of application are eczema, contact allergic dermatitis, psoriasis, rosacea, telangiectasia, acute and chronic wounds, melasma and nevus flammeus but also melanocytic lesions.",

      "abstract": "This review covers the last 20 years of research we and our collaborators have conducted on ethnic differences in facial skin moisturization placed in historical context with previous research. We have focussed particularly on the biochemical and cellular gradients of the stratum corneum (SC) with the aim of discovering new skin moisturization and SC maturation mechanisms, identifying new technologies and/or providing conceptual innovations for ingredients that will improve our understanding and treatment of dry skin. Specifically, we discuss gradients for corneodesmosomes and proteases, corneocyte phenotype-inducing enzymes, filaggrin and natural moisturizing factor (NMF), and barrier lipids. These gradients are interdependent and influence greatly corneocyte maturation. The interrelationship between corneodesmolysis and the covalent attachment of ω-hydroxy ceramides and ω-hydroxy fatty acids to the corneocyte protein envelope forming the corneocyte lipid envelope is especially relevant in our new understanding of mechanisms leading to dry skin. This process is initiated by a linoleoyl-ω-acyl ceramide transforming enzyme cascade including 12R lipoxygenase (12R-LOX), epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX3), epoxide hydrolase 3 (EPHX3), short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 9C member 7 (SDR9C7), ceramidase and transglutaminase 1. Our research has opened the opportunity of using novel treatment systems for dry skin based on lipids, humectants, niacinamide and inhibitors of the plasminogen system. It is clear that skin moisturization is a more complex mechanism than simple skin hydration.",

      "title": "Restoring Skin Hydration and Barrier Function: Mechanistic Insights Into Basic Emollients for Xerosis Cutis.",
      "abstract": "Healthy skin is structured to maintain water balance by maximizing water retention and minimizing evaporative loss. The water-holding and barrier functions of the skin can be impaired by several factors that lead to xerosis cutis (dry skin); however, they can also be restored by basic emollients that act through the physicochemical properties of their constituents. This article aims to give a narrative review of the physiology of normal skin hydration, the key pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in dry skin, and the functional effects of basic emollients for managing xerosis cutis. Skin hydration is primarily mediated by the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the epidermis. Hygroscopic compounds in the SC maintain the skin's water-binding capacity, while the intercellular lipid bilayer and outer hydrolipid film prevent evaporative water loss. Xerosis cutis is characterized by a reduction in natural moisturizing factors or hydrolipids in the SC; it may be caused by exogenous triggers (e.g., cold weather, lifestyle, pollution), endogenous factors (e.g., aging, medication use) or genetic predisposition (as seen in atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, ichthyosis), or it may present as a symptom of a systemic disease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism). Regardless of the underlying cause, basic emollients are recommended for the treatment of xerosis cutis and are typically formulated with humectants to improve skin hydration and water-holding capacity (e.g., glycerol, urea, lactic acid) and occludents to restore the epidermal barrier (e.g., petrolatum, liquid paraffin). Basic emollients remain the standard of care for the long-term management of xerosis cutis and diseases associated with dry skin.",

      "abstract": "Dry skin is a common symptom of various conditions, and elderly individuals commonly exhibit this physiological symptom. Dry skin develops owing to sebum deficiency; however, the use of moisturizers can typically overcome this issue, particularly in patients in whom there are no other skin problems. If dry skin is left untreated, itching and eczema can occur, resulting in skin damage. Additionally, hemodialysis patients exhibit reduced barrier function and can experience pain associated with repeated needle insertion; the repeated use of lidocaine tape to manage the pain can cause further skin damage. To reduce the occurrence of dry skin, the skin is hydrated using moisturizers. Dry skin is also prominent in patients with varicose veins in the lower extremities, and many biochemical studies have shown that skin immunity is altered in patients with dry skin. Moreover, the incidences of dry skin and pruritus differ in male and female patients. Furthermore, in elderly patients, zinc deficiency is likely to cause dry skin, and zinc supplementation may maintain skin hydration. To date, few reports have described dry skin from a clinical point of view. In this review, research on dry skin is presented, and the findings of basic research studies are integrated.",

      "abstract": "Ceramide has transitioned from an incidental discovery to a vital element in skincare, becoming a thoroughly studied compound in the quest to treat skin conditions. Creating a moisture barrier, preserving hydration, regulating pH, controlling inflammation, and enhancing skin functions and appearance are among its established benefits. It is often used medically to repair skin barrier defects, as observed in inflammatory skin conditions like atopic dermatitis (AD) and dry skin types. Furthermore, ceramide and its metabolites are commonly used as predictors before disease manifestation and for prognostication processes, thus can be used as biomarker for clinical diagnosis as well. In the last couple of decades, momentum was also seen in the pre-clinical studies involving anti-cancer and nanotechnology field, whereby ceramide was also used as a drug, a carrier, or even adjunct formulation to increase efficacy of treatment such as chemotherapy. Approaches to increase ceramide levels include directly replenishing lost ceramides with natural extracts, synthetic pseudo-ceramides, or ceramide-like analogues, as well as using supplements that stimulate the body's natural ceramide production. Although ceramide is a well-known treatment in skincare and for common skin conditions like AD and psoriasis, its development and related pharmacology for severe skin conditions, such as skin cancer, remain in pre-clinical stages. Hence, the purpose of this research is to explore the role of ceramide in skin health and its application in common skin diseases.",

      "title": "Structure and function of skin barrier lipids: Effects of hydration and natural moisturizers in vitro.",
      "abstract": "Lipid membranes play a crucial role in regulating the body's water balance by adjusting their properties in response to hydration. The intercellular lipid matrix of the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost skin layer, serves as the body's primary defense against environmental factors. Osmolytes, including urocanic acid (UCA) and glycerol, are key components of the natural moisturizing factor that help the SC resist osmotic stress from dry environments. This study examines the effects of UCA and glycerol (each at 5 mol %) on isolated human SC lipids. For this, different techniques were employed, offering complementary information of the system's multiscale characteristics, including humidity-scanning quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, electrical impedance spectroscopy, and studies of water loss and permeability. Our results show that UCA increases water sorption and makes lipid films more liquid-like at high relative humidity, without significantly altering the lipid lamellar structure, chain order, or orthorhombic chain packing. Lipid films containing UCA exhibited higher water loss and significantly higher model drug permeability compared to lipid films without UCA. Further, incorporation of UCA resulted in kinetically faster changes in electrical properties upon contact with aqueous solution compared with control lipids. These observations suggest that UCA reduces lipid cohesion in regions other than the acyl chain-rich leaflets, which may impact SC desquamation. In contrast, glycerol did not influence the hydration or permeability of the SC lipid matrix. However, it increased the proportion of orthorhombic domains at high humidities and slowed the kinetics of the hydration process, as evidenced by slower changes in the dielectric properties of the lipid film. These findings suggest that glycerol enhances lipid cohesion rather than increasing water uptake, which is typically the expected function of humectants. Consequently, UCA and glycerol appear to have distinct roles in maintaining epidermal homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing pressure for innovative methods to treat compromised and difficult-to-heal wounds. Consequently, new strategies are needed for faster healing, reducing infection, hydrating the wound, stimulating healing mechanisms, accelerating wound closure, and reducing scar formation. In this scenario, lectins present as good candidates for healing agents. Lectins are a structurally heterogeneous group of glycosylated or non-glycosylated proteins of non-immune origin, which can recognize at least one specific monosaccharide or oligosaccharide specific for the reversible binding site. Cell surfaces are rich in glycoproteins (glycosidic receptors) that potentially interact with lectins through the number of carbohydrates reached. This lectin-cell interaction is the molecular basis for triggering various changes in biological organisms, including healing mechanisms. In this context, this review aimed to (i) provide a comprehensive overview of relevant research on the potential of vegetable lectins for wound healing and tissue regeneration processes and (ii) discuss future perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Niacinamide (NIA) is widely used in skincare for its favorable safety profile, anti-aging effects, and proven clinical efficacy in treating various skin conditions. However, its direct impact on the hydration and molecular organization of the stratum corneum (SC), the primary skin barrier, remains unclear. This study examines how NIA influences the SC's lipid matrix organization, soft keratin structure, and water sorption behavior across varying relative humidity (RH) levels. Using small- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction and dynamic vapor sorption measurements, we compared NIA-treated SC samples to untreated controls under different RHs. The main findings show that while NIA is non-hygroscopic, it enhances water uptake of the SC at high humidity (95% RH). At low humidity (60% RH), NIA swells the keratin monomer spacing, although the SC water content remains low, suggesting a plasticizing effect that could increase SC flexibility in dry conditions. NIA also modifies the diffraction intensities from the lipid matrix differently at 60% and 95% RH, implying that it interacts with the SC lipid matrix and influences the water distribution within the SC lipid and protein domains. These effects appear independent of the investigated dose regime, indicating a specific concentration threshold. Overall, NIA shows distinct interaction with keratin, swelling the spacing between keratin monomers in dry conditions, without acting as a traditional keratolytic agent.",

      "title": "A green-based approach for noninvasive skin rejuvenation: Potential application of hyaluronic acid.",
      "abstract": "Gradually, loss of skin elasticity and elastic properties occurs after 30 years of age and will be associated with several changes, including creating wrinkles, skin laxity (sagging skin), and skin blemishes. In general, people all over the world are looking for ways to keep their facial skin young over time. There are several strategies to skin rejuvenate, including invasive and non-invasive methods. However, invasive methods have less popularity than non-invasive methods due to their need for specialist physicians (medical expertise), localized neuropathic pains for patients, the prevalence and incidence of skin infections, and high-cost clinical services. In the meantime, skin hydration is one of the simplest non-invasive methods for skin rejuvenation, and HA, with anti-aging and skin collagen-stimulating properties, has been introduced as a natural skin moisturizing agent. Therefore, since this composition maintains facial skin moisture and radiance, and improves its elasticity, it has always been considered by experts and specialist physicians. On the other hand, due to its lipophilic properties, hydrophilic macromolecules containing HA cannot pass through the stratum corneum. However, they have temporary and superficial softening effects on the skin. Hence, some nanocarriers have been suggested to overcome this problem and develop the properties and positive influences of HA on skin rejuvenation. Therefore, the present study aimed to introduce some new non-invasive approaches in facial skin rejuvenation, including applying liposomes, niosomes, ethosomes, and ionic liquids, to transport HA into the inner and deeper layers of the skin, including Dermis. In this review article, we examine non-invasive methods using nanoparticles to deliver HA to the epidermis and dermis of the skin for skin rejuvenation.",

      "title": "Biomechanical and biochemical changes in murine skin during development and aging.",
      "abstract": "Aging leads to biochemical and biomechanical changes in skin, with biological and functional consequences. Despite extensive literature on skin aging, there is a lack of studies which investigate the maturation of the tissue and connect the microscopic changes in the skin to its macroscopic biomechanical behavior as it evolves over time. The present work addresses this knowledge gap using multiscale characterization of skin in a murine model considering newborn, adult and aged mice. Monotonic uniaxial loading, tension relaxation with change of bath, and loading to failure tests were performed on murine skin samples from different age groups, complemented by inflation experiments and atomic force microscopy indentation measurements. In parallel, skin samples were characterized using histological and biochemical techniques to assess tissue morphology, collagen organization, as well as collagen content and cross-linking. We show that 1-week-old skin differs across nearly all measured parameters from adult skin, showing reduced strain stiffening and tensile strength, a thinner dermis, lower collagen content and altered crosslinking patterns. Surprisingly, adult and aged skin were similar across most biomechanical parameters in the physiologic loading range, while aged skin had lower tensile strength and lower stiffening behavior at large force values. This correlates with altered collagen content and cross-links. Based on a computational model, differences in mechanocoupled stimuli in the skin of the different age groups were calculated, pointing to a potential biological significance of the age-induced biomechanical changes in regulating the local biophysical environment of dermal cells. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Skin microstructure and the emerging mechanical properties change with age, leading to biological, functional and health-related consequences. Despite extensive literature on skin aging, only very limited quantitative data are available on microstructural changes and the corresponding macroscopic biomechanical behavior as they evolve over time. This work provides a wide-range multiscale mechanical characterization of skin of newborn, adult and aged mice, and quantifies microstructural correlations in tissue morphology, collagen content, organization and cross-linking. Remarkably, aged skin retained normal hydration and normal biomechanical function in the physiological loading range but showed significantly reduced properties at super-physiological loading. Our data show that age-related microstructural differences have a profound effect not only on tissue-level properties but also on the cell-level biophysical environment.",

      "abstract": "Skin is easily accessible for transdermal drug delivery and also attractive for biomarker sampling. These applications are strongly influenced by hydration where elevated hydration generally leads to increased skin permeability. Thus, favorable transdermal delivery and extraction conditions can be easily obtained by exploiting elevated skin hydration. Here, we provide a detailed in vivo and in vitro investigation of the skin hydration dynamics using three techniques based on electrical impedance spectroscopy. Good correlation between in vivo and in vitro results is demonstrated, which implies that simple but realistic in vitro models can be used for further studies related to skin hydration (e.g., cosmetic testing). Importantly, the results show that hydration proceeds in two stages. Firstly, hydration between 5 and 10 min results in a drastic skin impedance change, which is interpreted as filling of superficial voids in skin with conducting electrolyte solution. Secondly, a subtle impedance change is observed over time, which is interpreted as leveling of the water gradient across skin leading to structural relaxation/changes of the macromolecular skin barrier components. With respect to transdermal drug delivery and extraction of biomarkers; 1 h of hydration is suggested to result in beneficial and stable conditions in terms of high skin permeability and extraction efficiency.",

Here we highlight recent advances in our understanding of how the microbiota mediates multiple facets of skin barrier function. We discuss recent insights into pathological host-microbiota interactions and implications for disorders of the skin and distant organs. Finally, we examine how microbiota-based mechanisms can be targeted to prevent or manage skin disorders and impaired wound healing.",

The skin barrier, the elastic and mechanical properties of the cutaneous tissue as well as its vascular reactivity are impacted by aging. The barrier dysfunction in aged skin is caused by defects in epidermal keratinocytes renewal and differentiation notably linked to abnormal expression of microRNAs regulating cell death and autophagy. An abnormal balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins modifies the mechanical properties of the dermis in aged skin. Finally, a reduction of the vascular reactivity linked to endothelial dysfunctions is observed in elderly people. These biological processes can be targeted by therapeutic approaches either topical or systemic, especially using anti-oxydants or senolytics. These anti-aging strategies might contribute to restore, at least in part, the functional integrity of aged skin.",

This is primarily attributed to the decline of epidermal stem cells and the loss of dermal collagen, which is the most abundant protein in the human body. Age-related alterations of the epidermis and dermis impair skin structure/function and create a tissue microenvironment that promotes age-related skin diseases, such as impaired skin barrier, delayed wound healing, and skin cancer development.

      "abstract": "Burns and their treatment are a significant medical problem. The loss of the physical barrier function of the skin opens the door to microbial invasion and can lead to infection. The repair process of the damage caused by the burn is impaired due to the enhanced loss of fluids and minerals through the burn wound, the onset of hypermetabolism with the concomitant disruption of nutrient supply, and derangements in the endocrine system. In addition, the initiated inflammatory and free radical processes drive the progression of oxidative stress, the inhibition of which largely depends on an adequate supply of antioxidants and minerals. Clinical experience and research provide more and more data to make the treatment of patients with thermal injury increasingly effective. The publication discusses disorders occurring in patients after thermal injury and the methods used at various stages of treatment.",

      "abstract": "A compromised permeability barrier is a hallmark of atopic dermatitis (AD). Localized to the outermost skin layer, the stratum corneum (SC) is critically dependent on terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes, which transform into protein-rich corneocytes surrounded by extracellular lamellae of unique epidermal lipids, conferring permeability barrier function. These structures are disrupted in AD. A leaky barrier is prone to environmental insult, which in AD elicits type 2-dominant inflammation, in turn resulting in a vicious cycle further impairing the SC structure. Therapies directed at enforcing SC structure and anti-inflammatory strategies administered by topical and systemic route as well as UV therapy have differential effects on the permeability barrier. The expanding armamentarium of therapeutic modalities for AD treatment warrants optimization of their effects on permeability barrier function.",

      "abstract": "Naturally occurring peptides found in the human skin can serve particular biological activities and play roles as signaling molecules of various physiological processes such as homeostasis, growth, defense or immunity. Their great biological activity resulted in a growing interest in the pharmaceutical industry. Researchers consider peptides either promising compounds with potential application for human diagnosis, therapy or cosmetics. Peptides are becoming interesting cosmetic ingredients with the functions to reduce premature skin aging, improve the barrier function of skin, moisturize the skin, protect it from UV damage, and anti-inflammatory properties that alleviate acne and irritation. Till now, peptides of different origins were investigated in formulation developed to enhance collagen or elastin production, increase fibroblast proliferation, improve wound healing or skin condition. Most of them are obtained by chemical synthesis or by partial digestion of animal proteins. Short and easily synthesized peptides with alternative amino acid sequence, and combinations have created a new field of molecules inspired by nature and implemented in the cosmetic industry. Nowadays, peptides are cheaper and easier to produce in large quantities. The efficient process development methods allow obtaining nearly unlimited sequences, which makes them functionally preferred. Generally, cosmetic peptides are categorized as carrier peptides, neurotransmitter- affecting peptides, enzyme inhibitor peptides and signal peptides. The use of signal peptides in cosmetics increased over a few years. These molecules trigger a signaling cascade and stimulate fibroblast collagen production, the proliferation of elastin, fibronectin, laminin, etc. Thus, a literature search on a topical application of the most common signal peptides; and their current status in the cosmetic industry was carried out.",

These two systems interact cooperatively to maintain skin homeostasis and overall human health. However, if dysregulated, several skin diseases may arise. Psoriasis is one of the most prevalent skin diseases associated with disrupted barrier function. It is characterised by the formation of psoriatic lesions, the aberrant differentiation and proliferation of keratinocytes, and excessive inflammation. In this review, we summarize recent discoveries in disease pathogenesis, including the contribution of keratinocytes, immune cells, genetic and environmental factors, and how they advance current and future treatments.",

      "abstract": "The barrier function of the skin is primarily located in the stratum corneum (SC), the outermost layer of the skin. The SC is composed of dead cells with highly organized lipid lamellae in the intercellular space. As the lipid matrix forms the only continuous pathway, the lipids play an important role in the permeation of compounds through the SC. The main lipid classes are ceramides (CERs), cholesterol (CHOL) and free fatty acids (FFAs). Analysis of the SC lipid matrix is of crucial importance in understanding the skin barrier function, not only in healthy skin, but also in inflammatory skin diseases with an impaired skin barrier. In this review we provide i) a historical overview of the steps undertaken to obtain information on the lipid composition and organization in SC of healthy skin and inflammatory skin diseases, ii) information on the role CERs, CHOL and FFAs play in the lipid phase behavior of very complex lipid model systems and how this knowledge can be used to understand the deviation in lipid phase behavior in inflammatory skin diseases, iii) knowledge on the role of both, CER subclasses and chain length distribution, on lipid organization and lipid membrane permeability in complex and simple model systems with synthetic CERs, CHOL and FFAs, iv) similarity in lipid phase behavior in SC of different species and complex model systems, and vi) future directions in modulating lipid composition that is expected to improve the skin barrier in inflammatory skin diseases.",

Cooperation between the microbiota, host skin cells, and the immune system is responsible for maintenance of skin health, and a disruption to this delicate balance, such as by pathogen invasion or a breach in the skin barrier, may lead to impaired skin function. In this minireview, we describe the role of the microbiome in microbe, host, and immune interactions under distinct skin states, including homeostasis, tissue repair, and wound infection. Furthermore, we highlight the growing number of diverse microbial metabolites and products that have been identified to mediate these interactions, particularly those involved in host-microbe communication and defensive symbiosis.

      "title": "Overcoming skin barriers through advanced transdermal drug delivery approaches.",
      "abstract": "Upon exhaustive research, the transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) has appeared as a potential, well-accepted, and popular approach to a novel drug delivery system. Ease of administration, easy handling, minimum systemic exposure, least discomfort, broad flexibility and tunability, controlled release, prolonged therapeutic effect, and many more perks make it a promising approach for effective drug delivery. Although, the primary challenge associated is poor skin permeability. Skin is an intact barrier that serves as a primary defense mechanism to preclude any foreign particle's entry into the body. Owing to the unique anatomical framework, i.e., compact packing of stratum corneum with tight junction and fast anti-inflammatory responses, etc., emerged as a critical physiological barrier for TDDS. Fusion with other novel approaches like nanocarriers, specially designed transdermal delivery devices, permeation enhancers, etc., can overcome the limitations. Utilizing such strategies, some of the products are under clinical trials, and many are under investigation. This review explores all dimensions that overcome poor permeability and allows the drug to attain maximum potential. The article initially compiles fundamental features, components, and design of TDDS, followed by critical aspects and various methods, including in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo methods of assessing skin permeability. The work primarily aimed to highlight the recent advancement in novel strategies for effective transdermal drug delivery utilizing active methods like iontophoresis, electroporation, sonophoresis, microneedle, needleless jet injection, etc., and passive methods such as the use of liposomes, SLN, NLC, micro/nanoemulsions, dendrimers, transferosomes, and many more nanocarriers. In all, this compilation will provide a recent insight on the novel updates along with basic concepts, the current status of clinical development, and challenges for the clinical translation of TDDS.",

      "abstract": "Aging clocks are predictive models of biological age derived from age-related changes, such as epigenetic changes, blood biomarkers, and, more recently, the microbiome. Gut and skin microbiota regulate more than barrier and immune function. Recent studies have shown that human microbiomes may predict aging. In this narrative review, we aim to discuss how the gut and skin microbiomes influence aging clocks as well as clarify the distinction between chronological and biological age. A literature search was performed on PubMed/MEDLINE databases with the following keywords: \"skin microbiome\" OR \"gut microbiome\" AND \"aging clock\" OR \"epigenetic\". Gut and skin microbiomes may be utilized to create aging clocks based on taxonomy, biodiversity, and functionality. The top contributing microbiota or metabolic pathways in these aging clocks may influence aging clock predictions and biological age. Furthermore, gut and skin microbiota may directly and indirectly influence aging clocks through the regulation of clock genes and the production of metabolites that serve as substrates or enzymatic regulators. Microbiome-based aging clock models may have therapeutic potential. However, more research is needed to advance our understanding of the role of microbiota in aging clocks.",

The AHR modulates various physiological functions by acting as a sensor that mediates environment-cell interactions, particularly during immune and inflammatory responses. Diverse experimental systems have been used to assess the AHR's role in skin inflammation, including in vitro assays of keratinocyte stimulation and murine models of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Similar approaches have addressed the role of AHR ligands, e.g., TCDD, FICZ, and microbiota-derived metabolites, in skin homeostasis and pathology. Tapinarof is a novel AHR-modulating agent that inhibits skin inflammation and enhances skin barrier function. The topical application of tapinarof is being evaluated in clinical trials to treat psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

      "abstract": "Following the advent of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), subsequent unintended effects such as accelerated facial aging and altered skin health have been noted. This review delves deeper into the causative underlying mechanisms and provides insights into the intricate relationship between GLP-1RAs, adipose tissue, and premature facial aging, thereby highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of their effects on facial alterations and skin health. Studies exploring the potential effects of GLP-1RAs on facial alterations and offering insights into the possible underlying mechanisms, causes, and clinical implications were included. The accelerated facial aging and altered skin health observed in GLP-1RA patients appears to be multifactorial, involving loss of dermal and subcutaneous white adipose tissue, and altered proliferation and differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), and impacts on the production and secretion of hormonal and metabolic factors. These changes compromise the structural integrity and barrier function of the skin and may lead to diminished facial muscle mass, further exacerbating the appearance of aging. The insights presented call for a paradigm shift in the clinical management of facial changes induced by GLP-1RAs, with a focus on treatment strategies aimed at targeting ADSC stimulation. These include autologous fat transfers to reintroduce cells rich in ADSCs for rejuvenation, composite fat grafting combining autologous fat with/without stromal vascular fraction, and the strategic use of soft tissue fillers for volume restoration and biostimulation. This review highlights the potential role of GLP-1RAs in modulating adipose tissue dynamics, thereby contributing to accelerated aging through metabolic, structural, and hormonal pathways.",

      "abstract": "The epidermis forms a barrier that defends the body from desiccation and entry of harmful substances, while also sensing and integrating environmental signals. The tightly orchestrated cellular changes needed for the formation and maintenance of this epidermal barrier occur in the context of the skin microbiome. Using germ-free mice, we demonstrate the microbiota is necessary for proper differentiation and repair of the epidermal barrier. These effects are mediated by microbiota signaling through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) in keratinocytes, a xenobiotic receptor also implicated in epidermal differentiation. Mice lacking keratinocyte AHR are more susceptible to barrier damage and infection, during steady-state and epicutaneous sensitization. Colonization with a defined consortium of human skin isolates restored barrier competence in an AHR-dependent manner. We reveal a fundamental mechanism whereby the microbiota regulates skin barrier formation and repair, which has far-reaching implications for the numerous skin disorders characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction.",

      "title": "The role of ceramides in skin barrier function and the importance of their correct formulation for skincare applications.",
      "abstract": "Ceramides are a family of lipids constituted by a sphingoid base and a fatty acid. In the skin, they are mainly present in the stratum corneum where, with cholesterol and free fatty acids, they constitute the inter-corneocyte lipids. With the other lipid groups, they play a key role in the formation of dense lamellar structures between adjacent corneocytes, collectively ensuring the vital efficient barrier to water evaporation and protection from foreign agents´ penetration. Changes in ceramide level and relative composition, with potential impairment of lipid arrangement, have been evidenced in different skin conditions and skin diseases. Therefore, use of suitably formulated ceramides has been proposed for topical treatment to help re-structure damaged lipid arrangement and repair impaired skin barrier function. Nonetheless, the formulation of ceramides in products necessitates specific processes such as heating to high temperature before their introduction in the final formula. In this review on the structure, the role and the potential of ceramides for skincare, we point out the necessity of rigorous process when formulating ceramides into the final product. We demonstrate the counterproductive effects of undissolved ceramides on skin barrier repair capacity of the formulas, when assessed in different in vitro models of disrupted skin barrier.",

      "abstract": "Effective reprogramming of chronic wound healing remains challenging due to the limited drug delivery efficacy hindered by physiological barriers, as well as the inappropriate dosing timing in distinct healing stages. Herein, a core-shell structured microneedle array patch with programmed functions (PF-MNs) is designed to dynamically modulate the wound immune microenvironment according to the varied healing phases. Specifically, PF-MNs combat multidrug-resistant bacterial biofilm at the early stage via generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) under laser irradiation. Subsequently, the ROS-sensitive MN shell gradually degrades to expose the MN core component, which neutralizes various inflammatory factors and promotes the phase transition from inflammation to proliferation. In addition, the released verteporfin inhibits scar formation by blocking Engrailed-1 (En1) activation in fibroblasts. Our experiments demonstrate that PF-MNs promote scarless wound repair in mouse models of both acute and chronic wounds, and inhibit the formation of hypertrophic scar in rabbit ear models.",

      "title": "Bioactive lipids in the skin barrier mediate its functionality in health and disease.",
      "abstract": "Our skin protects us from external threats including ultraviolet radiation, pathogens and chemicals, and prevents excessive trans-epidermal water loss. These varied activities are reliant on a vast array of lipids, many of which are unique to skin, and that support physical, microbiological and immunological barriers. The cutaneous physical barrier is dependent on a specific lipid matrix that surrounds terminally-differentiated keratinocytes in the stratum corneum. Sebum- and keratinocyte-derived lipids cover the skin's surface and support and regulate the skin microbiota. Meanwhile, lipids signal between resident and infiltrating cutaneous immune cells, driving inflammation and its resolution in response to pathogens and other threats. Lipids of particular importance include ceramides, which are crucial for stratum corneum lipid matrix formation and therefore physical barrier functionality, fatty acids, which contribute to the acidic pH of the skin surface and regulate the microbiota, as well as the stratum corneum lipid matrix, and bioactive metabolites of these fatty acids, involved in cell signalling, inflammation, and numerous other cutaneous processes. These diverse and complex lipids maintain homeostasis in healthy skin, and are implicated in many cutaneous diseases, as well as unrelated systemic conditions with skin manifestations, and processes such as ageing. Lipids also contribute to the gut-skin axis, signalling between the two barrier sites. Therefore, skin lipids provide a valuable resource for exploration of healthy cutaneous processes, local and systemic disease development and progression, and accessible biomarker discovery for systemic disease, as well as an opportunity to fully understand the relationship between the host and the skin microbiota. Investigation of skin lipids could provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and help identify new targets for interventions. Development and improvement of existing in vitro and in silico approaches to explore the cutaneous lipidome, as well as advances in skin lipidomics technologies, will facilitate ongoing progress in skin lipid research.",

      "abstract": "The skin, which is comprised of the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, is the largest organ in the human body and it plays a crucial role in the regulation of the body's homeostasis. These functions are regulated by local neuroendocrine and immune systems with a plethora of signaling molecules produced by resident and immune cells. In addition, neurotransmitters, endocrine factors, neuropeptides, and cytokines released from nerve endings play a central role in the skin's responses to stress. These molecules act on the corresponding receptors in an intra-, juxta-, para-, or autocrine fashion. The epidermis as the outer most component of skin forms a barrier directly protecting against environmental stressors. This protection is assured by an intrinsic keratinocyte differentiation program, pigmentary system, and local nervous, immune, endocrine, and microbiome elements. These constituents communicate cross-functionally among themselves and with corresponding systems in the dermis and hypodermis to secure the basic epidermal functions to maintain local (skin) and global (systemic) homeostasis. The neurohormonal mediators and cytokines used in these communications regulate physiological skin functions separately or in concert. Disturbances in the functions in these systems lead to cutaneous pathology that includes inflammatory (i.e., psoriasis, allergic, or atopic dermatitis, etc.) and keratinocytic hyperproliferative disorders (i.e., seborrheic and solar keratoses), dysfunction of adnexal structure (i.e., hair follicles, eccrine, and sebaceous glands), hypersensitivity reactions, pigmentary disorders (vitiligo, melasma, and hypo- or hyperpigmentary responses), premature aging, and malignancies (melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers). These cellular, molecular, and neural components preserve skin integrity and protect against skin pathologies and can act as \"messengers of the skin\" to the central organs, all to preserve organismal survival.",

The mechanisms underlying epithelial barrier dysfunction in allergic and inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, food allergy, eosinophilic oesophagitis, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, and asthma, are complex and influenced by the exposome, microbiome, individual genetics, and epigenetics. Here, we review the role of the epithelial barriers of the skin, digestive tract, and airways in maintaining homeostasis, how they influence the occurrence and progression of allergic and inflammatory conditions, how current treatments target the epithelium to improve symptoms of these disorders, and what the unmet needs are in the identification and treatment of epithelial disorders.",

      "title": "Radiation Dermatitis: Radiation-Induced Effects on the Structural and Immunological Barrier Function of the Epidermis.",
      "abstract": "An important hallmark of radiation dermatitis is the impairment of the mitotic ability of the stem/progenitor cells in the basal cell layers due to radiation-induced DNA damage, leading to suppressed cell renewal in the epidermis. However, this mechanism alone does not adequately explain the complex pathogenesis of radiation-induced skin injury. In this review, we summarize the latest findings on the complex pathogenesis of radiation dermatitis and correlate these with the clinical features of radiation-induced skin reactions. The current studies show that skin exposure to ionizing radiation induces cellular senescence in the epidermal keratinocytes. As part of their epithelial stress response, these senescent keratinocytes secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, thereby triggering skin inflammation. Keratinocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines modulate intercellular communication with the immune cells, activating skin-resident and recruiting skin-infiltrating immune cells within the epidermis and dermis, thereby orchestrating the inflammatory response to radiation-induced tissue damage. The increased expression of specific chemoattractant chemokines leads to increased recruitment of neutrophils into the irradiated skin, where they release cytotoxic granules that are responsible for the exacerbation of an inflammatory state. Moreover, the importance of IL-17-expressing γδ-T cells to the radiation-induced hyperproliferation of keratinocytes was demonstrated, leading to reactive hyperplasia of the epidermis. Radiation-induced, reactive hyperproliferation of the keratinocytes disturbs the fine-tuned keratinization and cornification processes, leading to structural dysfunction of the epidermal barrier. In summary, in response to ionizing radiation, epidermal keratinocytes have important structural and immunoregulatory barrier functions in the skin, coordinating interacting immune responses to eliminate radiation-induced damage and to initiate the healing process.",

      "abstract": "This review explores the emerging term \"gut-skin axis\" (GSA), describing the bidirectional signaling that occurs between the skin and the gastrointestinal tract under both homeostatic and disease conditions. Central to GSA communication are the gut and skin microbiota, the microbial communities that colonize these barrier surfaces. By influencing diverse host pathways, including innate immune, vitamin D receptor, and Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, a balanced microbiota contributes to both tissue homeostasis and host defense. In contrast, microbiota imbalance, or dysbiosis at one site, can lead to local barrier dysfunction, resulting in the activation of signaling pathways that can disrupt tissue homeostasis at the other site, potentially leading to inflammatory skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, or gut diseases like Inflammatory Bowel Disease. To date, most research on the GSA has examined the impact of the gut microbiota and diet on skin health, but recent studies show that exposing the skin to ultraviolet B-light can beneficially modulate both the gut microbiome and intestinal health. Thus, despite the traditional focus of clinicians and researchers on these organ systems as distinct, the GSA offers new opportunities to better understand the pathogenesis of cutaneous and gastrointestinal diseases and promote health at both sites.",

      "abstract": "The skin serves as a critical barrier against external threats-dehydration, ultraviolet exposure, and infections-playing a significant role in internal homeostasis and moisture retention. Additionally, and equally importantly, it interacts dynamically with the complex microbiome resident in it, which is essential for maintaining skin health. Recent interest has focused on the use of probiotics and postbiotics, besides their ability to modulate the skin microbiome, to enhance barrier function, and exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, to be involved in skincare, by having the potential to improve skin hydration, elasticity, and overall appearance, as well as in reducing signs of aging, such as wrinkles and fine lines. The products-being a combination of a cosmetic regime plus probiotic[s] or postbiotic[s]-are named cosmeceuticals. However, to comply with the regulations for the characterization of a microorganism as a specific probiotic strain, the pro- or postbiotics incorporated into the cosmetic regime should be both genetically and phenotypically defined. Thus, in this review, we present 14 published clinical trials using such cosmetic products with specific, well-characterized strains of probiotics or postbiotics applied to volunteers with healthy skin. Looking at the results of these studies collectively, we can say that these genetically and phenotypically defined strains of either live or inanimate bacteria and/or their components seem to keep the treated skin at least fully hydrated, with intact epithelial tone, increased radiance, and with decreased wrinkle depth, while normalizing the commensal skin microbiota. Future advancements in personalized skin care may lead to genomic sequencing and metabolomics to tailor probiotic and postbiotic treatments to individual skin microbiomes, promising a new frontier in cosmeceuticals.",

The main cutaneous collagens are types I and III, which are less synthesized with aging. Vit C is one of the main promotors of collagen formation but it poorly bypasses the epidermis stratum corneum barrier. To address this challenge, we developed a lipophilic version of Vit C for improving skin diffusion and delivery. Vit C was covalently conjugated to squalene (SQ), a natural lipid of the skin, forming a novel Vit C-SQ derivative suitable for cream formulation. Its biological activity was investigated on human whole skin explants in an ex vivo model, through histology and protein and gene expression analyses. Results were compared to Vit C coupled to the reference lipophilic compound palmitic acid, (Vit C-Palmitate). It was observed that Vit C-SQ significantly increased epidermal thickness and preferentially favored collagen III production in human skin after application for 10 days. It also promoted glycosaminoglycans production in a higher extent comparatively to Vit C-Palmitate and free Vit C. Microdissection of the explants to separate dermis and epidermis allowed to measure higher transcriptional effects either in epidermis or in dermis. Among the formulations studied, the strongest effects were observed with Vit C-SQ.",

      "abstract": "Our skin provides a protective barrier that shields us from our environment. Barrier function is typically associated with the interfollicular epidermis; however, whether hair follicles influence this process remains unclear. Here, we utilize a potent genetic tool to probe barrier function by conditionally ablating a quintessential epidermal barrier gene, Abca12, which is mutated in the most severe skin barrier disease, harlequin ichthyosis. With this tool, we deduced 4 ways by which hair follicles modulate skin barrier function. First, the upper hair follicle (uHF) forms a functioning barrier. Second, barrier disruption in the uHF elicits non-cell-autonomous responses in the epidermis. Third, deleting Abca12 in the uHF impairs desquamation and blocks sebum release. Finally, barrier perturbation causes uHF cells to move into the epidermis. Neutralizing IL-17a, whose expression is enriched in the uHF, partially alleviated some disease phenotypes. Altogether, our findings implicate hair follicles as multi-faceted regulators of skin barrier function.",

      "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) exposure triggers skin aging primarily by disrupting skin barrier function, resulting in dry skin and wrinkle formation. Oyster hydrolysate (OH), as a functional food, has been reported for anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic effects. This study investigated the underlying mechanism of OH effect on UVB-induced skin aging in SKH1 hairless mice. Mice were exposed to UVB three times per week while they were fed with a normal diet or diet containing OH for 10 weeks. Additionally, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial was performed to investigate the OH effect on human skin moisturizing to evaluate its efficacy and safety. UVB exposure increased parameters of skin aging; dehydration, transepidermal water loss, and macroscopic dorsal skin lesions. OH significantly reduced these features of skin aging. Histological analysis demonstrated that OH decreased skin epidermal and dermal thickness and collagen degradation induced by UVB. OH significantly reduced ROS production, suppressed macrophage activation and neutrophil infiltration, and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production. OH improved skin barrier function by increasing the expression of filaggrin, aquaporin-3, and hyaluronic acid synthesis enzymes and promoting recovery from skin damage. Importantly, the results from a human clinical trial demonstrated that OH improved skin moisturization and integrity with no side effects. Taken together, OH supplementation ameliorates skin damage via anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and enhances skin hydration and barrier function. OH has a therapeutic potential for skin photoaging.",

      "title": "Recombinant filaggrin-2 improves skin barrier function and attenuates ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation-induced epidermal barrier disruption.",
      "abstract": "The integrity of the skin barrier is essential for maintaining skin health, with the stratum corneum and filaggrin 2 (FLG-2) playing a key role. FLG-2 deficiency or mutation has been linked to diseases such as atopic dermatitis, while external stressors such as ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation further damage the epidermal barrier. This study investigated the effects of recombinant filaggrin (rFLG) on skin barrier function and UVB induced epidermal destruction. Cell experiments showed that 10 μg/mL of rFLG could increase the mobility of HaCaT cells from 20 % to 42 %, increase the epithelial resistance (TEER) value by about 2 times, and up-regulate the tight junction associated protein by about 2 times. In mouse models of UVB-induced epidermal barrier destruction, rFLG at concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL showed effective cell uptake and skin penetration, alleviating erythema, and reducing skin thickness in mice by 1.5-3 times. Among them, 2 mg/mL of rFLG treatment restored the expression of tight junction proteins (LOR, ZO-1, and caspase-14), reduced collagen degradation, and reduced oxidative stress by normalizing serum hydroxyproline and superoxide dismutase levels. In addition, 2 mg/mL of rFLG inhibited UVB-induced upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-3 and MMP-9) and reduced pro-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1α, IL-6, and TNF-α) and apoptotic markers (P38, Bax, and Bcl-2) to normal levels. These findings suggested that rFLG effectively enhanced skin barrier integrity and mitigated UVB-induced epidermal barrier destruction, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with skin barrier dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "The epithelial tissues that line our body, such as the skin and gut, have remarkable regenerative prowess and continually renew throughout our lifetimes. Owing to their barrier function, these tissues have also evolved sophisticated repair mechanisms to swiftly heal and limit the penetration of harmful agents following injury. Researchers now appreciate that epithelial regeneration and repair are not autonomous processes but rely on a dynamic cross talk with immunity. A wealth of clinical and experimental data point to the functional coupling of reparative and inflammatory responses as two sides of the same coin. Here we bring to the fore the immunological signals that underlie homeostatic epithelial regeneration and restitution following damage. We review our current understanding of how immune cells contribute to distinct phases of repair. When unchecked, immune-mediated repair programs are co-opted to fuel epithelial pathologies such as cancer, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Thus, understanding the reparative functions of immunity may advance therapeutic innovation in regenerative medicine and epithelial inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines are important contributors to immune responses against microbial and environmental threats and are of particular importance at epithelial barriers. These interfaces are continuously exposed to external factors and thus require immune components to both protect the host from pathogen invasion and to regulate overt inflammation. Recently, substantial efforts have been devoted to understanding how cytokines act on certain cells at barrier sites, and why the dysregulation of immune responses may lead to pathogenesis. In particular, the cytokine IL-22 is involved in preserving an intact epithelium, maintaining a balanced microbiota and a functioning defense system against external threats. However, a tight regulation of IL-22 is generally needed, since uncontrolled IL-22 production can lead to the progression of autoimmunity and cancer. Our aim in this review is to summarize novel findings on IL-22 and its interactions with specific microbial stimuli, and subsequently, to understand their contributions to the function of IL-22 and the clinical outcome. We particularly focus on understanding the detrimental effects of dysregulated control of IL-22 in certain disease contexts.",

Yet, most research on the basic functions of lipo-keratinocytes, which constitute most of the cetacean epidermis, providing the first layer of protection against various environmental aggressors (including an ever-increasing level of pollutants), is restricted to specialized literature on the permeability barrier only. In this review, we have attempted to bring together much of the recent research on the functional biology of cetacean skin, including special adaptations at the cellular, genetic and molecular level. We have correlated these data with the cetacean permeability barrier's unique structural and metabolic adaptations to fully aquatic life, including the development of secondary barriers to ward off challenges such as biofouling as well as exposure to extreme cold for the epidermis, which is outside of the insulation provided by blubber. An apparent contradiction exists between some of the reported gene loss for lipogenic enzymes in cetacean skin and the high degree of cetacean epidermal lipogenesis, as well as loss of desmocollin 1 and desmoplakin genes [while immunolocalization of these proteins is reported (Journal of Anatomy, 234, 201)] warrants a re-evaluation of the gene loss data.",

Epidermal biomarkers can aid in evaluating the functionality of the skin barrier and understanding the mechanisms that underlay its impairment. This narrative review provides an overview of recent studies on epidermal biomarkers associated with the function and integrity of the skin barrier, and their application in research on atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis. The reviewed studies encompass a wide spectrum of molecular, morphological and biophysical biomarkers, mainly obtained from stratum corneum tape strips and biopsies. Lipids, natural moisturizing factors, and structural proteins are the most frequently reported molecular biomarkers. Additionally, corneocyte surface topography and elasticity show potential as biomarkers for assessing the physical barrier of the skin. In contact dermatitis studies, biomarkers are commonly employed to evaluate skin irritation and differentiate between irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. In atopic dermatitis, biomarkers are primarily utilized to identify differences between atopic and healthy skin, for predictive purposes, and monitoring response to therapies. While this overview identifies potential biomarkers for the skin barrier, their validation as epidermal biomarkers for atopic dermatitis and contact dermatitis has yet to be established.",

Dupilumab, a drug that inhibits IL-4 and IL-13, is an effective treatment for AD but there is scarce evidence about its impact on epidermal barrier. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the influence of dupilumab on skin barrier in patients with AD using non-invasive tools. A systematic review was designed following PRISMA guidelines. The literature search identified 73 references and, finally, only 6 were selected, including a total of 233 participants. All the studies were prospective observational studies. Dupilumab improved clinical scores in all the research. Skin barrier function parameters were mainly measured on the volar forearm. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was the parameter most frequently measured, evaluated in all the studies. Dupilumab decreased TEWL on eczematous lesions and non-involved skin. About 33.6% (2/6) studies reported that dupilumab also increased stratum corneum hydration (SCH) on eczematous lesions while one study did not report any changes in this parameter. This drug also decreased temperature and improved ceramide composition. In conclusion, dupilumab improved skin barrier function in AD patients, mainly reflected in a decreased in TEWL values.",

Skin lesions associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) and type 2 skin inflammation display an increment in MCs, which have both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects. The direct and indirect activations of skin MCs by environmental factors such as Staphylococcus aureus can instigate type 2 skin inflammation in AD with poorly understood mechanisms. Furthermore, both IgE-dependent and -independent degranulation of MCs contribute to pruritus in AD. Conversely, MCs suppress type 2 skin inflammation by promoting Treg expansion through IL-2 secretion in the spleen. Moreover, skin MCs can upregulate gene expression involved in skin barrier function, thus mitigating AD-like inflammation. These functional variances of MCs in AD could stem from differences in experimental systems, their localization, and origins. In this review, we will focus on how MCs are maintained in the skin under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions, and how they are involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 skin inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Skin is a complex organ comprised of multiple cell types and microstructures that work in concert to serve critical functions and support the body&rsquo;s homeostasis. It is the outermost, cornified layer of our body that is primarily responsible for the permeability barrier, protecting against external aggressors and preventing water loss from within. The understanding of the organization, functionality, and underlying mechanisms of the skin barrier has evolved greatly through the years. The formation of an intact and well-maintained stratum corneum (SC), where the permeability barrier resides, relies heavily on the differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and the synthesis, release, localization, and binding of lipids that include principally ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. The in-depth research on SC barrier, its disruption in the pathogenesis of diseases, as well as on barrier responses to environmental insults, has enabled the development of modern therapeutics and topical care routines. Among them, ceramide-containing moisturizers have clinically demonstrated the ability to support the management of skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis by reducing the disease severity and recurrence and improving the patients&rsquo; perception of overall skin quality and health. This review focuses on the contributions of various barrier constituents to skin barrier function in health and pathological conditions, and how topical interventions containing essential barrier lipids support barrier restoration and provide relief.

      "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery presents a less invasive pathway, circumventing the need to pass through the gastrointestinal tract and liver, thereby reducing drug breakdown, initial metabolism, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Nevertheless, the unique composition and dense structure of the stratum corneum present a significant barrier to transdermal delivery. This article presents an overview of the current developments in peptides and nanotechnology to address this challenge. Initially, we sum up peptide-containing nanoformulations for transdermal drug delivery, examining them through the lenses of both inorganic and organic materials. Particular emphasis is placed on the diverse roles that peptides play within these nanoformulations, including conferring functionality upon nanocarriers and enhancing the biological efficacy of drugs. Subsequently, we summarize innovative strategies for enhancing skin penetration, categorizing them into passive and active approaches. Lastly, we discuss the therapeutic potential of peptide-containing nanoformulations in addressing a range of diseases, drawing insights from the biological activities and functions of peptides. Furthermore, the challenges hindering clinical translation are also discussed, providing valuable insights for future advancements in transdermal drug delivery.",

      "title": "Keratinocytes: An Enigmatic Factor in Atopic Dermatitis.",
      "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by rashes, itching, and pruritus, is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin with a marked infiltration of inflammatory cells into the lesion. It usually commences in early childhood and coexists with other atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, etc. With a prevalence rate of 1-20% in adults and children worldwide, AD is gradually becoming a major health concern. Immunological aspects have been frequently focused on in the pathogenesis of AD, including the role of the epidermal barrier and the consequent abnormal cytokine expressions. Disrupted epidermal barriers, as well as allergic triggers (food allergy), contact allergens, irritants, microbes, aggravating factors, and ultraviolet light directly initiate the inflammatory response by inducing epidermal keratinocytes, resulting in the abnormal release of various pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines from keratinocytes. In addition, abnormal proteinases, gene mutations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) affecting the function of the epidermal barrier can also contribute towards disease pathophysiology. Apart from this, imbalances in cholinergic or adrenergic responses in the epidermis or the role played by immune cells in the epidermis such as Langerhans cells or antigen-presenting cells can also aggravate pathophysiology. The dearth of specific biomarkers for proper diagnosis and the lack of a permanent cure for AD necessitate investigation in this area. In this context, the widespread role played by keratinocytes in the pathogenesis of AD will be reviewed in this article to facilitate the opening up of new avenues of treatment for AD.",

As a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity, γδ T cells are uniquely poised to rapidly respond to stimulation and can regulate immune responses in peripheral tissues. The dendritic epidermal T cells in the skin epidermis can secrete growth factors to regulate skin homeostasis and re-epithelization and release inflammatory factors to mediate wound healing during skin inflammatory responses. Dermal γδ T cells can regulate the inflammatory process by producing interleukin-17 and other cytokines or chemokines. Here, we offer a review of the immune functions of γδ T cells, intending to understand their role in regulating skin barrier integrity and skin wound healing, which may be crucial for the development of novel therapeutics in skin diseases like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.",

Since the skin interfaces with the environment, it has a variety of roles, including providing a protective barrier against external factors, regulating body temperature, and retaining water in the body. It is also involved in the immune system, interacting with immune cells residing in the dermis. Caveolin-1 (CAV-1) is essential for caveolae formation and has multiple functions including endocytosis, lipid homeostasis, and signal transduction. CAV-1 is known to interact with a variety of signaling molecules and receptors and may influence cell proliferation and migration. Several skin-related disorders, especially those of the inflammatory or hyperproliferative type such as skin cancers, psoriasis, fibrosis, and wound healing, are reported to be associated with aberrant CAV-1 expression. In this review, we have explored CAV-1 involvement in skin physiology and skin diseases.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a complex and multifaceted process involving a variety of interrelated molecular mechanisms and cellular systems. Phenotypically, the biological aging process is accompanied by a gradual loss of cellular function and the systemic deterioration of multiple tissues, resulting in susceptibility to aging-related diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that aging is closely associated with telomere attrition, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels, impaired macro-autophagy, stem cell exhaustion, inflammation, loss of protein balance, deregulated nutrient sensing, altered intercellular communication, and dysbiosis. These age-related changes may be alleviated by intervention strategies, such as calorie restriction, improved sleep quality, enhanced physical activity, and targeted longevity genes. In this review, we summarise the key historical progress in the exploration of important causes of aging and anti-aging strategies in recent decades, which provides a basis for further understanding of the reversibility of aging phenotypes, the application prospect of synthetic biotechnology in anti-aging therapy is also prospected.",

This review provides an overview of the latest advancements in this field, considering both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical approaches. Electronic literature search involved three databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, supplemented by other available literature. Strategies for delaying aging and related diseases comprise pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle choices. It is crucial for these strategies to be substantiated by research-based evidence. Lifestyle options include fasting, fasting-mimicking, and ketogenic diets. Anti-aging drugs and supplements operate through diverse mechanisms. Calorie restriction mimetics include the activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (metformin) and inhibitor of mTOR (rapamycin), alongside rilmenidine, exhibiting both effects. Rosmarinic acid, a natural product, functions through its anti-glycation properties. Age-related protein crosslinks are acknowledged as a causative factor in age-related diseases. Anti-aging medicine is an evolving field with a multitude of drugs and strategies, necessitating further clinical studies and long-term follow-up based on clinical experience and insights gained from delayed adverse events.",

Apart from its prescribed use for severe acne, evidence suggests that isotretinoin is commonly used off-label to treat mild-to-moderate acne, inflammatory skin conditions, genodermatoses, skin cancer, and other skin disorders. This is due to its anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antineoplastic properties. Some \"off-label\" use is successful, while others are ineffective.

      "abstract": "Aging is a multifactorial biological process involving chronic diseases that manifest from the molecular level to the systemic level. From its inception to 31 May 2022, this study searched the PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases to identify relevant research from 15,983 articles. Multiple approaches have been employed to combat aging, such as dietary restriction (DR), exercise, exchanging circulating factors, gene therapy, and anti-aging drugs. Among them, anti-aging drugs are advantageous in their ease of adherence and wide prevalence. Despite a shared functional output of aging alleviation, the current anti-aging drugs target different signal pathways that frequently cross-talk with each other. At present, six important signal pathways were identified as being critical in the aging process, including pathways for the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nutrient signal pathway, silent information regulator factor 2-related enzyme 1 (SIRT1), regulation of telomere length and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and energy metabolism. These signal pathways could be targeted by many anti-aging drugs, with the corresponding representatives of rapamycin, metformin, acarbose, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD",

      "abstract": "Scientific research has demonstrated that Tinospora cordifolia acts as an anti-aging agent in several experimental models, generating global interest in its underlying molecular mechanisms of this activity. The aim of the study was to identify the possible phytochemical compounds of T. cordifolia that might combat age-related illness through integrating network pharmacology, molecular docking techniques, and molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore their potential mechanisms of action. To carry out this study, several databases were used, including PubChem, KNApSAcK family database, PubMed, SwissADME, Molsoft, SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, and OMIM database. For network development and GO enrichment analysis KEGG, ShinyGo 0.77, and the STRING database were used. For better analysis, the networks were also constructed using Cytoscape 3.9.1. The Cytoscape network analyzer tool was used for data analysis, and molecular docking was done via Vina-GPU-2.0. The best compounds and AKT1 were finally subjected to MD simulation for 100 ns. The CytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape identified ten key targets, commonly called hub genes, including AKT1, GAPDH, and TP53, and so on. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed the relevant biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions involved in treating aging-related disorders. KEGG pathway analysis involved neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, lipid and atherosclerosis, and cAMP signaling. The docking of 100 T. cordifolia compounds with AKT1 demonstrated good binding affinity, particularly for Amritoside, Sitagliptin, Berberine, and Piperine. Finally, the relative stability of four-hit phytochemicals was validated by MD simulation, which may be the most crucial compound for anti-aging activity. In conclusion, this study used network pharmacology, molecular docking, and MD simulation to identify the compounds in T. cordifolia and proposed a potential mechanism for anti-aging activity. These results suggest future directions for the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases.",

Skin anti-aging refers to a reduction in the skin aging phenomenon through medical cosmetic technologies. In recent years, new biomaterials have been continuously developed for improving the appearance of the skin through mechanical tissue filling, regulating collagen synthesis and degradation, inhibiting pigmentation, and repairing the skin barrier. This review summarizes the mechanisms associated with skin aging, describes the biomaterials that are commonly used in medical aesthetics and their possible modes of action, and discusses the application strategies of biomaterials in this area. Moreover, the synergistic effects of such biomaterials and other active ingredients, such as stem cells, exosomes, growth factors, and antioxidants, on tissue regeneration and anti-aging are evaluated. Finally, the possible challenges and development prospects of biomaterials in the field of anti-aging are discussed, and novel ideas for future innovations in this area are summarized.",

      "abstract": "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a potential method of gene silencing to target specific genes. Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved multiple siRNA-based therapeutics, many biological barriers limit their use for treating diseases. Such limitations include challenges concerning systemic or local administration, short half-life, rapid clearance rates, nonspecific binding, cell membrane penetration inability, ineffective endosomal escape, pH sensitivity, endonuclease degradation, immunological responses, and intracellular trafficking. To overcome these barriers, various strategies have been developed to stabilize siRNA, ensuring their delivery to the target site. Chemical modifications implemented with nucleotides or the phosphate backbone can reduce off-target binding and immune stimulation. Encapsulation or formulation can protect siRNA from endonuclease degradation and enhance cellular uptake while promoting endosomal escape. Additionally, various techniques such as viral vectors, aptamers, cell-penetrating peptides, liposomes, and polymers have been developed for delivering siRNA, greatly improving their bioavailability and therapeutic potential.",

      "abstract": "Although aesthetic benefits are a desirable effect of the treatment of skin aging, it is also important in controlling several skin diseases, mainly in aged people. The development of new dermocosmetics has rapidly increased due to consumers' demand for non-invasive products with lower adverse effects than those currently available on the market. Natural compounds of plant origin and herbal-derived formulations have been popularized due to their various safe active products, which act through different mechanisms of action on several signaling pathways for skin aging. Based on this, the aim of the review was to identify the recent advances in herbal-derived product research, including herbal formulations and isolated compounds with skin anti-aging properties. The studies evaluated the biological effects of herbal-derived products in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies, highlighting the effects that were reported in clinical trials with available pharmacodynamics data that support their protective effects to treat, prevent, or control human skin aging. Thus, it was possible to identify that gallic and ferulic acids and herbal formulations containing ",

      "abstract": "Aging is closely associated with collagen degradation, impacting the structure and strength of the muscles, joints, bones, and skin. The continuous aging of the skin is a natural process that is influenced by extrinsic factors such as UV exposure, dietary patterns, smoking habits, and cosmetic supplements. Supplements that contain collagen can act as remedies that help restore vitality and youth to the skin, helping combat aging. Notably, collagen supplements enriched with essential amino acids such as proline and glycine, along with marine fish collagen, have become popular for their safety and effectiveness in mitigating the aging process. To compile the relevant literature on the anti-aging applications of marine collagen, a search and analysis of peer-reviewed papers was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase, covering publications from 1991 to 2024. From in vitro to in vivo experiments, the reviewed studies elucidate the anti-aging benefits of marine collagen, emphasizing its role in combating skin aging by minimizing oxidative stress, photodamage, and the appearance of wrinkles. Various bioactive marine peptides exhibit diverse anti-aging properties, including free radical scavenging, apoptosis inhibition, lifespan extension in various organisms, and protective effects in aging humans. Furthermore, the topical application of hyaluronic acid is discussed as a mechanism to increase collagen production and skin moisture, contributing to the anti-aging effects of collagen supplementation. The integration of bio-tissue engineering in marine collagen applications is also explored, highlighting its proven utility in skin healing and bone regeneration applications. However, limitations to the scope of its application exist. Thus, by delving into these nuanced considerations, this review contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the potential and challenges associated with marine collagen in the realm of anti-aging applications.",

      "abstract": "Polymer photo-oxidation aging is a significant issue in plastics engineering, leading to reduced performance, shorter lifespan, and additional pollution. Anti-aging agents, including antioxidants and ultraviolet (UV)-shielding agents, are used to ameliorate the above problems. However, multi-component agents involve complex synthesis, mixed processing, and environmental concerns. Therefore, developing robust, multi-functional, one-component anti-aging agents is crucial. This study proposed a new class of one-component poly(coumarin) anti-aging agents, synthesized through enzymatic polymerization of coumarin. These agents exhibited a broader UV absorption spectrum and higher antioxidative capacity than commercial UV-shielding agent UV326 and antioxidant AO1010. Calculating the O-H bond dissociation energy and reaction energy barrier with peroxy free radicals (ROO˙) showed that the material could effectively attenuate UV radiation and scavenge free radicals, improving anti-aging properties. Further studies indicated the potential of poly(coumarin) anti-aging agents for enhanced polymer photostability and improved food preservation packaging. Consequently, poly(coumarin) nanoparticles can act as versatile anti-aging compounds, potentially replacing conventional multi-component agents and providing a new foundation for one-component materials with multiple functions.",

      "abstract": "Endogenous melatonin levels are inversely associated with age and cognitive deficits. Although melatonin can improve psychopathological behavior disturbances in clinical trials, whether melatonin may also enhance cognitive function remains elusive. This study examined cognitive outcomes from randomized trials of melatonin treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), insomnia, and healthy-subjects. Twenty-two studies met the inclusion criteria (AD = 9, insomnia = 2, healthy-subjects = 11). AD patients receiving >12 weeks of melatonin treatment improved mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score [MD: 1.82 (1.01; 2.63) p < 0.0001]. Importantly, melatonin significantly improved MMSE score in mild stage of AD [MD: 1.89 (0.96; 2.82) p < 0.0001]. In healthy-subjects, although daytime melatonin treatment notably decreased in accuracy by correct responses [SMD: -0.74 (-1.03; -0.45) p < 0.00001], the reaction-time score on different stimuli (p = 0.37) did not increased. Additionally, by pooling of short-term, spatial, and visual memory scores, melatonin did not reduce memory function (p = 0.08). Meta-analysis of MMSE score suggested that melatonin is effective in treatment for mild stage of AD. Additionally, we propose that melatonin may be preferable to traditional hypnotics in management of insomnia.",

Aging is a physiological process involving multiple organs and numerous reactions, and therefore it is not easily explained or defined. At present, a growing number of studies are focused on the mechanisms of aging and potential strategies to delay aging. Some clinical drugs have been demonstrated to have anti-aging effects; however, many still have deficits with respect to safety and long-term use. Polysaccharides are natural and efficient biological macromolecules that act as antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, and immune regulators. Not surprisingly, these molecules have recently gained attention for their potential use in anti-aging therapies. In fact, multiple polysaccharides have been found to have excellent anti-aging effects in different animal models including ",

Anti-aging medicine applies advanced science and medical technology to early detection, prevention, treatment, and reversal of age-related dysfunctions, disorders, and diseases. Therefore, anti-aging diagnostic medicine and healthcare are important factors in helping the elderly population lead healthy and active lives. However, it is challenging to diagnose various aging and related diseases accurately through various forms of anti-aging diagnostic medicine and health management. It may not be treated appropriately, so many older people are making various efforts to prevent aging themselves in advance. Therefore, anti-aging medicine and health care have been developed in various forms, from health checkups to alternative medicine and biophysical technology beyond simple clinical medicine, and are being applied to demand the needs of the elderly. This review intends to explore and characterize various applications related to anti-aging medicine and healthcare in the elderly. In addition, economic, medical, and ethical considerations arising from the relationship between the increase in the elderly population and the continuous development of anti-aging medicine can be considered.",

Given the increasing global life expectancy, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to prevent and manage Alzheimer's disease, with a particular focus on anti-aging interventions. Recent scientific advancements have unveiled several promising strategies for combating Alzheimer's disease (AD), ranging from lifestyle interventions to cutting-edge pharmacological treatments and therapies targeting the underlying biological processes of aging and AD. Regular physical exercise, cognitive engagement, a balanced diet, and social interaction serve as key pillars in maintaining brain health. At the same time, therapies target key pathological mechanisms of AD, such as amyloid-beta accumulation, tau abnormalities, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and synaptic loss, offering potential breakthroughs in treatment. Moreover, cutting-edge innovations such as gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, and novel drug delivery systems are emerging as potential game-changers in the fight against AD. This review critically evaluates the latest research on anti-aging interventions and their potential in preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) by exploring the connections between aging mechanisms and AD pathogenesis. It provides a comprehensive analysis of both well-established and emerging strategies, while also identifying key gaps in current knowledge to guide future research efforts.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The exact mechanisms underlying the aging process are not fully elucidated. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that several pathways, such as sirtuin, AMP-activated protein kinase, insulin-like growth factor, autophagy, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 play critical roles in regulating aging. Furthermore, genetic or dietary interventions of these pathways can extend lifespan by delaying the aging process. Seaweeds are a food source rich in many nutrients, including fibers, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive compounds. The health benefits of seaweeds include, but are not limited to, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-obese activities. Interestingly, a body of studies shows that some seaweed-derived extracts or isolated compounds, can modulate these aging-regulating pathways or even extend lifespans of various animal models. However, few such studies have been conducted on higher animals or even humans. In this review, we focused on potential anti-aging bioactive substances in seaweeds that have been studied in cells and animals mainly based on their anti-aging cellular and molecular mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Skin aging is influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The gradual manifestation of changes in telomere length and telomerase activity, as crucial indicators of aging, elucidates the underlying mechanism of skin aging. This review aims to comprehensively analyze the association between telomeres and aging, along with their impact on skin biological function. Firstly, we summarize the structure and function of telomeres and their role in cell division. Subsequently, we discuss the mechanisms through which telomere regulation contributes to aging processes while analyzing its involvement in skin aging by elaborating on biological markers. Furthermore, this paper presents a summary of recent research progress that reveals the correlation between telomere length and skin aging as well as model building methods; it also proposes telomere length as a potential indicator for predicting skin aging. Finally, anti-aging strategies based on telomere protection are discussed including drug therapy and lifestyle adjustments. This paper provides a systematic overview of the role played by telomeres in the field of skin aging for the first time, offering new perspectives and ideas for future prevention and treatment.",

      "title": "Gut Microbiota and Its Role in Anti-aging Phenomenon: Evidence-Based Review.",
      "abstract": "The gut microbiota widely varies from individual to individual, but the variation shows stability over a period of time. The presence of abundant bacterial taxa is a common structure that determines the microbiota of human being. The presence of this microbiota greatly varies from geographic location, sex, food habits and age. Microbiota existing within the gut plays a significant role in nutrient absorption, development of immunity, curing of diseases and various developmental phases. With change in age, chronology diversification and variation of gut microbiota are observed within human being. But it has been observed that with the enhancement of age the richness of the microbial diversity has shown a sharp decline. The enhancement of age also results in the drift of the characteristic of the microbes associated with the microbiota from commensals to pathogenic. Various studies have shown that age associated gut-dysbiosis may result in decrease in tlongevity along with unhealthy aging. The host signalling pathways regulate the presence of the gut microbiota and their longevity. The presence of various nutrients regulates the presence of various microbial species. Innate immunity can be triggered due to the mechanism of gut dysbiosis resulting in the development of various age-related pathological syndromes and early aging. The gut microbiota possesses the ability to communicate with the host system with the help of various types of biomolecules, epigenetic mechanisms and various types of signalling-independent pathways. Drift in this mechanism of communication may affect the life span along with the health of the host. Thus, this review would focus on the use of gut-microbiota in anti-aging and healthy conditions of the host system.",

      "abstract": "Aging is an unavoidable process, leading to cell senescence due to physiochemical changes in an organism. Anti-aging remedies have always been of great interest since ancient times. The purpose of anti-aging activities is to increase the life span and the quality of life. Anti-aging activities are primarily involved in the therapies of age-related disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. These diseases are triggered by multiple factors that are involved in numerous molecular pathways including telomere shortening, NF-κB pathway, adiponectin receptor pathway, insulin, and IGF signaling pathway, AMPK, mTOR, and mitochondria dysfunction. Natural products are known as effective molecules to delay the aging process through influencing metabolic pathways and thus ensure an extended lifespan. These natural compounds are being utilized in drug design and development through computational and high throughput techniques for effective pro-longevity drugs. A comprehensive study on natural compounds demonstrating their anti-aging activities along with databases of natural products for drug designing was executed and summarized in this review article.",

      "abstract": "Anthriscus sylvestris (L.) Hoffm has a long history of use for anti-aging, although the anti-aging properties of its decoction ingredients have been seldom explored. This study marks the first detailed examination of the in vivo anti-aging activity of A. sylvestris roots polysaccharide (AP). Structural analyses revealed that AP is a neutral heteropolysaccharide with an average molecular weight (Mw) of 34.17 kDa, comprising glucose, xylose, galactose, mannose, and arabinose, with a backbone primarily of 1,4-α-D-Glc and minor branching at 1,4,6-α-D-Man. Its advanced structure is characterized by stable triple-helical chains and nanoscale agglomerated spherical particles. Using a D-gal-induced aging mouse model, further investigation showed that AP boosts the activity of various antioxidant enzymes via the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathway. Aging-related immune decline was also mitigated by an increase in lymphocyte production in thymus. Moreover, AP reduced inflammation and downregulated aging genes p53 and p21 in hippocampus and liver tissues, enhanced the cholinergic system, and improved liver functions and lipid metabolism. The collective impact of these mechanisms underscores the robust anti-aging properties of AP. These findings highlight the anti-aging and immunomodulatory potential of A. sylvestris polysaccharide, broadening the understanding of its active components.",

      "abstract": "Ferulic acid (FA) provides broad biological functions that have been used in cosmetics formulation as a photoprotection, anti-aging, and brightening agent. However, its application is limited by its tendency to deteriorate by exposure to heat, humidity, and light. This study aimed to enhance the stability of FA by encapsulation in phosphorylated rice starch (PRS) and evaluate its effect on improving human skin. First, FA was encapsulated in PRS and characterized by FTIR, SEM, XRD, and DSC. Then, its stability when exposed to a temperature of 45 °C and light and its anti-aging effect on 16 volunteers were investigated. The results indicated that FA was successfully encapsulated in PRS with an encapsulation yield of 77%, EE (73%) and LE (65%). After 1 month at the high temperature/80%RH, the encapsulated FA retained its quantity (70%), whereas free FA was retained at only 50%. Under light exposure conditions, the encapsulated FA was retained at 65%, which was higher than FA (35%). Franz diffusion cell was used and demonstrated that PRS provided the controlled release of FA. Application of encapsulated FA and FA creams showed an absence of skin irritation in all volunteers. After 1 month, the encapsulated FA cream was found to be better than the FA cream on skin lightening, elasticity, smoothness, roughness, scaliness, and wrinkle. The results indicated that PRS is a potential wall material for enhancing the stability of FA, resulting in more efficacious skin lightening and anti-aging properties.",

Taking into account the actual preoccupations of both consumers and researchers, healthy anti-aging alternatives are being intensively studied in order to address such concerns. Due to their functional features, plant flavonoids can be considered valuable nutraceuticals. This paper highlights the possibilities to use flavonoids extracted from various plants for their anti-aging potential on the skin, brain, and heart. Moreover, their anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic properties are summarized, along with the senescence-associated mechanisms. Both the nutraceutical and cosmeceutical fields are continuously developing and flavonoids originating from plants are promising candidates to obtain such products. Thus, the bioactive compounds' extraction and their subsequent involvement in innovative product manufacturing must be carefully performed while being aware of the various intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may affect the phytochemicals' structures, bioavailability, and health effects.",

      "abstract": "Nanotechnology is an innovative area of science that deals with things smaller than 100 nanometers. The influence of nanotechnology in the cosmetic industry is overwhelming since it can enhance the properties attained by the particles at the nano level, including color, solubility, etc, and can also promote the bioavailability of API. A plethora of nanomaterials can be employed in cosmetics, including organic and inorganic nanoparticles. Unlike orthodox carriers, they facilitate easy penetration of the product into the skin, thereby increasing the stability and allowing a controlled drug release so that they can permeate deeper into the skin and start revitalizing it. Nanomaterials rejuvenate the skin by forming an occlusive barrier to inhibit the loss of water from the skin's surface and thereby moisturize the skin. Nano-cosmeceuticals are used to provide better protection against UV radiation, facilitate deeper skin penetration, and give long-lasting effects. Although they still have some safety concerns, hence detailed characterization or risk assessments are required to fulfill the standard safety requirements. In this review, an attempt is made to make a brief overview of various nanocosmeceuticals skincare and anti-aging products.",

      "abstract": "Encapsulation of bioactive compounds in the liposome system provides several advantages, such as enhancing the stability and lowering the toxicity of active compounds. Coffee berry extract (CBE) has previously been established to have in vitro anti-aging properties and to retard the aging of human skin. The purposes of this study were to encapsulate CBE in nanoliposomes and to assess its stability and in vitro anti-aging potential in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), as well as in healthy human skin. In the HDF model, anti-aging potential was determined by nitric oxide (NO) and collagenase inhibition assays and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity assay, whereas in healthy human skin (in vivo), the skin elasticity and brightness were examined. First, liposomal CBE (L-CBE) was created with a particle size of 117.33 ± 2.91 nm, a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.36 ± 0.03, and a zeta potential of -56.13 ± 1.87 mV. The percentages of encapsulation efficacy (%EE) and loading efficacy (%LE) were 71.26 ± 3.12% and 2.18 ± 0.18%, respectively. After undergoing a 12-week stability test, the L-CBE retained more phenolic content than the free CBE when stored at 4 °C, room temperature, and 45 °C. Compared to free CBE, the L-CBE demonstrated a more consistent, elevated, and prolonged release of phenolics from the lipid system. In human dermal fibroblasts, L-CBE showed lower toxicity, and at its maximum nontoxic concentration (10 mg/mL), it exhibited slightly higher anti-aging effects than CBE, including NO inhibition, enhanced SOD activity, and anti-collagenase activities. In clinical trials (30 volunteer subjects), none of the participants' skin was irritated when the L-CBE, the CBE, or base creams were applied. After 2 weeks of application, the L-CBE and CBE creams both demonstrated an improvement in skin elasticity and a reduction in melanin levels, and after 4 weeks, L-CBE cream showed a significantly greater improvement in skin elasticity and lightening. The results demonstrate that the encapsulation of the CBE in liposomal systems could increase its stability and skin penetration, reduce its toxicity, and maintain its anti-aging effect, which is powerful enough to be exploited in anti-aging and whitening agents for application in cosmetics and cosmeceuticals.",

      "abstract": "The interest in aging and anti-aging research has increased significantly in recent years, leading to rapid expansion in the anti-aging market. Aging is associated with gradual physiological changes and an elevated risk of age-related ailments, and is divided into three categories: usual aging, successful aging, and pathological aging. Each category is associated with distinct implications for health and well-being. Middle-aged women who experience accelerated physiological changes that are intensified by hormonal changes during menopause are particularly vulnerable to chronic diseases. The importance of anti-aging tests is increasing since they enable early identification and intervention. Telomere length, oxidative stress markers, DNA repair markers, RNA profiles, inflammatory markers, hormone levels, and epigenetic changes are some molecular parameters studied to test for aging. In addition, a thorough review of middle-aged women's anti-aging profiles also includes monitoring the vitamin D levels and assessing the effects of endocrine-disrupting substances on ovarian aging. The application of personalized medicine paradigms, utilizing various diagnostic methods, will enable accurate risk prediction and the implementation of focused therapies, ultimately promoting the extension of health span and the improvement of quality of life in middle-aged women.",

      "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable and complex biological process involving multi-factorial mechanisms. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor in the aging process, characterized by a decline in mitochondrial quality and activity, leading to aging and aging-related diseases. Therefore, mitochondria have become an attractive target in anti-aging therapies. Several senolytic drugs targeting mitochondria and antioxidant agents have been used in anti-aging research in the past few years. However, these strategies may cause adverse effects with long-term medication. In this extensive review, we propose \"mitochondrial transplantation,\" which transfers healthy mitochondria from donor cells to recipient cells to replace damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, as a new alternative strategy for treating mitochondrial dysfunction and aging-associated diseases. In this review, we introduce the contemporary landscape of mitochondrial transplantation, then discuss intensely the successful applications of mitochondrial transplantation therapy in aging diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular aging, and reproductive aging, highlighting its translational potential. Finally, we summarize and prospect the challenges and opportunities mitochondrial transplantation faces in anti-aging therapy.",

      "abstract": "Quercetin (QUE) is one of the most widely distributed and used flavonoid. It has many biological activities and pharmacological effect. As a polyhydroxy phenol, QUE is easily oxidized. However, it is unclear how its biology efficacy changes after oxidation. In this study, we prepared QUE oxidation product (QUE-ox) through enzymatic oxidation of QUE. We found the oxidation reduced the antioxidant activity of QUE but increased its anti-amyloid activity in vitro. In C. elegans, oxidation increased the anti-aging effects of QUE. Further experiments showed that both QUE and QUE-ox delayed aging by improving stress resistance, but they have different molecular mechanisms. QUE mainly increased the transcriptional activities of DAF-16 and SKN-1, resulting in the enhancement of expression of oxidative stress resistance genes, and further increased the oxidative resistance in C. elegans. QUE-ox increased the transcriptional activities of DAF-16 and HSF-1 transcription factors to enhance the heat stress resistance. In summary, our study indicated oxidized QUE has stronger anti-amyloid activity and anti-aging effect than native form. This study provides a theoretical basis for the safe and rational application of QUE, especially for its antioxidant, anti-amyloid and anti-aging effects.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing proportion of the global aging population, aging mechanisms and anti-aging strategies become hot topics. Nonetheless, the safety of non-natural anti-aging active molecule and the changes in physiological function that occur during aging have not been clarified. There is therefore a need to develop safer pharmaceutical interventions for anti-aging. Numerous types of research have shown that food-derived biomolecules are of great interest due to their unique contribution to anti-aging safety issues and the prevention of degenerative diseases. Among these, polyphenolic organic compounds are widely used in anti-aging research for their ability to mitigate the physiological functional changes that occur during aging. The mechanisms include the free radical theory, immune aging theory, cellular autophagy theory, epigenetic modification theory, gut microbial effects on aging theory, telomere shortening theory, etc. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying the anti-aging effects of polyphenols found in food-derived bioactive molecules, while also addressing the challenges associated with anti-aging pharmaceuticals. The review concludes by offering insights into the current landscape of anti-aging active molecule research, aiming to serve as a valuable resource for further scholarly inquiry.",

Yet, the anti-aging effects of its polysaccharides have not been thoroughly investigated. This study marks the first exploration of the anti-aging activity of Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge. polysaccharides (AABP). The MW of AABP-1a was determined to be 210.062 kDa, with a composition consisting predominantly of glucose and mannose in a molar ratio of approximately 4:1. The backbone of AABP-1a was mainly composed of →4)-2Ac-β-Man(1→ and →4)-β-Glc(1→ and a small amount of branched →4,6)-β-Glc(1→ and →3,4)-β-Glc(1→, the branching part was composed of →6)-β-Glc(1→ and t-α-Glc(1→. AABP-1a has antioxidant capacity and can improve cell cycle arrest mediated by senescence markers such as p53, p21, p16 and SASP, and reduce the accumulation of damaged DNA. In addition, it could reduce the activity of SA-β-Gal in zebrafish, prolong the lifespan of C. elegans and reduce the expression of lipofuscin.

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are the known group of phytochemicals that essentially consists of phenolic rings. These are the plant product present in varied fruits and vegetables. These secondary metabolites perform a protective function in plants from environmental and biological stress. When consumed as a human diet these are also known to prevent various age-associated diseases. Polyphenols are known to possess antioxidant properties and protect against oxidative stress. The literature survey was carried out using databases such as PubMed, Science direct and Springer. The research articles from last 10-12 years were selected for this review based on its relevancy with the topic. The articles selected was mainly focused on quercetin and its health benefits. The present review highlights the main functions of a flavonoid, quercetin. Quercetin is among the widely occurring polyphenol, found abundantly in nature. It is commonly present in different plant products. Onion is known to have the highest quantity of quercetin. This plant compound is possessed antioxidant properties and is considered to have a protective function against aging. It is known to be present in both free and conjugated forms. Quercetin has anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-diabetic, and anti-viral properties. The molecule is lipophilic and can easily cross the BBB (Blood-Brain Barrier) and hence protects from neurodegenerative diseases. Various in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated the role of quercetin and here a detailed review of quercetin as a curative agent in neurodegeneration, diabetes, cancer, and inflammation has been carried out. Studies have proved that quercetin plays a crucial role in the prevention of age-related disorders. Quercetin is a potent antioxidant which is currently being used in various pharmaceuticals. Properties of quercetin can be further explored in various other disorders. Nanoformulations and liposomal formulations of quercetin can be made to treat other age associated diseases.",

      "abstract": "This research studies in detail four different assays, namely DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), FRAP (ferric ion reducing antioxidant potential) and FC (Folin-Ciocalteu), to determine the antioxidant capacity of standard substances as well as 50 organosolv lignins, and two kraft lignins. The coefficient of variation was determined for each method and was lowest for ABTS and highest for DPPH. The best correlation was found for FRAP and FC, which both rely on a single electron transfer mechanism. A good correlation between ABTS, FRAP and FC, respectively, could be observed, even though ABTS relies on a more complex reaction mechanism. The DPPH assay merely correlates with the others, implying that it reflects different antioxidative attributes due to a different reaction mechanism. Lignins obtained from paulownia and silphium have been investigated for the first time regarding their antioxidant capacity. Paulownia lignin is in the same range as beech wood lignin, while silphium lignin resembles wheat straw lignin. Miscanthus lignin is an exception from the grass lignins and possesses a significantly higher antioxidant capacity. All lignins possess a good antioxidant capacity and thus are promising candidates for various applications, e. g. as additives in food packaging or for biomedical purposes.",

As a significant nutritional factor, the trace element selenium (Se) may remodel gradual and spontaneous physiological changes caused by oxidative stress, potentially leading to disease prevention and healthy aging. Se is involved in improving antioxidant defense, immune functions, and metabolic homeostasis. An inadequate Se status may reduce human life expectancy by accelerating the aging process or increasing vulnerability to various disorders, including immunity dysfunction, and cancer risk.

      "abstract": "Initially adopted as a mucolytic about 60 years ago, the cysteine prodrug N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the standard of care to treat paracetamol intoxication, and is included on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines. Additionally, NAC increasingly became the epitome of an \"antioxidant\". Arguably, it is the most widely used \"antioxidant\" in experimental cell and animal biology, as well as clinical studies. Most investigators use and test NAC with the idea that it prevents or attenuates oxidative stress. Conventionally, it is assumed that NAC acts as (i) a reductant of disulfide bonds, (ii) a scavenger of reactive oxygen species and/or (iii) a precursor for glutathione biosynthesis. While these mechanisms may apply under specific circumstances, they cannot be generalized to explain the effects of NAC in a majority of settings and situations. In most cases the mechanism of action has remained unclear and untested. In this review, we discuss the validity of conventional assumptions and the scope of a newly discovered mechanism of action, namely the conversion of NAC into hydrogen sulfide and sulfane sulfur species. The antioxidative and cytoprotective activities of per- and polysulfides may explain many of the effects that have previously been ascribed to NAC or NAC-derived glutathione.",

      "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a life-threatening and irreversible disease. The fibrosis process is largely driven by hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which undergo transdifferentiation from an inactivated state to an activated one during persistent liver damage. This activated state is responsible for collagen deposition in liver tissue and is accompanied by increased CD44 expression on the surfaces of HSCs and amplified intracellular oxidative stress, which contributes to the fibrosis process. To address this problem, we have developed a strategy that combines CD44-targeting of activated HSCs with an antioxidative approach. We developed hyaluronic acid-bilirubin nanoparticles (HABNs), composed of endogenous bilirubin, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory bile acid, and hyaluronic acid, an endogenous CD44-targeting glycosaminoglycan biopolymer. Our findings demonstrate that intravenously administered HABNs effectively targeted the liver, particularly activated HSCs, in fibrotic mice with choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined high-fat diet (CD-HFD)-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). HABNs were able to inhibit HSC activation and proliferation and collagen production. Furthermore, in a murine CD-HFD-induced NASH fibrosis model, intravenously administered HABNs showed potent fibrotic modulation activity. Our study suggests that HABNs have the potential to serve as a targeted anti-hepatic-fibrosis therapy by modulating activated HSCs via CD44-targeting and antioxidant strategies. This strategy could also be applied to various ROS-related diseases in which CD44-overexpressing cells play a pivotal role.",

      "abstract": "Vitiligo is an autoimmune skin disorder caused by dysfunctional pigment-producing melanocytes which are attacked by immune cells. Oxidative stress is considered to play a crucial role in activating consequent autoimmune responses related to vitiligo. Melanin synthesis by melanocytes is the main intracellular stressor, producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under normal physiological conditions, the antioxidative nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway functions as a crucial mediator for cells to resist oxidative stress. In pathological situations, such as with antioxidant defects or under inflammation, ROS accumulate and cause cell damage. Herein, we summarize events at the cellular level under excessive ROS in vitiligo and highlight exposure to melanocyte-specific antigens that trigger immune responses. Such responses lead to functional impairment and the death of melanocytes, which sequentially increase melanocyte cytotoxicity through both innate and adaptive immunity. This report provides new perspectives and advances our understanding of interrelationships between oxidative stress and autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. We describe progress with targeted antioxidant therapy, with the aim of providing potential therapeutic approaches.",

      "abstract": "Recently, numerous evidence has revealed that excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial disruption during acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) will aggravate the inflammatory process. To identify whether antioxidation can be one of the treatment strategies during this progress, we chose mitoQ, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that was proved to be effective in reducing ROS generated in mitochondria, as a ROS scavenger to investigate the role of antioxidation in ALI. We demonstrated that overoxidation occurred during the process of ALI, which could be reduced by mitoQ. In the meantime, apoptosis of endothelial cells of ALI mice, accompanied by hyperpermeability of pulmonary vascular and impaired pulmonary function, was partially reversed following an intraperitoneal injection of mitoQ. Moreover, in in vitro study, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced excessive ROS production, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs), which were rectified by mitoQ. To explore underlying mechanisms, we proceeded RNA-sequencing and found significantly upregulated expression of musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma F (MafF) in mitoQ treated group. Additionally, mitoQ inhibited the degradation and increased nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and upregulated its downstream antioxidant response elements (AREs), such as heme oxygenase (HO)-1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO)-1. This effect was abolished by transfecting HPMECs with Nrf2 or Maff siRNA. In Nrf2 deficient mice, the protective effects of mitoQ on LPS model of ALI were largely vanished. Taken together, these results provide insights into how antioxidation exerts beneficial effects on ALI via maintaining mitochondrial hemostasis, inhibiting endothelial cells apoptosis, attenuating the endothelial disruption and regulating lung inflammation via Nrf2-MafF/ARE pathway.",

Increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is closely associated with decreased antioxidant capacity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Currently, despite the availability of modern pharmaceuticals, dietary-derived antioxidants are becoming more popular in developed societies to delay the progression of CVDs. One of the antioxidants derived from herbs, fruits, whole grains, juices, beers, and wines is vanillic acid (VA), which, as a phenolic compound, possesses different therapeutic properties, including cardioprotective. Based on experimental evidence, VA improves mitochondrial function as a result of the reduction in ROS production, aggravates antioxidative status, scavenges free radicals, and reduces levels of lipid peroxidation, thereby decreasing cardiac dysfunction, in particular CTX and MIRI. Considering the role of OS in the pathophysiology of CVDs, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively address recent evidence on the antioxidant importance of VA in the cardiovascular system.",

      "abstract": "Myocardial ischemic/reperfusion (IR) injury is a global cardiovascular disease with high mortality and morbidity. Therapeutic interventions for myocardial ischemia involve restoring the occluded coronary artery. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) inevitably impair the cardiomyocytes during the ischemic and reperfusion phases. Antioxidant therapy holds great promise against myocardial IR injury. The current therapeutic methodologies for ROS scavenging depend predominantly on administering antioxidants. Nevertheless, the intrinsic drawbacks of antioxidants limit their further clinical transformation. The use of nanoplatforms with versatile characteristics greatly benefits drug delivery in myocardial ischemic therapy. Nanoplatform-mediated drug delivery significantly improves drug bioavailability, increases therapeutic index, and reduces systemic toxicity. Nanoplatforms can be specifically and reasonably designed to enhance molecule accumulation at the myocardial site. The present review initially summarizes the mechanism of ROS generation during the process of myocardial ischemia. The understanding of this phenomenon will facilitate the advancement of innovative therapeutic strategies against myocardial IR injury. The latest developments in nanomedicine for treating myocardial ischemic injury are then discussed. Finally, the current challenges and perspectives in antioxidant therapy for myocardial IR injury are addressed.",

      "abstract": "In the history of modern nutritional science, understanding antioxidants is one of the major topics. In many cases, food-derived antioxidants have π conjugate or thiol group in their molecular structures because π conjugate stabilizes radical by its delocalization and two thiol groups form a disulfide bond in its antioxidative process. In recent years, antioxidant peptides have received much attention because for their ability to scavenge free radicals, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, chelation of transition metal ions, as well as their additional nutritional value. Among them, dipeptides are attracting much interest as post-amino acids, which have residues in common with amino acids, but also have different physiological properties and functions from those of amino acids. Especially, dipeptides containing moieties of several amino acid (tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, cysteine, and methionine) possess potent antioxidant activity. This review summarizes previous details of structural property, radical scavenging activity, and biological activity of antioxidant dipeptide. Hopefully, this review will help provide a new insight into the study of the biological functions of antioxidant dipeptides.",

      "abstract": "Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury plays a pivotal role in the development of graft dysfunction and allograft rejection after transplantation. Excessive free radical production and massive consumption of endogenous antioxidants are common mechanisms underlying I/R injury and are implicated in posttransplant organ damage and reduced graft viability. Ascorbic Acid (AA) is an essential micronutrient involved in several biological processes, from antioxidative response to the modulation of apoptosis and inflammation. These properties, combined to the safety profile, low cost, and ease of administration and measurement, make AA a potential bullet for reducing I/R damage in the setting of solid organ transplantation. Although multiple preclinical and clinical studies have been performed to investigate the effectiveness of AA administration in reducing I/R injury during transplantation, its therapeutic potential remains controversial as well as the optimal dosage, timing, and combination with other antioxidants. In this review, we summarize the AA modulated metabolic pathways, focusing on its potential role in the treatment of solid organ (kidney, liver, lung, heart, and pancreas) transplantation.",

Chinese herbal polysaccharides have a wide range of sources. It is found that polysaccharides in many plants and microorganisms have significant antioxidant effects, mainly through the endogenous antioxidant stress Nrf2/ARE pathway to regulate the expression of downstream antioxidant enzymes. These antioxidant enzymes can further block the free radical chain reaction, thus reducing the generation of free radicals. Secondly, by inhibiting the expression of iNOS mRNA and reducing NO production, it can significantly increase the antioxidant capacity and reduce oxidative stress injury. Polysaccharides are rich in natural resources, their multi-channel, multi-target, multi-effect, and other characteristics have made great progress in antioxidants.",

Scavenging the accumulation of free radicals in the body and inhibiting the production of free radicals are effective ways to reduce the occurrence of oxidative stress. In recent years, studies have found that oxidative stress has other effects on the body, such as anti-tumour. In this paper, the targets related to anti-oxidative stress were introduced, and they were divided into nuclear transcription factors, enzymes, solute carrier family 7, member 11 (SLC7A11) genes and iron death, ion channels, molecular chaperones, small molecules according to their different functions. In addition, we introduce the research status of agonists/inhibitors related to these targets, so as to provide some reference for the follow-up research and clinical application of anti-oxidative stress drugs.",

However, their potential for application in regenerative medicine declines when the levels of the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) increase from the physiological levels, a phenomenon which is at least inevitable in ex vivo cultures and air-exposed damaged tissues. Increased levels of RONS can alter the patterns of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and inhibit proliferation, as well. Besides, oxidative stress enhances senescence and cell death, thus lowering the success rates of the MSC engraftment. Hence, in this review, we have selected some representatives of antioxidants and newly emerged nano antioxidants in three main categories, including chemical compounds, biometabolites, and protein precursors/proteins, which are proved to be effective in the treatment of MSCs. We will focus on how antioxidants can be applied to optimize the clinical usage of the MSCs and their associated signaling pathways. We have also reviewed several paralleled properties of some antioxidants and nano antioxidants which can be simultaneously used in real-time imaging, scaffolding techniques, and other applications in addition to their primary antioxidative function.",

The present study aimed to review available investigations surrounding the clinical and pharmacological properties of Spirulina that have been carried out so far. Databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science were searched for relevant literature using the keywords: (Spirulina), (pharmacology), and (clinical). About 130 papers that studied the pharmacological characteristics of Spirulina in animal models, as well as clinical trials, were selected from the beginning to 29 July 2021. According to this review, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-neoplastic, hypolipidemic, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antimicrobial, anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetic, and radio-protective functions are attributed to Spirulina. Moreover, Spirulina's positive influence on several organs, including hair, skin, liver, CNS, lung, and genitourinary tract, are ascribed to different components of various species of Spirulina such as Spirulina platensis, Spirulina fusiformis, and Spirulina maxima. Although so many studies have been accomplished on every aspect of Spirulina in recent years, the lack of a comprehensive investigation surrounding this microalga encouraged us to prepare this paper. Therefore, the present study could be considered an up-to-date overview of the clinical, pharmacological, and molecular aspects of Spirulina, resulting in more occupational research on this valuable organism.",

With the gradual rise of natural product development, plant polyphenols have gradually become one of the research hotspots in the field of food science due to their wide distribution in the plants, and the diversity of physiological functions. Owing to the extraordinary antioxidant and antibacterial activity of polyphenols, plant-derived polyphenols offer an alternative to chemical additives used in the food industry, such as oil, seafood, meat, beverages, and food package materials. Based on this, this chapter provides an overview of the potential antioxidant and antibacterial mechanisms of plant polyphenols and their application in food preservation, it would be providing a reference for the future development of polyphenols in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Copper (Cu) was recently demonstrated to play a critical role in cellular physiological and biochemical processes, including energy production and maintenance, antioxidation and enzymatic activity, and signal transduction. Antioxidant 1 (ATOX1), a chaperone of Cu previously named human ATX1 homologue (HAH1), has been found to play an indispensable role in maintaining cellular Cu homeostasis, antioxidative stress, and transcriptional regulation. In the past decade, it has also been found to be involved in a variety of diseases, including numerous neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and metabolic diseases. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed that ATOX1 is involved in the regulation of cell migration, proliferation, autophagy, DNA damage repair (DDR), and death, as well as in organism development and reproduction. This review summarizes recent advances in the research on the diverse physiological and cytological functions of ATOX1 and the underlying mechanisms of its action in human health and diseases. The potential of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target is also discussed. This review aims to pose unanswered questions related to ATOX1 biology and explore the potential use of ATOX1 as a therapeutic target.",

      "abstract": "This comprehensive review investigates the pivotal role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cataract formation and evaluates the potential of antioxidant therapies in mitigating this ocular condition. By elucidating the mechanisms of oxidative stress, the article examines how ROS contribute to the deterioration of lens proteins and lipids, leading to the characteristic aggregation, cross-linking, and light scattering observed in cataracts. The review provides a thorough assessment of various antioxidant strategies aimed at preventing and managing cataracts, such as dietary antioxidants (i.e., vitamins C and E, lutein, and zeaxanthin), as well as pharmacological agents with antioxidative properties. Furthermore, the article explores innovative therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy and nanotechnology-based delivery systems, designed to bolster antioxidant defenses in ocular tissues. Concluding with a critical analysis of current research, the review offers evidence-based recommendations for optimizing antioxidant therapies. The current literature on the use of antioxidant therapies to prevent cataract formation is sparse. There is a lack of evidence-based conclusions; further clinical studies are needed to endorse the use of antioxidant strategies in patients to prevent cataractogenesis. However, personalized treatment plans considering individual patient factors and disease stages can be applied. This article serves as a valuable resource, providing insights into the potential of antioxidants to alleviate the burden of cataracts.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are secondary metabolites of microorganisms which play important roles in adhesion, protection, biofilm formation, and as a source of nutrition. Compared with polysaccharides obtained from animal and plant species, bacterial polysaccharides have significant advantages in terms of production cost and large-scale production due to their abundant metabolic pathways and efficient polysaccharide production capacity. Most extracellular polysaccharides are water-soluble, and some are insoluble, such as bacterial cellulose. Some soluble bacterial EPS also have biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities. These biological activities are mainly affected by the molecular weight, monosaccharide type, composition and structure of EPS. In recent years, bacterial EPS are considered as novel functional polysaccharides with important application prospects, especially in free radical scavenging and antioxidation. This review focuses on the characteristics of bacterial EPS, their ability to scavenge free radicals and their corresponding antioxidant mechanisms, and summarizes the relationship between different structures (such as monosaccharide composition, functional groups, molecular weight, etc.) and antioxidant activities. It provides a new idea for the development of more bioactive bacterial EPS antioxidants, points out a new direction for the commercial production of natural, safe and economical polysaccharide drugs and health products.",

      "abstract": "Our research focused on the hypoglycemic capability and the possible mechanisms of extract and fractions from Polygoni Avicularis Herba (PAH) based on α-glucosidase, α-amylase inhibition assays, glucose uptake experiment, HPLC-MS analysis, and molecular docking experiment. In addition, DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays were used for determining the antioxidant capability. The results of total flavonoids and phenolics contents showed that ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) possessed the highest flavonoids and phenolics with values of 159.7 ± 2.5 mg rutin equivalents/g and 107.6 ± 2.0 mg galic acid equivalents/g, respectively. The results of in vitro hypoglycemic activity showed that all samples had effective α-glucosidase inhibition capacities, and EAF possessed the best inhibitory effect with IC50 value of 1.58 ± 0.24 μg/mL. In addition, n-butanol fraction (NBF) significantly promoted the glucose uptake rate of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. HPLC-MS analysis and molecular docking results proved the interactions between candidates and α-glucosidase. The results of antioxidation capacities showed that EAF possessed the best antioxidation abilities with DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP. In summary, the hypoglycemic activity of PAH might be related to the inhibition of α-glucosidase (EAF > PEF > NBF) and the promotion of glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (NBF). Simultaneously, the antioxidation capacity of PAH might be related to the abundant contents of flavonoids and other phenolics (EAF > PEF > NBF).",

      "abstract": "Infertility is one of the significant global issues that affects approximately 15-17 % of couples worldwide, with around 50 % of cases being attributed to female infertility factors. The exploration of herbal extracts and their effects on female infertility has been limited, particularly regarding the underlying mechanisms beyond hormonal and oxidative stress influences. In this study, the herbal medicines with potential effects such as antioxidative properties, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, and modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis have been reviewed. Several herbal extracts were found to exhibit significant antioxidant properties and demonstrate phytoestrogenic effects on reproductive factors and hormonal levels. Antioxidants are essential in mitigating oxidative stress by neutralizing free radicals, which in turn helps to lower insulin resistance, total cholesterol, fat accumulation, and the proliferation of cancerous cells. Furthermore, this review highlights that certain parts of specific plants are rich in polyphenolic compounds, including isoflavones and flavonoids, along with other advantageous substances that support women's reproductive health. These compounds not only modulate female endocrine systems but also alleviate menopausal symptoms and effectively address a range of reproductive disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), premature ovarian failure (POF), endometriosis, hyperprolactinemia, and hypothalamic dysfunction. Turning to the other side, the plants and herbal extracts with suppressive effects on female fertility have been reviewed. These findings indicated that herbal extracts could be exploited to develop natural products as supplements for supporting the female reproductive system.",

Several of them exerted potent scavenging capacity towards ABTS radical and hydrogen peroxide. The insight into the preferable antioxidative mechanism was reached employing density functional theory. In the absence of free radicals, the SPLET mechanism is dominant in polar surroundings, while HAT is prevailing in a non-polar environment. The results obtained for the reactions of the most active compounds with some medically relevant radicals pointed out competition between HAT and SPLET mechanisms. The assessment of their cytotoxic properties revealed inhibition of ER-a human breast adenocarcinoma cells or estrogen-independent prostate cancer cells. Molecular docking study with the cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 enzyme was performed to examine the most probable bioactive conformations and possible interactions between the tested derivatives and COX-2 binding pocket.",

In this study, a novel polysaccharide fraction, named SLP-2, was isolated from Stauntonia leucantha fruits, and purified by DEAE-52 and Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. Furthermore, SLP-2 was identified by congo red, methylation, partial acid hydrolysis and NMR. The results indicated that the backbone of SLP-2 was composed of →4)-β-D-Galp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Galp-(1→ substituted at C-6 with 1,5-linked arabinan. SLP-2 had good anti-oxidation ability in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that reduction of carboxyl groups and methylation of hydroxyl groups enhanced the ability to scavenge 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) radicals and inhibit lipid peroxidation, and weakened the activity to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals and reduce ferric iron.",

However, current wound dressing designs lack consideration of the wound microenvironment of diabetic patients, making diabetic wound tissue repair a challenge. Here, we report a wound dressing (SSD-PG-PVA/KGM) with a porous structure and anti-oxidant properties for promoting diabetic wound tissue repair. First, the porous structure created by electrospinning technology encourages cell proliferation and migration in the wound while also providing breathability and moisture retention. Second, adding natural polyphenols (PG) and saikosaponins (SSDs) to the wound reduced reactive oxygen species levels and oxide stress. In vitro cell experiments showed that SSD-PG-PVA/KGM had good biocompatibility. Due to the biocompatibility, anti-oxidation ability, breathability, and moisturizing, SSD-PG-PVA/KGM could effectively promote the repair of diabetic wound tissue (the wound closure rate was 95.6% at 14 days).",

      "abstract": "Natural antioxidants are always considered as candidates for the antioxidative therapy of atherosclerosis (AS) due to their good safety profile. However, restricted to their limited reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination and rapid metabolism, the natural antioxidants' treatment suffers from the undesirable clinical outcomes. Herein, a new natural antioxidant-based nanodrug (VC@cLAVs) that can overcome above issues is developed to treat AS by loading natural antioxidant vitamin C (VC) into the natural antioxidant lipoic acid (LA)-constructed cross-linked vesicles. This integration not only greatly increases the blood half-life of natural antioxidants, but also amplifies the antioxidation capacity by the mutual recycling of two redox pairs LA/DHLA (reduced form of LA) and VC/DHA (oxidized form of VC). In vivo results disclose that VC@cLAVs decreases the apolipoprotein E-deficient mice's plaque area from 52% to 13%, much lower than those of free VC (≈45%) and LA (≈38%). This natural antioxidant-based nanodrug holds great potential in clinics.",

FOXO target genes include genes encoding antioxidant proteins, thus likely contributing to the key role FOXOs play in the cellular response to oxidative stress and supporting the cellular strategies of antioxidant defense, that is, prevention (of the formation of reactive oxygen species), interception (of reactive species prior to their reaction with cellular components), repair (of damaged biomolecules), and adaptation (i.e., the stimulation of signaling pathways allowing for the expression of protective proteins). FOXOs themselves are regulated by redox processes at several levels, including expression of FOXO genes and enzymatic as well as nonenzymatic posttranslational modifications of FOXO proteins. The latter include modifications of FOXO cysteine residues. Here, an overview is provided on (i) the contribution of FOXO target genes to cellular antioxidative strategies, and (ii) on the impact of thiol homeostasis and thiol modification on FOXO activity.",

Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannin, flavonoids, glycosides, phenols, saponins, and terpenes in the crude intra- and extracellular ethyl acetate extracts of different strains. All fungal extracts exhibited effective antioxidant activities in terms of TPC, TFC, DPPH, FRAP, ABTS, reducing power, and metal chelating capacity. The activities of intracellular extracts were higher than the extracellular metabolites. Fermentation media with sugar and salt supplementation significantly influenced antioxidant production. Aspergillus niger in glucose-supplemented whey medium was found to exhibit the highest antioxidant properties. The antimicrobial activity of A. niger and Penicillium expansum extracts by microtiter plate assay showed a promising result against some pathogenic bacterial strains. Chromatographic analysis of the fungal extracts revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, ferulic acid quercetin, myricetin, kaempferol, and catechin which are known for their antioxidant properties. Accumulation of nutrients in fungal biomass under constraint environment produces secondary metabolites which has demonstrated efficacy towards alleviation of several degenerative diseases. The antioxidative enriched phytochemicals present in these five different fungal strains will provide a breakthrough in the utilisation of whey as inexpensive source of substrate for the growth of these fungi. Moreover, phytochemicals could be utilized as therapeutic agents in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner.",

      "abstract": "One of the most important factors involved in the response to oxidative stress (OS) is the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which regulates the expression of components such as antioxidative stress proteins and enzymes. Under normal conditions, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) keeps Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, thus preventing its translocation to the nucleus and inhibiting its role. It has been established that Nrf2 has a dual function; on the one hand, it promotes angiogenesis and cancer cell metastasis while causing resistance to drugs and chemotherapy. On the other hand, Nrf2 increases expression and proliferation of glutathione to protect cells against OS. p53 is a tumour suppressor that activates the apoptosis pathway in aging and cancer cells in addition to stimulating the glutaminolysis and antioxidant pathways. Cancer cells use the antioxidant ability of p53 against OS. Therefore, in the present study, we discussed function of Nrf2 and p53 in breast cancer (BC) cells to elucidate their role in protection or destruction of cancer cells as well as their drug resistance or antioxidant properties.",

      "abstract": "Vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate) plays an important role in regulating the health of the skin, promoting the differentiation of epithelial skin cells (keratinocytes) while contributing a notable role in the reduction of melanin synthesis, leading to antioxidative protection against solar-related skin damage. Vitamin C is only sourced from diet because humans have no ability to synthesise it in vivo. Routine dietary intake choices become key in maintaining the skin's integrity, preventing and treating some of the skin conditions encountered regularly by general practitioners and skin specialists alike. There is a strong association between vitamin C and the ageing process, skin pigmentation, control of certain skin diseases and a role in some skin cancers through antioxidation properties. Literature suggests that topical application of vitamin C in different forms of formulations has been demonstrated to have more clinical effect than oral intake.Contribution: This article spotlights the benefits of a vitamin commonly encountered in topical pharmaceutics, ingested as tablets or as part of our routine diet.",

      "abstract": "Rhoifolin (apigenin-7-O-β-neohesperidoside) belongs to the class of flavonoids and was reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, and cardioprotective activities. The current study presents the in-vitro evaluation of the antioxidative effects of rhoifolin by many assays, namely DPPH, CUPRAC, ABTS, phosphomolybdenum, and FRAP. Enzyme inhibitory potential was also evaluated for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, amylase, and glucosidase enzymes. While results revealed weak antioxidant activities for rhoifolin, the compound demonstrated some promising enzyme inhibitory effects against BChE (4.03 mg GALAE/g) and tyrosinase (7.44 mg KAE/g) but was not active on AChE. Regarding anti-diabetic enzymes, the compound was active on amylase but did not show any inhibition effect on glucosidase. In-silico molecular docking study was performed for rhoifolin on the active site of NADPH oxidase, BChE, and amylase enzymes to verify the observed enzyme inhibitory effect. Good binding affinities were observed for rhoifolin on all the docked enzymes, revealing numerous hydrogen bonds, carbon-hydrogen, van der Waals interactions. This is the first study to evaluate the enzyme inhibition potential of rhoifolin. We concluded that the increase in the degree of glycosylation might decrease the antioxidant abilities of flavonoids and that rhoifolin had moderate enzyme inhibition abilities to be investigated in future studies.",

In this study, the synergistic effect of dihydrosphingosine (d18:0) and α-tocopherol was studied on pure docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) triacylglycerols with an omics-type liquid- and gas-chromatographic mass spectrometric approach to verify the synergistic effect, to get a comprehensive view on the effect of d18:0 on the oxidation pattern, and to identify the lipation products. The results confirmed that d18:0 rapidly reacts further in the presence of lipid oxidation products and α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol and d18:0 showed an improved antioxidative effect after 12 h of oxidation, indicating the formation of antioxidants through carbonyl-amine reactions. Imines formed from the carbonyls and d18:0 could be tentatively identified.",

      "abstract": "The objective of anti-aging medicine is to decelerate the aging process and mitigate its associated effects, such as susceptibility to cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. This review provides an overview of the latest advancements in this field, considering both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical approaches. Electronic literature search involved three databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar, supplemented by other available literature. Strategies for delaying aging and related diseases comprise pharmaceutical interventions and lifestyle choices. It is crucial for these strategies to be substantiated by research-based evidence. Lifestyle options include fasting, fasting-mimicking, and ketogenic diets. Anti-aging drugs and supplements operate through diverse mechanisms. Calorie restriction mimetics include the activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (metformin) and inhibitor of mTOR (rapamycin), alongside rilmenidine, exhibiting both effects. Rosmarinic acid, a natural product, functions through its anti-glycation properties. Age-related protein crosslinks are acknowledged as a causative factor in age-related diseases. Anti-aging medicine is an evolving field with a multitude of drugs and strategies, necessitating further clinical studies and long-term follow-up based on clinical experience and insights gained from delayed adverse events.",

      "title": "Research Advances on the Damage Mechanism of Skin Glycation and Related Inhibitors.",
      "abstract": "Our skin is an organ with the largest contact area between the human body and the external environment. Skin aging is affected directly by both endogenous factors and exogenous factors (e.g., UV exposure). Skin saccharification, a non-enzymatic reaction between proteins, e.g., dermal collagen and naturally occurring reducing sugars, is one of the basic root causes of endogenous skin aging. During the reaction, a series of complicated glycation products produced at different reaction stages and pathways are usually collectively referred to as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGEs cause cellular dysfunction through the modification of intracellular molecules and accumulate in tissues with aging. AGEs are also associated with a variety of age-related diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal failure (uremia), and Alzheimer's disease. AGEs accumulate in the skin with age and are amplified through exogenous factors, e.g., ultraviolet radiation, resulting in wrinkles, loss of elasticity, dull yellowing, and other skin problems. This article focuses on the damage mechanism of glucose and its glycation products on the skin by summarizing the biochemical characteristics, compositions, as well as processes of the production and elimination of AGEs. One of the important parts of this article would be to summarize the current AGEs inhibitors to gain insight into the anti-glycation mechanism of the skin and the development of promising natural products with anti-glycation effects.",

Glycation is a non-enzymatic reaction between macromolecules and sugars causing alterations to the elastic fibers and premature aging of the skin. Glycation can be prevented by a range of bioactive molecules; however, at present only a few of them are validated for inclusion in cosmetic products. There is also a demand for reproducible in-vitro assays demonstrating the anti-aging effect of compounds on the skin. This study aimed to define the potential targets for screening and validation of anti-glycation activity of novel cosmetic candidates from natural products and to provide a plausible mechanism for their anti-aging potential based on 3D skin models.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy is a tissue-specific neurovascular impairment of the retina in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Several pathological factors are involved in the progressive impairment of the interdependence between cells that consist of the neurovascular units (NVUs). The advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are one of the major pathological factors that cause the impairments of neurovascular coupling in diabetic retinopathy. Although the exact mechanisms for the toxicities of the AGEs in diabetic retinopathy have not been definitively determined, the AGE-receptor of the AGE (RAGE) axis, production of reactive oxygen species, inflammatory reactions, and the activation of the cell death pathways are associated with the impairment of the NVUs in diabetic retinopathy. More specifically, neuronal cell death is an irreversible change that is directly associated with vision reduction in diabetic patients. Thus, neuroprotective therapies must be established for diabetic retinopathy. The AGEs are one of the therapeutic targets to examine to ameliorate the pathological changes in the NVUs in diabetic retinopathy. This review focuses on the basic and pathological findings of AGE-induced neurovascular abnormalities and the potential therapeutic approaches, including the use of anti-glycated drugs to protect the AGE-induced impairments of the NVUs in diabetic retinopathy.",

The analytical techniques used (UV-Vis, FT-IR, CHN/S) confirmed the bidentate nature of the ligand, coordinating via O and N atoms in 2:1 ligand-to-metal ratio. The TG/DTA anylsis displayed that these compounds are thermally stable. Furthermore, the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their anti-glycation and antioxidant potential and showed significant activities with IC50 values range 184.11-386.34 µM and 37.05-126.27 µM, respectively. The Mn (IC50 = 184.11 ± 2.11 µM), Ni (IC50 = 211.26 ± 1.46 µM), Cu (IC50 = 254.56 ± 1.16 µM), and Zn (IC50 = 276.43 ± 2.14 µM) metal complexes exhibited substantial anti-glycation activity and comparatively better activity than the standard rutin (IC50 = 294.4 ± 1.50 µM), whereas Zn complex (IC50 = 37.05 ± 1.53 μM) also showed better DPPH radical scavenging activity than the standard tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole (IC50 = 44.7 ± 1.21 µM).",

The results indicated that OPOs mainly included two components, and the main component has more than 50 % inhibition level for the seven glycation products at 60 °C for 40 h. At the accelerated storage temperature, OPOs demonstrated a better anti-glycation level than AG, and this inhibition was concentration-dependent. In addition, the main component in OPOs was separated into 10 fractions by DEAE Sephadex A-25 gel chromatography, the group of 5-7 monosaccharide polymerization showed the best anti-glycation effect, average anti-glycation capability on six products was over 70 % in the 40th hour. The anti-glycation level of this group was closely related to its high content of GalA and molar ratio of GalA: Rha, and positively correlated with time at moderate temperature.",

      "abstract": "The advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are produced through non-enzymatic glycation between reducing sugars and free amino groups, such as proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. AGEs can enter the body through daily dietary intake and can also be generated internally via normal metabolism and external stimuli. AGEs bind to cell surface receptors for AGEs, triggering oxidative stress and inflammation responses that lead to skin ageing and various diseases. Evidence shows that AGEs contribute to skin dysfunction and ageing. This review introduces the basic information, the sources, the metabolism and absorption of AGEs. We also summarise the detrimental mechanisms of AGEs to skin ageing and other chronic diseases. For the potential strategies for counteracting AGEs to skin and other organs, we summarised the pathways that could be utilised to resist glycation. Chemical and natural-derived anti-glycation approaches are overviewed. This work offers an understanding of AGEs to skin ageing and other chronic diseases and may provide perspectives for the development of anti-glycation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The structure of natural proteins has inspired the hypothesis that L-carnosine (LC), acetyl carnosine (AC), and decarboxy carnosine (DC) self-assemble into highly bioactive carnosine with supramolecular structures. These structures are proposed to combat skin pigmentation and aging through the coordination of weak interactions between molecules. Simulations are conducted to ascertain the precise free energies of the potential supramolecular structures and to identify the equilibrium structure. The mechanism of transdermal action of supramolecular carnosine is investigated through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The results demonstrate that supramolecular carnosine exhibits a more pronounced reactivity with the skin than LC, primarily due to the interaction of AC and DC with the lipid matrix, which reduces interfacial resistance. The anti-photoaging and anti-glycation cell models demonstrate that supramolecular carnosine upregulates the expression of the Nrf2 protein, activates the antioxidant defense system of melanocytes, inhibits the expression of the receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs), and reduces the level of AGEs in vivo. Moreover, supramolecular carnosine has demonstrated satisfactory whitening efficacy in cells and clinical efficacy tests, thereby underscoring its considerable potential for biomedical and aesthetic applications.",

      "title": "Anti-glycating and anti-cytotoxic effect of silibinin on albumin at early glycation: A physiochemical study.",
      "abstract": "During persistent hyperglycaemia, albumin, one of the major blood proteins, can undergo fast glycation. It can be expected that timely inhibition of protein glycation might be add quality years to diabetic patients' life. Therefore, this study was designed to analyse the role of silibinin to reduced or delay amadori adduct formation at early glycation and its beneficial effect to improve the glycated albumin structure and conformation. We also analysed cytotoxic effect of amadori-albumin in the presence of silibinin on murine macrophage cell line RAW cells by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Formation of early glycated product (furosine) in all samples was confirmed by LCMS. Albumin incubated with glucose only showed presence of furosine like structure. Albumin treated with silibinin in the presence of glucose did not show such furosine like peak. This LCMS result showed the silibinin play a protective role in the formation of early glycated product. HMF contents were also reduced in the presence of silibinin, when albumin was incubated with increasing concentrations of silibinin (100 and 200 μM) in the presence of glucose. ANS binding fluorescence decrease by increasing silibinin concentrations with amadori-albumin. SDS-PAGE was also showed that no significant difference in the band mobility of albumin treated with silibinin as compared to native albumin. The secondary conformational alteration in amadori-albumin due to silibinin were conﬁrmed by FTIR. This spectrum showed slight shift in amide I and Amide II band in albumin co-incubated with glucose and silibinin as compared to albumin incubated with glucose only. We further discussed about cytotoxic effect of amadori albumin and its prevention by silibinin. MTT assay results demonstrated that amadori-albumin showed cytotoxic effect on RAW cells but silibinin showed protective role and increased the cell viability. Moreover, the results showed that silibinin has anti-glycating potential and playing a role to prevent the formation of Amadori-albumin in-vitro. Silibinin possesses strong anti-glycating capacity and can improve albumin structure and function at early stage. It might be useful in delaying the progression of diabetes mellitus and its secondary complications at early stage.",

A sedentary lifestyle, hypercaloric and high-fructose diet and increased intake of processed food elements contribute to excessive production of compounds, which are created in the non-enzymatic multi-stage glycation process. The AGE's sources can be endogenous and exogenous, mainly due to processing food at high temperatures and low moisture, including grilling, roasting, and frying. Accumulation of AGE increases oxidative stress and initiates various disorders, leading to the progression of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and their complications. Inborn defensive mechanisms, recovery systems, and exogenous antioxidants (including polyphenols) protect from excessive AGE accumulation. Additionally, numerous products have anti-glycation properties, occurring mainly in fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices. It confirms the role of diet in the prevention of civilization diseases.",

Banana blossoms are a by-product of banana harvesting rich in active substances such as polysaccharides and phenolic compounds; however, these blossoms are typically discarded as waste. In this report, a polysaccharide, MSBP11, was extracted, purified and identified from banana blossoms. MSBP11 is a neutral homogeneous polysaccharide with a molecular mass of ∼214.43 kDa and composed of arabinose and galactose at a ratio of 0.303:0.697. MSBP11 exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-glycation activities in a dose-dependent manner and can be used as a potential natural antioxidant and inhibitor of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs). In addition, banana blossoms have been shown to decrease the levels of AGEs in chocolate brownies, which might possibly be developed as functional foods for diabetic patients. This study provides a scientific basis to further research the potential application of banana blossoms in functional foods.",

      "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is well known for its many beneficial activities, but its unfavorable physicochemical properties impair its effectiveness after systemic and topical administration; thus, several strategies have been investigated to improve RSV efficacy. With this aim, in this work, we synthesized a novel RSV triester with trolox, an analogue of vitamin E with strong antioxidant activity. The new RSV derivative (RSVTR) was assayed in vitro to evaluate its antioxidant and anti-glycation activity compared to RSV. RSVTR chemical stability was assessed at pH 2.0, 6.8, and 7.2 and different storage temperatures (5 °C, 22 °C, and 37 °C). An influence of pH stronger than that of temperature on RSVTR half-life values was pointed out, and RSVTR greatest stability was observed at pH 7.2 and 5 °C. RSVTR showed a lower antioxidant ability compared to RSV (determined by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay) while its anti-glycation activity (evaluated using the Maillard reaction) was significantly greater than that of RSV. The improved ability to inhibit the glycation process was attributed to a better interaction of RSVTR with albumin owing to its increased topological polar surface area value and H-bond acceptor number compared to RSV. Therefore, RSVTR could be regarded as a promising anti-glycation agent worthy of further investigations.",

      "title": "Optimizing glycation control in diabetes: An integrated approach for inhibiting nonenzymatic glycation reactions of biological macromolecules.",
      "abstract": "Diabetes is a multifactorial disorder that increases mortality and disability due to its complications. A key driver of these complications is nonenzymatic glycation, which generates advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that impair tissue function. Therefore, effective nonenzymatic glycation prevention and control strategies are urgently needed. This review comprehensively describes the molecular mechanisms and pathological consequences of nonenzymatic glycation in diabetes and outlines various anti-glycation strategies, such as lowering plasma glucose, interfering with the glycation reaction, and degrading early and late glycation products. Diet, exercise, and hypoglycemic medications can reduce the onset of high glucose at the source. Glucose or amino acid analogs such as flavonoids, lysine and aminoguanidine competitively bind to proteins or glucose to block the initial nonenzymatic glycation reaction. In addition, deglycation enzymes such as amadoriase, fructosamine-3-kinase, parkinson's disease protein, glutamine amidotransferase-like class 1 domain-containing 3A and terminal FraB deglycase can eliminate existing nonenzymatic glycation products. These strategies involve nutritional, pharmacological, and enzymatic interventions that target different stages of nonenzymatic glycation. This review also emphasizes the therapeutic potential of anti-glycation drugs for preventing and treating diabetes complications.",

      "abstract": "A total of 147 oral Kampo prescriptions, which are used clinically in Japan, were evaluated for their anti-glycation activity. Kakkonto demonstrated significant anti-glycation activity, prompting further analysis of its chemical constituents using LC-MS, which revealed the presence of two alkaloids, fourteen flavonoids, two but-2-enolides, five monoterpenoids, and four triterpenoid glycosides. To identify the components responsible for its anti-glycation activity, the Kakkonto extract was reacted with glyceraldehyde (GA) or methylglyoxal (MGO) and analyzed using LC-MS. In LC-MS analysis of Kakkonto reacted with GA, the peak intensity of ephedrine was attenuated, and three products from ephedrine-scavenging GA were detected. Similarly, LC-MS analysis of Kakkonto reacted with MGO revealed two products from ephedrine reacting with MGO. These results indicated that ephedrine was responsible for the observed anti-glycation activity of Kakkonto. Ephedrae herba extract, which contains ephedrine, also showed strong anti-glycation activity, further supporting ephedrine's contribution to Kakkonto's reactive carbonyl species' scavenging ability and anti-glycation activity.",

      "abstract": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the final products of the Maillard reaction, formed through the interaction of carbohydrates and proteins. Reactive dicarbonyl compounds such as methylglyoxal (MGO) serve as precursors for AGEs formation. Elevated levels of MGO/AGEs are observed in conditions like obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), and diabetes, negatively impacting oocyte development. Previous studies have shown that hydrogen sulfide, a gasotransmitter with anti-AGEs effects, is produced in a process influenced by vitamin B6. R-α-lipoic acid (ALA) inhibits protein glycation and AGEs formation while stimulating glutathione (GSH) production. Taurine mitigates oxidative stress and acts as an anti-glycation compound, preventing in vitro glycation and AGEs accumulation. This study aimed to explore the ameliorative effects of a micronutrient support (Taurine, ALA and B6: TAB) on mouse oocytes challenged with MGO. Our results indicate that MGO reduces oocyte developmental competence, while TAB supplementation improves maturation, fertilization, and blastocyst formation rates. TAB also restores cell lineage allocation, redox balance and mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction in MGO-challenged oocytes. Furthermore, cumulus cells express key enzymes in the transsulfuration pathway, and TAB enhances their mRNA expression. However, TAB does not rescue MGO-induced damage in denuded oocytes, emphasizing the supportive role of cumulus cells. Overall, these findings suggest that TAB interventions may have significant implications for addressing reproductive dysfunctions associated with elevated MGO/AGEs levels. This study highlights the potential of TAB supplementation in preserving the developmental competence of COCs exposed to MGO stress, providing insights into mitigating the impact of dicarbonyl stress on oocyte quality and reproductive outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Maintaining quality of life with an increase in life expectancy is considered one of the global problems of our time. This review explores the possibility of using natural plant compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-glycation, and anti-neurodegenerative properties to slow down the onset of age-related changes. Age-related changes such as a decrease in mental abilities, the development of inflammatory processes, and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes have a significant impact on maintaining quality of life. Herbal preparations can play an essential role in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases that accompany age-related changes, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Medicinal plants have known sedative, muscle relaxant, neuroprotective, nootropic, and antiparkinsonian properties. The secondary metabolites, mainly polyphenolic compounds, are valuable substances for the development of new anti-inflammatory and hypoglycemic agents. Understanding how mixtures of plants and their biologically active substances work together to achieve a specific biological effect can help develop targeted drugs to prevent diseases associated with aging and age-related changes. Understanding the mechanisms of the biological activity of plant complexes and mixtures determines the prospects for using metabolomic and biochemical methods to prolong active longevity.",

However, traditional chemical synthesis and plant extraction methods are impractical for industrial resveratrol production because of low yield, toxic chemical solvents and environmental pollution during the production process. Recently, the biosynthesis of resveratrol by constructing microbial cell factories has attracted much attention, because it provides a safe and efficient route for the resveratrol production. This review discusses the physiological functions and market applications of resveratrol. In addition, recent significant biotechnology advances in resveratrol biosynthesis are systematically summarized. Furthermore, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects for strain development for large-scale resveratrol production at an industrial level.",

However, there has been insufficient information to explain BWAs in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity owing to its limited solubility in an aqueous buffer system. Herein, three distinct reconstituted high-density lipoproteins (rHDL) were prepared with palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and BWA at molar ratios of 95:5:1:0 (rHDL-0), 95:5:1:0.5 (rHDL-0.5), and 95:5:1:1 (rHDL-1) and examined for antioxidant and anti-glycation effects. A rHDL containing BWA, precisely rHDL-1, displayed a remarkable anti-glycation effect against fructose (final 250 mM), induced glycation of HDL, and prevented proteolytic degradation of apoA-I. Also, BWA incorporated rHDL-0.5, and rHDL-1 displayed substantial antioxidant activity by inhibiting cupric ion-mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. In contrast to rHDL-0, a 20 and 22% enhancement in ferric ion reduction ability (FRA) and paraoxonase (PON) activity was observed in HDL treated with rHDL-1, signifying the effect of BWA on the antioxidant activity enhancement of HDL. rHDL-1 efficiently inhibits ",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress contributes not only to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) but also to diabetic vascular complications. It follows that antioxidants might contribute to limiting the diabetes burden. In this review we focus on ellagic acid (EA), a compound that can be obtained upon intestinal hydrolysis of dietary ellagitannins, a family of polyphenols naturally found in several fruits and seeds. There is increasing research on cardiometabolic effects of ellagitannins, EA, and urolithins (EA metabolites). We updated research conducted on these compounds and (I) glucose metabolism; (II) inflammation, oxidation, and glycation; and (III) diabetic complications. We included studies testing EA in isolation, extracts or preparations enriched in EA, or EA-rich foods (mostly pomegranate juice). Animal research on the topic, entirely conducted in murine models, mostly reported glucose-lowering, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-glycation effects, along with prevention of micro- and macrovascular diabetic complications. Clinical research is incipient and mostly involved non-randomized and low-powered studies, which confirmed the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of EA-rich foods, but without conclusive results on glucose control. Overall, EA-related compounds might be potential agents to limit the diabetes burden, but well-designed human randomized controlled trials are needed to fill the existing gap between experimental and clinical research.",

      "title": "Amazonian Melastomataceae blueberries: Determination of phenolic content, nutritional composition, and antioxidant and anti-glycation activities.",
      "abstract": "Berries come from hundreds of different species of plants spread around the world. Blackberries, blueberries and raspberries, for instance, are popular berries that have attracted attention for providing several benefits to human health. Wild berries from the Melastomataceae family are commonly encountered in the Amazon, although these small blue fruits are poorly consumed. Although domesticated fruits give better monetary profits, the consumption of wild fruits is a desirable option to afford income and/or food to communities at the same time as keep the Amazon region preserved. Aiming the divulgation of the nutritional potential of these plants, this paper describes the study of six species of Amazonian blueberries, five of them from the Clidemia genus and one from the Tococa genus, in regard to their nutritional and chemical composition and antioxidant activity (AA). The levels of moisture, ash, protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and the total caloric values obtained for the Amazonian blueberries were comparable to other common edible berries. Although the six species are similar in terms of nutritional composition, their anthocyanin profiles and contents are quite peculiar. Two non-methylated anthocyanins, cyanidin and delphinidin, which bound to a variable number of sugars, characterized the berries of the genera Clidemia and Tococa. Clidemia japurensis, Clidemia hirta and Tococa bullifera were rich in tri-glycosylated anthocyanins, although differences are notable between them. Clidemia pustulata and Clidemia capitellata were characterized by the prevalence of mono-glycosylated anthocyanins, and Clidemia rubra showed a unique profile with mono- and di-glycosylated homologous as the main anthocyanins. In addition to their different chemical profiles, the concentrations of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds varied a lot among the six species studied. The species C. rubra had the highest total concentration of phenolic acids and flavonoids. Therefore, this study showed that the blueberries analyzed have potential to be better explored, which we suggest doing in a sustainable way, aiming at the preservation of the Amazon's biodiversity.",

      "abstract": "The kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SA) ranks fifth in Asia in terms of area. It features broad biodiversity, including interesting flora, and was the historical origin of Islam. It is endowed with a large variety of plants, including many herbs, shrubs, and trees. Many of these plants have a long history of use in traditional medicine. The aim of this review is to evaluate the present knowledge on the plants growing in SA regarding their pharmacological and biological activities and the identification of their bioactive compounds to determine which plants could be of interest for further studies. A systematic summary of the plants' history, distribution, various pharmacological activities, bioactive compounds, and clinical trials are presented in this paper to facilitate future exploration of their therapeutic potential. The literature was obtained from several scientific search engines, including Sci-Finder, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Scopus, MDPI, Wiley publications, and Springer Link. Plant names and their synonyms were validated by 'The Plant List' on 1 October 2021. SA is home to approximately 2247 plant species, including native and introduced plants that belong to 142 families and 837 genera. It shares the flora of three continents, with many unique features due to its extreme climate and geographical and geological conditions. As plants remain the leading supplier of new therapeutic agents to treat various ailments, Saudi Arabian plants may play a significant role in the fight against cancer, inflammation, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To date, 102 active compounds have been identified in plants from different sites in SA. Plants from the western and southwestern regions have been evaluated for various biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, antimicrobial, antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, anti-glycation, and cytotoxic activities. The aerial parts of the plants, especially the leaves, have yielded most of the bioactive compounds. Most bioactivity tests involve in vitro assessments for the inhibition of the growth of tumour cell lines, and several compounds with in vitro antitumour activity have been reported. More in-depth studies to evaluate the mode of action of the compounds are necessary to pave the way for clinical trials. Ecological and taxonomical studies are needed to evaluate the flora of SA, and a plan for the conservation of wild plants should be implemented, including the management of the protection of endemic plants.",

      "abstract": "Garlic has been reported to inhibit protein glycation, a process that underlies several disease processes, including chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. Biophysical, biochemical, and molecular docking investigations were conducted to assess anti-glycating, antioxidant, and protein structural protection activities of garlic. Results from spectral (UV and fluorescence) and circular dichroism (CD) analysis helped ascertain protein conformation and secondary structure protection against glycation to a significant extent. Further, garlic showed heat-induced protein denaturation inhibition activity (52.17%). It also inhibited glycation, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation as well as lent human serum albumin (HSA) protein structural stability, as revealed by reduction in browning intensity (65.23%), decrease in protein aggregation index (67.77%), and overall reduction in cross amyloid structure formation (33.26%) compared with positive controls (100%). The significant antioxidant nature of garlic was revealed by FRAP assay (58.23%) and DPPH assay (66.18%). Using molecular docking analysis, some of the important garlic metabolites were investigated for their interactions with the HSA molecule. Molecular docking analysis showed quercetin, a phenolic compound present in garlic, appears to be the most promising inhibitor of glucose interaction with the HSA molecule. Our findings show that garlic can prevent oxidative stress and glycation-induced biomolecular damage and that it can potentially be used in the treatment of several health conditions, including diabetes and other inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "Non-enzymatic reaction involving carbonyl of reducing sugars and amino groups in proteins produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs). AGE accumulation in vivo is a crucial factor in the progression of metabolic and pathophysiological mechanisms like obesity, diabetes, coronary artery disease, neurological disorders, and chronic renal failure. The body's own defense mechanism, synthetic inhibitors, and natural inhibitors can all help to prevent the glycation of proteins. Synthetic inhibitors have the potential to suppress the glycation of proteins through a variety of pathways. They could avoid Amadori product development by tampering with the addition of sugars to the proteins. Besides which, the free radical scavenging and blocking crosslink formation could be another mechanism behind their anti-glycation properties. In comparison with synthetic substances, naturally occurring plant products have been found to be comparatively non-toxic, cheap, and usable in an ingestible form. This review gives a brief introduction of the Maillard reaction; formation, characterization and pathology related to AGEs, potential therapeutic approaches against glycation, natural and synthetic inhibitors of glycation and their probable mechanism of action. The scientific community could get benefit from the combined knowledge about important molecules, which will further guide to the design and development of new pharmaceutical compounds.",

      "abstract": "Oral dryness is among the most common conditions experienced by the elderly. As saliva plays a crucial role in maintaining oral health and overall quality of life, the condition is increasingly taking its toll on a rapidly growing aging population. D-galactose (D-gal) stimulates their formation, which in turn cause oxidative stress and accelerate age-related decline in physical function. In this study, we observed a reduction in salivary secretion and amylase levels in aged rats injected with D-gal, confirming salivary gland dysfunction. Treatment with gemigliptin increased DPP-4 inhibition and GLP-1 levels in the salivary glands of aging rats and reduced the expression of AGEs and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). This effect was caused by the presence of additional reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the salivary glands of the examined rats. Gemigliptin's cytoprotective effect reduced amylase and mucin accumulation and increased AQP5 expression, which are important indicators of salivary gland function. In sum, gemigliptin was shown to improve D-gal-induced decline in the salivary gland function of aged rats through its anti-glycation and antioxidant activities. Gemigliptin shows promise as a treatment strategy for patients experiencing decreased salivary function associated with their advancing age.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRTs) are nicotine adenine dinucleotide(+)-dependent histone deacetylases regulating critical signaling pathways in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and are involved in numerous biological processes. Currently, seven mammalian homologs of yeast Sir2 named SIRT1 to SIRT7 have been identified. Increasing evidence has suggested the vital roles of seven members of the SIRT family in health and disease conditions. Notably, this protein family plays a variety of important roles in cellular biology such as inflammation, metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, etc., thus, it is considered a potential therapeutic target for different kinds of pathologies including cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and other conditions. Moreover, identification of SIRT modulators and exploring the functions of these different modulators have prompted increased efforts to discover new small molecules, which can modify SIRT activity. Furthermore, several randomized controlled trials have indicated that different interventions might affect the expression of SIRT protein in human samples, and supplementation of SIRT modulators might have diverse impact on physiological function in different participants. In this review, we introduce the history and structure of the SIRT protein family, discuss the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of seven members of the SIRT protein family, elaborate on the regulatory roles of SIRTs in human disease, summarize SIRT inhibitors and activators, and review related clinical studies.",

Multiple signaling pathways that regulate metabolism also play critical roles in aging, such as PI3K/AKT, mTOR, AMPK, and sirtuins (SIRTs). Among them, sirtuins are known as a protein family with versatile functions, such as metabolic control, epigenetic modification and lifespan extension. Therefore, by understanding how sirtuins regulate metabolic processes, we can start to understand how they slow down or accelerate biological aging from the perspectives of metabolic regulation. Here, we review the biology of SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5, known as the mitochondrial sirtuins due to their localization in the mitochondrial matrix. First, we will discuss canonical pathways that regulate metabolism more broadly and how these are integrated with aging regulation. Then, we will summarize the current knowledge about functional differences between SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 in metabolic control and integration in signaling networks. Finally, we will discuss how mitochondrial sirtuins regulate processes associated with aging and aging-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, epigenetic modifications have been widely researched. As humans age, environmental and genetic factors may drive inflammation and immune responses by influencing the epigenome, which can lead to abnormal autoimmune responses in the body. Currently, an increasing number of studies have emphasized the important role of epigenetic modification in the progression of autoimmune diseases. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are class III nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylases and SIRT-mediated deacetylation is an important epigenetic alteration. The SIRT family comprises seven protein members (namely, SIRT1-7). While the catalytic core domain contains amino acid residues that have remained stable throughout the entire evolutionary process, the N- and C-terminal regions are structurally divergent and contribute to differences in subcellular localization, enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. SIRT1 and SIRT2 are localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are mitochondrial, and SIRT6 and SIRT7 are predominantly found in the nucleus. SIRTs are key regulators of various physiological processes such as cellular differentiation, apoptosis, metabolism, ageing, immune response, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. We discuss the association between SIRTs and common autoimmune diseases to facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. As a group of NAD+-dependent III deacetylases, the sirtuin (SIRT1-7) family plays a very important role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and participates in the progress of NAFLD. SIRT family members are distributed in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria; regulate hepatic fatty acid oxidation metabolism through different metabolic pathways and mechanisms; and participate in the regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism. SIRT1 may improve NAFLD by regulating ROS, PGC-1α, SREBP-1c, FoxO1/3, STAT3, and AMPK to restore mitochondrial function and reduce steatosis of the liver. Other SIRT family members also play a role in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidative metabolism, inflammation, and insulin resistance. Therefore, this paper comprehensively introduces the role of SIRT family in regulating mitochondrial biogenesis in the liver in NAFLD, aiming to further explain the importance of SIRT family in regulating mitochondrial function in the occurrence and development of NAFLD, and to provide ideas for the research and development of targeted drugs. Relatively speaking, the role of some SIRT family members in NAFLD is still insufficiently clear, and further research is needed.",

      "title": "SIRT7: the seventh key to unlocking the mystery of aging.",
      "abstract": "Aging is a chronic yet natural physiological decline of the body. Throughout life, humans are continuously exposed to a variety of exogenous and endogenous stresses, which engender various counteractive responses at the cellular, tissue, organ, as well as organismal levels. The compromised cellular and tissue functions that occur because of genetic factors or prolonged stress (or even the stress response) may accelerate aging. Over the last two decades, the sirtuin (SIRT) family of lysine deacylases has emerged as a key regulator of longevity in a variety of organisms. SIRT7, the most recently identified member of the SIRTs, maintains physiological homeostasis and provides protection against aging by functioning as a watchdog of genomic integrity, a dynamic sensor and modulator of stresses. SIRT7 decline disrupts metabolic homeostasis, accelerates aging, and increases the risk of age-related pathologies including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, pulmonary and renal disorders, inflammatory diseases, and cancer, etc. Here, we present SIRT7 as the seventh key to unlock the mystery of aging, and its specific manipulation holds great potential to ensure healthiness and longevity.",

      "title": "SIRT5-related desuccinylation modification of AIFM1 protects against compression-induced intervertebral disc degeneration by regulating mitochondrial homeostasis.",
      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in the development of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) participates in the maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis through its desuccinylase activity. However, it is still unclear whether succinylation or SIRT5 is involved in the impairment of mitochondria and development of IDD induced by excessive mechanical stress. Our 4D label-free quantitative proteomic results showed decreased expression of the desuccinylase SIRT5 in rat nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues under mechanical loading. Overexpression of Sirt5 effectively alleviated, whereas knockdown of Sirt5 aggravated, the apoptosis and dysfunction of NP cells under mechanical stress, consistent with the more severe IDD phenotype of Sirt5 KO mice than wild-type mice that underwent lumbar spine instability (LSI) surgery. Moreover, immunoprecipitation-coupled mass spectrometry (IP-MS) results suggested that AIFM1 was a downstream target of SIRT5, which was verified by a Co-IP assay. We further demonstrated that reduced SIRT5 expression resulted in the increased succinylation of AIFM1, which in turn abolished the interaction between AIFM1 and CHCHD4 and thus led to the reduced electron transfer chain (ETC) complex subunits in NP cells. Reduced ETC complex subunits resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction and the subsequent occurrence of IDD under mechanical stress. Finally, we validated the efficacy of treatments targeting disrupted mitochondrial protein importation by upregulating SIRT5 expression or methylene blue (MB) administration in the compression-induced rat IDD model. In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the occurrence and development of IDD and offers promising therapeutic approaches for IDD.",

      "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, which can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) regulates NAFLD by regulating metabolism-related gene expression, but an extrachromosomal role for SIRT6 in NAFLD development remains elusive. We investigated whether SIRT6 functions on NAFLD in the cytoplasm. We found that SIRT6 binds saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid. This binding leads to its nuclear export, where it deacetylates long-chain acyl-CoA synthase 5 (ACSL5), thereby facilitating fatty acid oxidation. High-fat diet-induced NAFLD is suppressed by ACSL5 hepatic overexpression but is exacerbated by its depletion. As confirmation, overexpression of a deacetylated ACSL5 mimic attenuated NAFLD in Sirt6 liver-specific knockout mice. Moreover, NASH-hepatic tissues from both patients and diet-fed mice exhibited significantly reduced cytoplasmic SIRT6 levels and increased ACSL5 acetylation. The SIRT6/ACSL5 signaling pathway has a critical role in NAFLD progression and might constitute an avenue for therapeutic intervention.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuins are pro-longevity genes with chromatin modulation potential, but how these properties are connected is not well understood. Here, we generated a panel of isogeneic human stem cell lines with SIRT1-SIRT7 knockouts and found that any sirtuin deficiency leads to accelerated cellular senescence. Through large-scale epigenomic analyses, we show how sirtuin deficiency alters genome organization and that genomic regions sensitive to sirtuin deficiency are preferentially enriched in active enhancers, thereby promoting interactions within topologically associated domains and the formation of de novo enhancer-promoter loops. In all sirtuin-deficient human stem cell lines, we found that chromatin contacts are rewired to promote aberrant activation of the placenta-specific gene PAPPA, which controls the pro-senescence effects associated with sirtuin deficiency and serves as a potential aging biomarker. Based on our survey of the 3D chromatin architecture, we established connections between sirtuins and potential target genes, thereby informing the development of strategies for aging interventions.",

      "abstract": "Ageing is a phenomenon in which cells, tissues and organs undergo systemic pathological changes as individuals age, leading to the occurrence of ageing-related diseases and the end of life. It is associated with many phenotypes known as ageing characteristics, such as genomic instability, nutritional imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell senescence, stem cell depletion, and an altered microenvironment. The sirtuin family (SIRT), known as longevity proteins, is thought to delay ageing and prolong life, and mammals, including humans, have seven family members (SIRT1-7). SIRT4 has been studied less among the sirtuin family thus far, but it has been reported that it has important physiological functions in organisms, such as promoting DNA damage repair, participating in the energy metabolism of three substances, inhibiting inflammatory reactions and apoptosis, and regulating mitochondrial function. Recently, some studies have demonstrated the involvement of SIRT4 in age-related processes, but knowledge in this field is still scarce. Therefore, this review aims to analyse the relationship between SIRT4 and ageing characteristics as well as some age-related diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer).",

      "title": "Critical Reanalysis of the Mechanisms Underlying the Cardiorenal Benefits of SGLT2 Inhibitors and Reaffirmation of the Nutrient Deprivation Signaling/Autophagy Hypothesis.",
      "abstract": "SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors produce a distinctive pattern of benefits on the evolution and progression of cardiomyopathy and nephropathy, which is characterized by a reduction in oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, restoration of mitochondrial health and enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, a decrease in proinflammatory and profibrotic pathways, and preservation of cellular and organ integrity and viability. A substantial body of evidence indicates that this characteristic pattern of responses can be explained by the action of SGLT2 inhibitors to promote cellular housekeeping by enhancing autophagic flux, an effect that may be related to the action of these drugs to produce simultaneous upregulation of nutrient deprivation signaling and downregulation of nutrient surplus signaling, as manifested by an increase in the expression and activity of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase), SIRT1 (sirtuin 1), SIRT3 (sirtuin 3), SIRT6 (sirtuin 6), and PGC1-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α) and decreased activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The distinctive pattern of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors is abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of autophagy, AMPK, and sirtuins. In the clinical setting, the pattern of differentially increased proteins identified in proteomics analyses of blood collected in randomized trials is consistent with these findings. Clinical studies have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors promote gluconeogenesis, ketogenesis, and erythrocytosis and reduce uricemia, the hallmarks of nutrient deprivation signaling and the principal statistical mediators of the ability of SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce the risk of heart failure and serious renal events. The action of SGLT2 inhibitors to augment autophagic flux is seen in isolated cells and tissues that do not express SGLT2 and are not exposed to changes in environmental glucose or ketones and may be related to an ability of these drugs to bind directly to sirtuins or mTOR. Changes in renal or cardiovascular physiology or metabolism cannot explain the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors either experimentally or clinically. The direct molecular effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in isolated cells are consistent with the concept that SGLT2 acts as a nutrient surplus sensor, and thus, its inhibition causes enhanced nutrient deprivation signaling and its attendant cytoprotective effects, which can be abolished by specific inhibition or knockdown of AMPK, sirtuins, and autophagic flux.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the leading causes of chronic kidney disease characterized with renal fibrosis. This study aimed to investigate roles and mechanisms of sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) in hypertensive renal injury. Mini-pumps were implanted to male C57BL/6 mice to deliver angiotensin (Ang) Ⅱ (1.5 mg/kg/d) or saline for 2 weeks. Ang Ⅱ infusion resulted in marked increases in systolic blood pressure levels, renal ferroptosis and interstitial fibrosis in hypertensive mice, concomitantly with downregulated SIRT7 and Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) levels. Notably, administration of recombinant adeno-associated virus-SIRT7 or ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 effectively mitigated Ang Ⅱ-triggered renal ferroptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), interstitial fibrosis, renal functional and structural injury in hypertensive mice by blunting the KIM-1/NOX4 signaling and enforcing the KLF15/Nrf2 and xCT/GPX4 signaling, respectively. In primary cultured mouse renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), Ang Ⅱ pretreatment led to repressed SIRT7 expression and augmented ferroptosis as well as partial EMT, which were substantially antagonized by rhSIRT7 or ferrostatin-1 administration. Additionally, both Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 and KLF15 siRNA strikingly abolished the rhSIRT7-mediated beneficial roles in mouse renal TECs in response to Ang Ⅱ with reduced expression of Nrf2, xCT and GPX4. More importantly, ML385 administration remarkably amplified Ang Ⅱ-mediated ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in renal TECs, which were significantly reversed by ferrostatin-1. In conclusion, SIRT7 alleviates renal ferroptosis, lipid peroxidation, and partial EMT under hypertensive status by facilitating the KLF15/Nrf2 signaling, thereby mitigating renal fibrosis, injury and dysfunction. Targeting SIRT7 signaling serves as a promising strategy for hypertension and hypertensive renal injury.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are experiencing a rapid surge and are widely recognized as the leading cause of mortality in the current aging society. Given the multifactorial etiology of CVDs, understanding the intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms is imperative. Over the past 2 decades, many scientists have focused on Sirtuins, a family of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacylases. Sirtuins are highly conserved across species, from yeasts to primates, and play a crucial role in linking aging and diseases. Sirtuins participate in nearly all key physiological and pathological processes, ranging from embryogenic development to stress response and aging. Abnormal expression and activity of Sirtuins exist in many aging-related diseases, while their activation has shown efficacy in mitigating these diseases (eg, CVDs). In terms of research, this field has maintained fast, sustained growth in recent years, from fundamental studies to clinical trials. In this review, we present a comprehensive, up-to-date discussion on the biological functions of Sirtuins and their roles in regulating cardiovascular biology and CVDs. Furthermore, we highlight the latest advancements in utilizing Sirtuin-activating compounds and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide boosters as potential pharmacological targets for preventing and treating CVDs. The key unresolved issues in the field-from the chemicobiological regulation of Sirtuins to Sirtuin-targeted CVD investigations-are also discussed. This timely review could be critical in understanding the updated knowledge of Sirtuin biology in CVDs and facilitating the clinical accessibility of Sirtuin-targeting interventions.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRT) are unique posttranslational modification enzymes that utilize NAD + as co-substrate to remove acyl groups from lysine residues. SIRT act on variety of substrates and impact major metabolic process. All seven members of SIRT family are unique and targets wide range of cellular proteins in nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria for post-translational modification by acetylation (SIRT1, 2, 3, and 5) or ADP-ribosylation (SIRT4 and 6). Each member of SIRT family is distinct. SIRT2 was first to be discovered that incited research on mammalian SIRT. Enzymatic activities of SIRT 4 are yet to be elucidated while only SIRT7 is localized in nucleoli that govern the transcription of RNA polymerase I. SIRT 5 and 6 exhibit weakest deacetylase activity. Out of all SIRT analogs, SIRT1 is identified as nutrient sensor. Increased expression of only SIRT3 is linked with longevity in humans. Since SIRT is regulated by the bioenergetic state of the cell, nutrition impacts it but very few studies about diet-mediated effect on SIRT are reported. The present review elaborates distribution, specific biological role and prominent effect of all SIRT on vital human tissue along with highlighting need to trace molecular mechanisms and identifying foods that may augment it beneficially.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5), localized in the mitochondria, has been identified as a protein desuccinylase and demalonylase in the mitochondria since the depletion of SIRT5 boosted the global succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins. We investigated the role of SIRT5 in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and identified the mechanism regarding lysine demalonylation in this process. Wild-type and SIRT5 knockout mice were induced with DCM, and primary cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts extracted from wild-type and SIRT5 knockout mice were subjected to high glucose (HG). SIRT5 deficiency exacerbated myocardial injury in DCM mice, aggravated HG-induced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes, and intensified cardiomyocyte senescence, pyroptosis, and DNA damage. DCM-induced SIRT5 loss diminished glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1) protein stability, represented by significantly increased lysine malonylation (Mal-Lys) modification of GSTP1. SIRT5 overexpression alleviated DCM-related myocardial injury, which was reversed by GSTP1 knockdown. Reduced SIRT5 transcription in DCM resulted from the downregulation of SPI1. SPI1 promoted the transcription of SIRT5, thereby ameliorating DCM-associated myocardial injury. However, SIRT5 deletion resulted in a significant reversal of the protective effect of SPI1. These observations suggest that SPI1 activates SIRT5 transcriptionally to mediate GSTP1 Mal-Lys modification and protein stability, thus ameliorating DCM-associated myocardial injury.",

Rat chondrocytes and destabilized medial meniscus (DMM) rat OA model were used as in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, lentivirus and plasmid were used to overexpress SIRT3, while siRNA was applied to establish SIRT3 knockdown. IL-1β induced inflammation, apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chondrocyte degeneration were inhibited by SIRT3 overexpression, which were enhanced in SIRT3-knockdown rat chondrocytes. Furthermore, overexpression of SIRT3 could restore IL-1β-induced autophagy inhibition. We also found that IL-1β-induced PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway activation was inhibited by SIRT3 overexpression, which was enhanced by SIRT3 knockdown. Last, intra-articular SIRT3 overexpression alleviated the severity of OA-induced rat joint damage. Our results demonstrated that SIRT3 is an important protective agent against OA pathophysiology via inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling.",

      "abstract": "Kidney diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetic nephropathy, and acute kidney injury (AKI), represent a significant global health burden. The kidneys are metabolically very active organs demanding a large amount of ATP. They are composed of highly specialized cell types in the glomerulus and subsequent tubular compartments which fine-tune metabolism to meet their numerous and diverse functions. Defective renal cell metabolism, including altered fatty acid oxidation or glycolysis, has been linked to both AKI and CKD. Mitochondria play a vital role in renal metabolism, and emerging research has identified mitochondrial sirtuins (SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5) as key regulators of renal cell metabolic adaptation, especially SIRT3. Sirtuins belong to an evolutionarily conserved family of mainly NAD",

Recent in vivo and in vitro studies have successfully demonstrated the involvement of SIRTs in key pathways for cell biological function in physiological and pathological processes of the cardiovascular system, including processes including cellular senescence, oxidative stress, apoptosis, DNA damage, and cellular metabolism. Emerging evidence has stimulated a significant evolution in preventing and treating cardiovascular disease (CVD). Here, we review the important roles of SIRTs for the regulatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and their molecular targets, including novel protein post-translational modifications of succinylation. In addition, we summarize the agonists and inhibitors currently identified to target novel specific small molecules of SIRTs. A better understanding of the role of SIRTs in the biology of CVD opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention with great potential for preventing and treating CVD.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the main risk factor for which is age, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and imposes a substantial burden on affected individuals and the economy. While the aetiology of PD is still largely unclear, substantial evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction, aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn), oxidative stress, inflammation, and autophagy play major roles in the pathogenesis of PD. Sirtuins are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, includeing seven members, i.e., SIRT1-SIRT7. Among these sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 are located in mitochondria and are called mitochondrial sirtuins. Mitochondrial sirtuins regulate the activity and biological function of mitochondrial proteins through posttranslational modification of substrate proteins. Increasing evidence shows that mitochondrial sirtuins play an important role in degenerative diseases, including PD. Mitochondrial sirtuins exert a beneficial neuroprotective effect in various models of PD. This paper summarizes a large number of studies and discusses the latest research progress on the role of mitochondrial sirtuins in PD, focusing especially on the regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC), oxidative stress, the inflammatory response and autophagy, to provide new insight into the pathogenesis of PD and new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.",

The activities of sirtuins can be altered by using small molecules that would be developed into drugs and it is proven that the manipulation of SIRT1 activity influences neurodegenerative disease models. They are interesting since using small molecules, which would be developed into a drug, it is feasible to alter the activities of sirtuins.

Additionally, we observed that the knockdown of Sirt4 in chondrocytes promoted cellular senescence and cartilage degradation, while the overexpression of Sirt4 protected the cells against TBHP-mediated senescence of chondrocytes and cartilage degradation. Moreover, our findings revealed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), abnormal mitochondrial morphology, compromised mitochondrial membrane potential, and reduced ATP production in Sirt4 knockdown chondrocytes, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, Sirt4 overexpression successfully mitigated TBHP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Further analysis revealed that Sirt4 downregulation impaired the cellular capacity to eliminate damaged mitochondria by inhibiting Pink1 in chondrocytes, thereby enhancing the accumulation of ROS and facilitating chondrocyte senescence. Notably, the overexpression of Pink1 counteracted the effects of Sirt4 knockdown on mitochondrial dysfunction. Importantly, our study demonstrated the promise of gene therapy employing a lentiviral vector encoding mouse Sirt4, as it successfully preserved the integrity of articular cartilage in mouse models of OA. In conclusion, our findings provide compelling evidence that the overexpression of Sirt4 enhances mitophagy, restores mitochondrial function, and protects against chondrocyte senescence, thereby offering a novel therapeutic target and potential strategy for the treatment of OA.",

Obviously, highly reactive metabolic intermediates, like thioesters and mixed anhydrides between phosphoric acid and organic acids, modify lysine residues spontaneously. Additionally, enzymes using acyl-CoAs as co-substrates transfer the acyl residue specifically to defined sequences within proteins. The counteracting enzymes are called histone deacetylases (HDACs), releasing the free lysine side chain. Such enzymatic activities are involved in different cellular processes like tumor progression, immune response, regulation of metabolism, and aging. Modulators of such enzymatic activities represent valuable tools in drug discovery. Therefore, direct and continuous assays to monitor enzymatic activity of HDACs are needed.

Among the SIRTs, SIRT1 is the most well-studied, with a role in the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses following infection. The functions of SIRT1 include orchestrating immune, inflammatory, metabolic, and autophagic responses, all of which are required in establishing and controlling host defenses during infection. In this review, we summarize recent information on the roles of SIRT1 and its regulatory mechanisms during bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. We also discuss several SIRT1 modulators, as potential antimicrobial treatments.

      "abstract": "Sirtuins and autophagy are well-characterized agents that can promote longevity and protect individual organisms from age-associated diseases like neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, more and more data has been obtained that discerned potential overlaps and crosstalk between Sirtuin proteins and autophagic activity. This review aims to summarize the advances within the field for each individual Sirtuin in mammalian systems. In brief, most Sirtuins have been implicated in promoting autophagy, with Sirtuin 1 and Sirtuin 6 showing the highest immediate involvement, while Sirtuin 4 and Sirtuin 5 only demonstrate occasional influence. The way Sirtuins regulate autophagy, however, is very diverse, as they have been shown to regulate gene expression of autophagy-associated genes and posttranslational modifications of proteins, with consequences for the activity and cellular localization of these proteins. They have also been shown to determine specific proteins for autophagic degradation. Overall, much data has been accumulated over recent years, yet many open questions remain. Especially although the dynamic between Sirtuin proteins and the immediate regulation of autophagic players like Light Chain 3B has been confirmed, many of these proteins have various orthologues in mammalian systems, and research so far has not exceeded the bona fide components of autophagy.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease with a genetic basis. It is characterised by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, parakeratosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. Psoriasis negatively affects a patient's physical and emotional quality of life. Sirtuins (SIRTs; silent information regulators) are an evolutionarily conserved group of enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of proteins, including deacetylation, polyADP-ribosylation, demalonylation and lipoamidation. SIRTs are involved in a number of cellular pathways related to ageing, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, tumorigenesis, the cell cycle, DNA repair and cell proliferation, positioning them as an essential component in the pathogenesis of many diseases, including psoriasis. Activation of SIRT1 counteracts oxidative-stress-induced damage by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways and may mitigate pathological events in psoriasis. There is a significant reduction in the expression of SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 and an increase in the expression of SIRT6 and SIRT7 in psoriasis. The aim of the review is to draw the attention of physicians and scientists to the importance of SIRTs in dermatology and to provide a basis and impetus for future discussions, research and pharmacological discoveries to modulate SIRT activity. In light of the analysis of the mode of action of SIRTs in psoriasis, SIRT1-SIRT5 agonists and SIRT6 and SIRT7 inhibitors may represent new therapeutic options for the treatment of psoriasis.",

Hormesis is intricately related to bioenergetic state of a cell, and therefore, nutrition impacts it. Excessive nutrition can halt the endogenous antioxidant synthesis leading to cytotoxic effects. While low and optimum doses of the same bring about hormetic stimulation that can exalt the antioxidant response and reduce susceptibility towards degenerative diseases. The sirtuin family of proteins is triggered by mild stress of calorie restriction and exerts hormesis. Similarly, several phytochemicals and micronutrients are known to bring about health benefits at optimum dose and deleterious effects at high doses. Despite this attribute, nutritional hormesis is not very well researched upon because the magnitude of hormetic effect observed is generally quite modest. There is no precise regulation of optimal intake of certain foods to witness hormesis and no characterization of any biomarker that reports stress responses at various doses above or below optimal intakes. There is a major gap in research between nutrition and hormesis being affected by sirtuin family of proteins, phytochemicals, and micronutrients.",

      "abstract": "Sirtuins (SIRTs) represent a class of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent protein deacetylases that exert a crucial role in cellular signal transduction and various biological processes. The mammalian sirtuins family encompasses SIRT1 to SIRT7, exhibiting therapeutic potential in counteracting cellular aging, modulating metabolism, responding to oxidative stress, inhibiting tumors, and improving cellular microenvironment. These enzymes are intricately linked to the occurrence and treatment of diverse pathological conditions, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. Given the significance of histone modification in gene expression and chromatin structure, maintaining the equilibrium of the sirtuins family is imperative for disease prevention and health restoration. Mounting evidence suggests that modulators of SIRTs play a crucial role in treating various diseases and maintaining physiological balance. This review delves into the molecular structure and regulatory functions of the sirtuins family, reviews the classification and historical evolution of SIRTs modulators, offers a systematic overview of existing SIRTs modulation strategies, and elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of SIRTs modulators (agonists and inhibitors) and their clinical applications. The article concludes by summarizing the challenges encountered in SIRTs modulator research and offering insights into future research directions.",

      "title": "Sirtuins' control of autophagy and mitophagy in cancer.",
      "abstract": "Mammalian cells use a specialized and complex machinery for the removal of altered proteins or dysfunctional organelles. Such machinery is part of a mechanism called autophagy. Moreover, when autophagy is specifically employed for the removal of dysfunctional mitochondria, it is called mitophagy. Autophagy and mitophagy have important physiological implications and roles associated with cellular differentiation, resistance to stresses such as starvation, metabolic control and adaptation to the changing microenvironment. Unfortunately, transformed cancer cells often exploit autophagy and mitophagy for sustaining their metabolic reprogramming and growth to a point that autophagy and mitophagy are recognized as promising targets for ongoing and future antitumoral therapies. Sirtuins are NAD+ dependent deacylases with a fundamental role in sensing and modulating cellular response to external stresses such as nutrients availability and therefore involved in aging, oxidative stress control, inflammation, differentiation and cancer. It is clear, therefore, that autophagy, mitophagy and sirtuins share many common aspects to a point that, recently, sirtuins have been linked to the control of autophagy and mitophagy. In the context of cancer, such a control is obtained by modulating transcription of autophagy and mitophagy genes, by post translational modification of proteins belonging to the autophagy and mitophagy machinery, by controlling ROS production or major metabolic pathways such as Krebs cycle or glutamine metabolism. The present review details current knowledge on the role of sirtuins, autophagy and mitophagy in cancer to then proceed to discuss how sirtuins can control autophagy and mitophagy in cancer cells. Finally, we discuss sirtuins role in the context of tumor progression and metastasis indicating glutamine metabolism as an example of how a concerted activation and/or inhibition of sirtuins in cancer cells can control autophagy and mitophagy by impinging on the metabolism of this fundamental amino acid.",

      "abstract": "Although post-translational modification is critical to tumorigenesis, how succinylation modification of lysine sites influences hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains obscure. 90 tumours and paired adjacent normal tissue of liver cancer were enrolled for succinylation staining. 423 HCC samples with 20 genes related to succinylation modification from TCGA were downloaded for model construction. Statistical methods were employed to analyse the data, including the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm, t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, and Cox regression analysis. The staining pan-succinyllysine antibody staining indicated that tumour tissues had a higher succinyllysine level than adjacent tissues (p &lt; 0.001), which could be associated with a worse prognosis (p = 0.02). The survival was associated with pathological stage, tumour recurrence status and succinyllysine intensity in the univariate or multivariable cox survival analysis model. The risk model from 20 succinyllysine-related genes had the best prognosis prediction. The high expression of succinylation modification in HCC contributed to the worse patient survival prognosis. Model construction of 20 genes related to succinylation modification (MEAF6, OXCT1, SIRT2, CREBBP, KAT5, SIRT4, SIRT6, SIRT7, CPT1A, GLYATL1, SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT5, SUCLA2, SUCLG1 and SUCLG2) could be reliable in predicting prognosis in HCC.",

      "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have a variety of cardiovascular and renoprotective effects and have been developed as novel agents for the treatment of heart failure. However, the beneficial mechanisms of SGLT2i on cardiac tissue need to be investigated further. In this study, we established a mouse model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using coronary artery constriction surgery and investigated the role of dapagliflozin (DAPA) in protecting cardiomyocytes from hypoxic injury induced by AMI. In vitro experiments were done using hypoxic cultured H9c2 ventricular cells to verify this potential mechanism. Expression of the SIRT family and related genes and proteins was verified by qPCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining, and the intrinsic potential mechanism of cardiomyocyte death due to AMI and hypoxia was comprehensively investigated by RNA sequencing. The RNA sequencing results of cardiomyocytes from AMI mice showed that the SIRT family may be mainly involved in the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte death. In vitro hypoxia-induced ventricular cells showed the role of dapagliflozin in conferring resistance to hypoxic injury in cardiomyocytes. It showed that SIRT1/3/6 were downregulated in H9c2 cells in a hypoxic environment, and the addition of dapagliflozin significantly increased the gene and protein expression of SIRT1, 3 and 6. We then verified the underlying mechanisms induced by dapagliflozin in hypoxic cardiomyocytes using RNA-seq, and found that dapagliflozin upregulated the hypoxia-induced gene downregulation, which includes ",

Here, rats were fed ad libitum (AL) or on an alternate-day food deprivation intermittent fasting (IF) diet for 3 months, followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery. The body weight, infarct volume, and neurological deficit score were accessed at the designated time points. ELISA, qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to determine cytokine secretion and the expression of SIRT6, TXNIP, and signaling molecules, respectively. Immunofluorescence evaluated microglial activation and angiogenesis in vivo. For in vitro study, oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-treated cell model was generated. MTT and tube formation assays were employed to determine cell viability and tube formation capability. ChIP assay detected chromatin occupancy of SIRT6 and SIRT6-mediated H3 deacetylation. We found that IF or ER mimetics ameliorated cerebral ischemic brain damage and microglial activation, and potentiated angiogenesis in vivo. ER mimetics or SIRT6 overexpression alleviated cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)-induced injury in vitro. SIRT6 suppressed TXNIP via deacetylation of H3K9ac and H3K56ac in HAPI cells and BMVECs. Downregulation of SIRT6 reversed ER mimetics-mediated protection during cerebral I/R in vitro. Our study demonstrated that ER-mediated upregulation of SIRT6 inhibited microglia activation and potentiated angiogenesis in cerebral ischemia via suppressing TXNIP.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres are specialized nucleoprotein structures at the ends of linear chromosomes that prevent the activation of DNA damage response and repair pathways. Numerous factors localize at telomeres to regulate their length, structure and function, to avert replicative senescence or genome instability and cell death. In humans, Mendelian defects in several of these factors can result in abnormally short or dysfunctional telomeres, causing a group of rare heterogeneous premature-ageing diseases, termed telomeropathies, short-telomere syndromes or telomere biology disorders (TBDs). Here, we review the TBD-causing genes identified so far and describe their main functions associated with telomere biology. We present molecular aspects of TBDs, including genetic anticipation, phenocopy, incomplete penetrance and somatic genetic rescue, which underlie the complexity of these diseases. We also discuss the implications of phenotypic and genetic features of TBDs on fundamental aspects related to human telomere biology, ageing and cancer, as well as on diagnostic, therapeutic and clinical approaches.",

      "abstract": "The role of telomeres in human health and disease is yet to be fully understood. The limitations of mouse models for the study of human telomere biology and difficulties in accurately measuring the length of telomere repeats in chromosomes and cells have diverted attention from many important and relevant observations. The goal of this perspective is to summarize some of these observations and to discuss the antagonistic role of telomere loss in aging and cancer in the context of developmental biology, cell turnover, and evolution. It is proposed that both damage to DNA and replicative loss of telomeric DNA contribute to aging in humans, with the differences in leukocyte telomere length between humans being linked to the risk of developing specific diseases. These ideas are captured in the Telomere Erosion in Disposable Soma theory of aging proposed herein.",

      "abstract": "Cancer cells establish replicative immortality by activating a telomere-maintenance mechanism (TMM), be it telomerase or the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. Targeting telomere maintenance represents an intriguing opportunity to treat the vast majority of all cancer types. Whilst telomerase inhibitors have historically been heralded as promising anticancer agents, the reality has been more challenging, and there are currently no therapeutic options for cancer types that use ALT despite their aggressive nature and poor prognosis. In this Review, we discuss the mechanistic differences between telomere maintenance by telomerase and ALT, the current methods used to detect each mechanism, the utility of these tests for clinical diagnosis, and recent developments in the therapeutic strategies being employed to target both telomerase and ALT. We present notable developments in repurposing established therapeutic agents and new avenues that are emerging to target cancer types according to which TMM they employ. These opportunities extend beyond inhibition of telomere maintenance, by finding and exploiting inherent weaknesses in the telomeres themselves to trigger rapid cellular effects that lead to cell death.",

Studies of a specialized DNA strand break repair mechanism, known as break-induced replication, and the advent of telomere-specific DNA damaging strategies and proteomic methodologies to profile the ribonucleoprotein composition of telomeres enabled the discovery of networks of proteins that coordinate the stepwise homology-directed DNA repair and DNA synthesis processes of ALT. These networks couple mediators of homologous recombination, DNA template-switching, long-range template-directed DNA synthesis, and DNA strand resolution with SUMO-dependent liquid condensate formation to create discrete nuclear bodies where telomere extension occurs. This review will discuss the recent findings of how these networks may cooperate to mediate telomere extension by the ALT mechanism and their impact on telomere function and integrity in ALT cancer cells.",

      "abstract": "Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) is a type of long non-coding RNA transcribed from telomeres, and it forms R-loops by invasion into telomeric DNA. Since either an excessive or inadequate number of R-loops leads to telomere instability, the TERRA levels need to be delicately modulated. In this study, we found that m6A modification presents on the subtelomeric regions of TERRA and stabilizes it, and the loss of METTL3 impacts telomere stability. Mechanically, the m6A modification on TERRA is catalyzed by METTL3, recognized and stabilized by the m6A reader YTHDC1. Knockdown of either METTL3 or YTHDC1 enhances TERRA degradation. The m6A-modified TERRA forms R-loops and promotes homologous recombination which is essential for the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway in cancer cells. METTL3 depletion leads to R-loop reduction, telomere shortening and instability. Altogether, these findings reveal that METTL3 protects telomeres by catalyzing m6A modification on TERRA, indicating that inhibition or deletion of METTL3 is potentially a new avenue for ALT cancer therapy.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres protect the ends of chromosomes but shorten following cell division in the absence of telomerase activity. When telomeres become critically short or damaged, a DNA damage response is activated. Telomeres then become dysfunctional and trigger cellular senescence or death. Telomere shortening occurs with ageing and may contribute to associated maladies such as infertility, neurodegeneration, cancer, lung dysfunction and haematopoiesis disorders. Telomere dysfunction (sometimes without shortening) is associated with various diseases, known as telomere biology disorders (also known as telomeropathies). Telomere biology disorders include dyskeratosis congenita, Høyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, Coats plus syndrome and Revesz syndrome. Although mouse models have been invaluable in advancing telomere research, full recapitulation of human telomere-related diseases in mice has been challenging, owing to key differences between the species. In this Review, we discuss telomere protection, maintenance and damage. We highlight the differences between human and mouse telomere biology that may contribute to discrepancies between human diseases and mouse models. Finally, we discuss recent efforts to generate new 'humanized' mouse models to better model human telomere biology. A better understanding of the limitations of mouse telomere models will pave the road for more human-like models and further our understanding of telomere biology disorders, which will contribute towards the development of new therapies.",

In mammals, telomerase recruitment to telomeres is mediated by TPP1, which assembles as a heterodimer with POT1. We report structures of DNA-bound telomerase in complex with TPP1 and with TPP1-POT1 at 3.2- and 3.9-angstrom resolution, respectively. Our structures define interactions between telomerase and TPP1-POT1 that are crucial for telomerase recruitment to telomeres. The presence of TPP1-POT1 stabilizes the DNA, revealing an unexpected path by which DNA exits the telomerase active site and a DNA anchor site on telomerase that is important for telomerase processivity. Our findings rationalize extensive prior genetic and biochemical findings and provide a framework for future mechanistic work on telomerase regulation.",

RAD52 promotes ALT by facilitating D-loop formation, but ALT also occurs through a RAD52-independent BIR pathway. Here, we show that the telomere non-coding RNA TERRA forms dynamic telomeric R-loops and contributes to ALT activity in RAD52 knockout cells. TERRA forms R-loops in vitro and at telomeres in a RAD51AP1-dependent manner. The formation of R-loops by TERRA increases G-quadruplexes (G4s) at telomeres. G4 stabilization enhances ALT even when TERRA is depleted, suggesting that G4s act downstream of R-loops to promote BIR. In vitro, the telomeric R-loops assembled by TERRA and RAD51AP1 generate G4s, which persist after R-loop resolution and allow formation of telomeric D-loops without RAD52. Thus, the dynamic telomeric R-loops formed by TERRA and RAD51AP1 enable the RAD52-independent ALT pathway, and G4s orchestrate an R- to D-loop switch at telomeres to stimulate BIR.",

      "abstract": "The ageing process involves a gradual decline of chromosome integrity throughout an organism's lifespan. Telomeres are protective DNA-protein complexes that cap the ends of linear chromosomes in eukaryotic organisms. Telomeric DNA consists of long stretches of short \"TTAGGG\" repeats that are conserved across most eukaryotes including humans. Telomeres shorten progressively with each round of DNA replication due to the inability of conventional DNA polymerase to completely replicate the chromosome ends, known as the \"end-replication problem\". The telomerase enzyme counteracts the telomeric DNA loss by de novo addition of telomeric repeats onto chromosomal ends. Germline and stem cells maintain significant levels of telomerase activity to maintain telomere length and can divide almost indefinitely. However, the differentiation of stem cells accompanies the inactivation of telomerase gene expression, resulting in the progressive shortening of telomeres in somatic cells over successive divisions. Critically short telomeres elicit and sustain a persistent DNA damage response leading to permanent growth arrest of cells known as cellular senescence, a hallmark of cellular ageing. The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and organs contributes to organismal ageing. Thus, the prevention of telomere shortening is a promising means to delay or even reverse cellular ageing.

      "abstract": "It has been known for decades that telomerase extends the 3' end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes and dictates the telomeric repeat sequence based on the template in its RNA. However, telomerase does not mitigate sequence loss at the 5' ends of chromosomes, which results from lagging strand DNA synthesis and nucleolytic processing. Therefore, a second enzyme is needed to keep telomeres intact: DNA polymerase α/Primase bound to Ctc1-Stn1-Ten1 (CST). CST-Polα/Primase maintains telomeres through a fill-in reaction that replenishes the lost sequences at the 5' ends. CST not only serves to maintain telomeres but also determines their length by keeping telomerase from overelongating telomeres. Here we discuss recent data on the evolution, structure, function, and recruitment of mammalian CST-Polα/Primase, highlighting the role of this complex and telomere length control in human disease.",

      "abstract": "The regulation of telomere length in mammals is crucial for chromosome end-capping and thus for maintaining genome stability and cellular lifespan. This process requires coordination between telomeric protein complexes and the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, which extends the telomeric DNA. Telomeric proteins modulate telomere architecture, recruit telomerase to accessible telomeres and orchestrate the conversion of the newly synthesized telomeric single-stranded DNA tail into double-stranded DNA. Dysfunctional telomere maintenance leads to telomere shortening, which causes human diseases including bone marrow failure, premature ageing and cancer. Recent studies provide new insights into telomerase-related interactions (the 'telomere replisome') and reveal new challenges for future telomere structural biology endeavours owing to the dynamic nature of telomere architecture and the great number of structures that telomeres form. In this Review, we discuss recently determined structures of the shelterin and CTC1-STN1-TEN1 (CST) complexes, how they may participate in the regulation of telomere replication and chromosome end-capping, and how disease-causing mutations in their encoding genes may affect specific functions. Major outstanding questions in the field include how all of the telomere components assemble relative to each other and how the switching between different telomere structures is achieved.",

      "abstract": "Telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomeres at natural chromosome ends, should be repressed at double-strand breaks (DSBs), where neotelomere formation can cause terminal truncations. We developed an assay to detect neotelomere formation at Cas9- or I-SceI-induced DSBs in human cells. Telomerase added telomeric repeats to DSBs, leading to interstitial telomeric repeat insertions or the formation of functional neotelomeres accompanied by terminal deletions. The threat that telomerase poses to genome integrity was minimized by ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase signaling, which inhibited telomerase at resected DSBs. In addition to acting at resected DSBs, telomerase used the extruded strand in the Cas9 enzyme-product complex as a primer for neotelomere formation. We propose that although neotelomere formation is detrimental in normal human cells, it may allow cancer cells to escape from breakage-fusion-bridge cycles.",

Here, we report that the RNA-binding motif protein 14 (RBM14) is associated with telomeres in human cancer cells. RBM14 negatively regulates TERRA expression. It also binds to TERRA and inhibits it from forming TERRA R-loops at telomeres. RBM14 depletion has several effects, including elevated TERRA levels, telomeric R-loops, telomere dysfunction-induced DNA damage foci formation, particularly in the presence of DNA replication stress, pRPA32 accumulation at telomeres and telomere signal-free ends. Thus, RBM14 protects telomere integrity via modulating TERRA levels and its R-loop formation at telomeres.",

      "abstract": "Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism activated in ~10-15% of cancers, characterized by telomeric damage. Telomeric damage-induced long non-coding RNAs (dilncRNAs) are transcribed at dysfunctional telomeres and contribute to telomeric DNA damage response (DDR) activation and repair. Here we observed that telomeric dilncRNAs are preferentially elevated in ALT cells. Inhibition of C-rich (teloC) dilncRNAs with antisense oligonucleotides leads to DNA replication stress responses, increased genomic instability, and apoptosis induction selectively in ALT cells. Cell death is dependent on DNA replication and is increased by DNA replication stress. Mechanistically, teloC dilncRNA inhibition reduces RAD51 and 53BP1 recruitment to telomeres, boosts the engagement of BIR machinery, and increases C-circles and telomeric sister chromatid exchanges, without increasing telomeric non-S phase synthesis. These results indicate that teloC dilncRNA is necessary for a coordinated recruitment of DDR factors to ALT telomeres and it is essential for ALT cancer cells survival.",

      "abstract": "Telomere biology was first studied in maize, ciliates, yeast, and mice, and in recent decades, it has informed understanding of common disease mechanisms with broad implications for patient care. Short telomere syndromes are the most prevalent premature aging disorders, with prominent phenotypes affecting the lung and hematopoietic system. Less understood are a newly recognized group of cancer-prone syndromes that are associated with mutations that lengthen telomeres. A large body of new data from Mendelian genetics and epidemiology now provides an opportunity to reconsider paradigms related to the role of telomeres in human aging and cancer, and in some cases, the findings diverge from what was interpreted from model systems. For example, short telomeres have been considered potent drivers of genome instability, but age-associated solid tumors are rare in individuals with short telomere syndromes, and T cell immunodeficiency explains their spectrum. More commonly, short telomeres promote clonal hematopoiesis, including somatic reversion, providing a new leukemogenesis paradigm that is independent of genome instability. Long telomeres, on the other hand, which extend the cellular life span in vitro, are now appreciated to be the most common shared germline risk factor for cancer in population studies. Through this contemporary lens, I revisit here the role of telomeres in human aging, focusing on how short and long telomeres drive cancer evolution but through distinct mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Three-stranded DNA: RNA hybrids known as R-loops form when the non-template DNA strand is displaced and the mRNA transcript anneals to its template strand. Although R-loop formation controls DNA damage response, mitochondrial and genomic transcription, and physiological R-loop formation, imbalanced formation of R-loop can jeopardize a cell's genomic integrity. Transcription regulation and immunoglobulin class switch recombination are two further specialized functions of genomic R-loops. R-loop formation has a dual role in the development of cancer and disturbed R-loop homeostasis as observed in several malignancies. R-loops transcribe at the telomeric and pericentromeric regions, develop in the space between long non-coding RNAs and telomeric repeats, and shield telomeres. In bacteria and archaea, R-loop development is a natural defence mechanism against viruses which also causes DNA degradation. Their emergence in the mammalian genome is controlled, suggesting that they were formed as an inevitable byproduct of RNA transcription but also co-opted for regulatory functions. R-loops may be engaged in cell physiology by regulating gene expression. R-loop biology is probably going to remain a fascinating field of study for a very long time as it offers many avenues for R-loop research.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres are specialized genetic structures present at the end of all eukaryotic linear chromosomes. They progressively get shortened after each cell division due to end replication problems. Telomere shortening (TS) and chromosomal instability cause apoptosis and massive cell death. Following oncogene activation and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes, cells acquire mechanisms such as telomerase expression and alternative lengthening of telomeres to maintain telomere length (TL) and prevent initiation of cellular senescence or apoptosis. Significant TS, telomerase activation and alteration in expression of telomere-associated proteins are frequent features of different haematological malignancies that reflect on the progression, response to therapy and recurrence of these diseases. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that has a pivotal role in maintaining the TL. However, telomerase activity in most somatic cells is insufficient to prevent TS. In 85-90% of tumour cells, the critically short telomeric length is maintained by telomerase activation. Thus, overexpression of telomerase in most tumour cells is a potential target for cancer therapy. In this review, alteration of telomeres, telomerase and telomere-associated proteins in different haematological malignancies and related telomerase-based therapies are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures that play a pivotal role in the protection and maintenance of eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, which replenishes telomeric DNA lost during replication, are important factors necessary to ensure continued cell proliferation. Cell proliferation is also dependent on proper and efficient protein synthesis, which is carried out by ribosomes. Mutations in genes involved in either ribosome biogenesis or telomere biology result in cellular abnormalities and can cause human genetic diseases, defined as ribosomopathies and telomeropathies, respectively. Interestingly, recent discoveries indicate that many of the ribosome assembly and rRNA maturation factors have additional noncanonical functions in telomere biology. Similarly, several key proteins and enzymes involved in telomere biology, including telomerase, have unexpected roles in rRNA transcription and maturation. These observations point to an intriguing cross-talk mechanism potentially explaining the multiple pleiotropic symptoms of mutations in many causal genes identified in various telomeropathy and ribosomopathy diseases. In this review, we provide a brief summary of eukaryotic telomere and rDNA loci structures, highlight several universal features of rRNA and telomerase biogenesis, evaluate intriguing interconnections between telomere biology and ribosome assembly, and conclude with an assessment of overlapping features of human diseases of telomeropathies and ribosomopathies.",

      "abstract": "Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) utilizes a recombination mechanism and break-induced DNA synthesis to maintain telomere length without telomerase, but it is unclear how cells initiate ALT. TERRA, telomeric repeat-containing RNA, forms RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) at ALT telomeres. We show that depleting TERRA using an RNA-targeting Cas9 system reduces ALT-associated PML bodies, telomere clustering, and telomere lengthening. TERRA interactome reveals that TERRA interacts with an extensive subset of DNA repair proteins in ALT cells. One of TERRA interacting proteins, the endonuclease XPF, is highly enriched at ALT telomeres and recruited by telomeric R-loops to induce DNA damage response (DDR) independent of CSB and SLX4, and thus triggers break-induced telomere synthesis and lengthening. The attraction of BRCA1 and RAD51 at telomeres requires XPF in FANCM-deficient cells that accumulate telomeric R-loops. Our results suggest that telomeric R-loops activate DDR via XPF to promote homologous recombination and telomere replication to drive ALT.",

      "title": "Telomere-specific regulation of TERRA and its impact on telomere stability.",
      "abstract": "TERRA is a class of telomeric repeat-containing RNAs that are expressed from telomeres in multiple organisms. TERRA transcripts play key roles in telomere maintenance and their physiological levels are essential to maintain the integrity of telomeric DNA. Indeed, deregulated TERRA expression or its altered localization can impact telomere stability by multiple mechanisms including fueling transcription-replication conflicts, promoting resection of chromosome ends, altering the telomeric chromatin, and supporting homologous recombination. Therefore, a fine-tuned control of TERRA is important to maintain the integrity of the genome. Several studies have reported that different cell lines express substantially different levels of TERRA. Most importantly, TERRA levels markedly vary among telomeres of a given cell type, indicating the existence of telomere-specific regulatory mechanisms which may help coordinate TERRA functions. TERRA molecules contain distinct subtelomeric sequences, depending on their telomere of origin, which may instruct specific post-transcriptional modifications or mediate distinct functions. In addition, all TERRA transcripts share a repetitive G-rich sequence at their 3' end which can form DNA:RNA hybrids and fold into G-quadruplex structures. Both structures are involved in TERRA functions and can critically affect telomere stability. In this review, we examine the mechanisms controlling TERRA levels and the impact of their telomere-specific regulation on telomere stability. We compare evidence obtained in different model organisms, discussing recent advances as well as controversies in the field. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of DNA:RNA hybrids and G-quadruplex structures in the context of TERRA biology and telomere maintenance.",

Firstly, we summarize the structure and function of telomeres and their role in cell division. Subsequently, we discuss the mechanisms through which telomere regulation contributes to aging processes while analyzing its involvement in skin aging by elaborating on biological markers. Furthermore, this paper presents a summary of recent research progress that reveals the correlation between telomere length and skin aging as well as model building methods; it also proposes telomere length as a potential indicator for predicting skin aging. Finally, anti-aging strategies based on telomere protection are discussed including drug therapy and lifestyle adjustments.

      "abstract": "Telomeres and telomerase play a crucial role in human aging and cancer. Three \"drivers\" of human aging can be identified. The developmental program encoded in DNA is the primary determinant of lifespan. Faithful execution of the developmental program requires stability of the (epi-)genome which is challenged throughout life by damage to DNA as well as epigenetic 'scars' from error-free DNA repair and stochastic errors made during the establishment and maintenance of the \"epigenome\". Over time (epi-)mutations accumulate, compromising cellular function and causing (pre-)malignant alterations. Damage to the genome and epigenome can be considered the second \"driver\" of aging. A third driver of the aging process, important to suppress tumors in long-lived animals, is caused by progressive loss of telomeric DNA. Telomere erosion protects against cancer early in life but limits cell renewal late in life, in agreement with the Antagonistic Pleiotropy theory on the evolutionary origin of aging. Malignant tumors arise when mutations and/or epimutations in cells (clock 2) corrupt the developmental program (clock 1) as well as tumor suppression by telomere erosion (clock 3). In cancer cells clock 3 is typically inactivated by loss of p53 as well as increased expression of telomerase. Taken together, aging in humans can be described by the ticking of three clocks: the clock that directs development, the accumulation of (epi-)mutations over time and the telomere clock that limits the number of cell divisions in normal stem and immune cells.",

      "abstract": "TERF2/TRF2 is a pleiotropic telomeric protein that plays a crucial role in tumor formation and progression through several telomere-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we uncovered a novel function for this protein in regulating the macroautophagic/autophagic process upon different stimuli. By using both biochemical and cell biology approaches, we found that TERF2 binds to the non-histone chromatin-associated protein HMGB1, and this interaction is functional to the nuclear/cytoplasmic protein localization. Specifically, silencing of TERF2 alters the redox status of the cells, further exacerbated upon EBSS nutrient starvation, promoting the cytosolic translocation and the autophagic activity of HMGB1. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type TERF2, but not the mutant unable to bind HMGB1, negatively affects the cytosolic translocation of HMGB1, counteracting the stimulatory effect of EBSS starvation. Moreover, genetic depletion of HMGB1 or treatment with inflachromene, a specific inhibitor of its cytosolic translocation, completely abolished the pro-autophagic activity of TERF2 silencing. In conclusion, our data highlighted a novel mechanism through which TERF2 modulates the autophagic process, thus demonstrating the key role of the telomeric protein in regulating a process that is fundamental, under both physiological and pathological conditions, in defining the fate of the cells.",

      "abstract": "The ends of chromosomes shorten at each round of cell division, and this process is thought to be affected by occupational exposures. Occupational hazards may alter telomere length homeostasis resulting in DNA damage, chromosome aberration, mutations, epigenetic alterations and inflammation. Therefore, for the protection of genetic material, nature has provided a unique nucleoprotein structure known as a telomere. Telomeres provide protection by averting an inappropriate activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) at chromosomal ends and preventing recognition of single and double strand DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA) breaks or chromosomal end-to-end fusion. Telomeres and their interacting six shelterin complex proteins in coordination act as inhibitors of DNA damage machinery by blocking DDR activation at chromosomes, thereby preventing the occurrence of genome instability, perturbed cell cycle, cellular senescence and apoptosis. However, inappropriate DNA repair may result in the inadequate distribution of genetic material during cell division, resulting in the eventual development of tumorigenesis and other pathologies. This article reviews the current literature on the association of changes in telomere length and its interacting proteins with different occupational exposures and the potential application of telomere length or changes in the regulatory proteins as potential biomarkers for exposure and health response, including recent findings and future perspectives.",

Short-term Trf1 deletion in renal fibroblasts was not sufficient to trigger kidney fibrosis but was sufficient to induce inflammatory responses, ECM deposition, cell cycle arrest, fibrogenesis, and vascular rarefaction. However, long-term persistent deletion of Trf1 in fibroblasts resulted in kidney fibrosis accompanied by an elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) and a decrease in mouse survival. These cellular responses lead to the macrophage-to-myofibroblast transition (MMT), endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ultimately causing kidney fibrosis at the humane endpoint (HEP) when the deletion of Trf1 in fibroblasts is maintained throughout the lifespan of mice. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of dysfunctional telomeres in the onset of the profibrotic alterations that lead to kidney fibrosis.",

      "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a primary cause of cellular senescence and contributes to the etiology of numerous human diseases. Oxidative damage to telomeric DNA has been proposed to cause premature senescence by accelerating telomere shortening. Here, we tested this model directly using a precision chemoptogenetic tool to produce the common lesion 8-oxo-guanine (8oxoG) exclusively at telomeres in human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. A single induction of telomeric 8oxoG is sufficient to trigger multiple hallmarks of p53-dependent senescence. Telomeric 8oxoG activates ATM and ATR signaling, and enriches for markers of telomere dysfunction in replicating, but not quiescent cells. Acute 8oxoG production fails to shorten telomeres, but rather generates fragile sites and mitotic DNA synthesis at telomeres, indicative of impaired replication. Based on our results, we propose that oxidative stress promotes rapid senescence by producing oxidative base lesions that drive replication-dependent telomere fragility and dysfunction in the absence of shortening and shelterin loss.",

In humans, they consist of TTAGGG repeats, which are bound by dedicated proteins such as the shelterin complex. This complex blocks unwanted DNA damage repair at telomeres, e.g. by suppressing nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) through its subunit TRF2. Here, we describe ZNF524, a zinc finger protein that directly binds telomeric repeats with nanomolar affinity, and reveal base-specific sequence recognition by cocrystallization with telomeric DNA. ZNF524 localizes to telomeres and specifically maintains the presence of the TRF2/RAP1 subcomplex at telomeres without affecting other shelterin members. Loss of ZNF524 concomitantly results in an increase in DNA damage signaling and recombination events. Overall, ZNF524 is a direct telomere-binding protein involved in the maintenance of telomere integrity.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres consist of repetitive tracts of DNA that shield a chromosome's contents from erosion and replicative attrition. However, telomeres are also late-replicating regions of the genome in which a myriad of replicative obstructions reside. The obstacles contained within telomeres, as well as their genomic location, drive replicative stalling and subsequent fork collapse in these regions. Consequently, large scale deletions, under-replicated DNA, translocations, and fusion events arise following telomere replication failure. Further, under-replicated DNA and telomere fusions that are permitted to enter mitosis will produce mitotic DNA bridges - known drivers of genetic loss and chromothripsis. Thus, aberrant telomere replication promotes genomic instability, which, in turn leads either to cellular death, senescence or oncogenic transformation. The importance of these issues for organismal well-being necessitates a need for resolute telomere maintenance. Here, we describe recent advances in identifying and understanding the molecular mechanisms that are in place in human cells to escort the replisome through the telomere's unwieldy structures and repetitive sequences. Finally, we review the pathways that combat the deleterious outcomes that occur when telomeric replication forks do collapse.",

Furthermore, the recently identified novel mechanistic actions for telomere maintenance offer a fresh viewpoint and approach to the management of telomeres and associated disorders.

      "abstract": "Abolition of telomerase activity results in telomere shortening, a process that eventually destabilizes the ends of chromosomes, leading to genomic instability and cell growth arrest or death. Telomere shortening leads to the attainment of the \"Hayflick limit\", and the transition of cells to state of senescence. If senescence is bypassed, cells undergo crisis through loss of checkpoints. This process causes massive cell death concomitant with further telomere shortening and spontaneous telomere fusions. In functional telomere of mammalian cells, DNA contains double-stranded tandem repeats of TTAGGG. The Shelterin complex, which is composed of six different proteins, is required for the regulation of telomere length and stability in cells. Telomere protection by telomeric repeat binding protein 2 (TRF2) is dependent on DNA damage response (DDR) inhibition via formation of T-loop structures. Many protein kinases contribute to the DDR activated cell cycle checkpoint pathways, and prevent DNA replication until damaged DNA is repaired. Thereby, the connection between cell fate and telomere length-associated telomerase activity is regulated by multiple protein kinase activities. Contrarily, inactivation of DNA damage checkpoint protein kinases in senescent cells can restore cell-cycle progression into S phase. Therefore, telomere-initiated senescence is a DNA damage checkpoint response that is activated with a direct contribution from dysfunctional telomeres. In this review, in addition to the above mentioned, the choice of main repair pathways, which comprise non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination in telomere uncapping telomere dysfunctions, are discussed.",

At the nucleotide level, telomeres typically represent stretches of tandemly arranged telomeric repeats, which vary in length and sequence among different groups of organisms. Recently, a composition of the telomere-associated protein complex has been scrutinized in Trypanosoma brucei. In this work, we subjected proteins from that list to a more detailed bioinformatic analysis and delineated a core set of 20 conserved proteins putatively associated with telomeres in trypanosomatids. Out of these, two proteins (Ku70 and Ku80) are conspicuously missing in representatives of the genus Blastocrithidia, yet telomeres in these species do not appear to be affected. In this work, based on the analysis of a large set of trypanosomatids widely different in their phylogenetic position and life strategies, we demonstrated that telomeres of trypanosomatids are diverse in length, even within groups of closely related species. Our analysis showed that the expression of two proteins predicted to be associated with telomeres (those encoding telomerase and telomere-associated hypothetical protein orthologous to Tb927.6.4330) may directly affect and account for the differences in telomere length within the species of the Leishmania mexicana complex.",

      "abstract": "Telomeric repeat containing RNA (TERRA) is a noncoding RNA that is transcribed from telomeres. Previous study showed that TERRA trans anneals by invading into the telomeric duplex to form an R-loop in mammalian cells. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying TERRA recruitment and invasion into telomeres in the context of shelterin proteins, RAD51 and RNase H using single molecule (sm) assays. We demonstrate that TERRA trans annealing into telomeric DNA exhibits dynamic movement that is stabilized by TRF2. TERRA annealing to the telomeric duplex results in the formation of a stable triplex structure which differs from a conventional R-loop. We identified that the presence of a sub-telomeric DNA and a telomeric overhang in the form of a G-quadruplex significantly enhances TERRA annealing to telomeric duplex. We also demonstrate that RAD51-TERRA complex invades telomere duplex more efficiently than TERRA alone. Additionally, TRF2 increases TERRA affinity to telomeric duplex and protects it from RNase H digestion. In contrast, TRF1 represses TERRA annealing to telomeric duplex and fails to provide protection against RNase H digestion. Our findings provide an in-depth molecular mechanism underpinning TERRA recruitment and annealing to the telomere.",

      "abstract": "Telomeres are structures made of DNA, proteins and RNA found at the ends of eukaryotic linear chromosomes. These dynamic nucleoprotein structures protect chromosomal tips from end-to-end fusions, degradation, activation of damage checkpoints and erroneous DNA repair events. Telomeres were thought to be transcriptionally silent regions because of their constitutive heterochromatin signature until telomeric long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) were discovered. One of them, TERRA (TElomeric Repeat-containing RNA), starts in the subtelomeric regions towards the chromosome ends from different telomeres and has been extensively studied in many evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. Changes in TERRA's expression can lead to telomeric dysfunction, interfere with the replicative machinery and impact telomere length. TERRA also co-localizes in vivo with telomerase, and can form RNA:DNA hybrid structures called R-loops, which have been implicated in the onset of senescence and the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway. Yet, the molecular mechanisms involving TERRA, as well as its function, remain elusive. Here, we review the current knowledge of TERRA transcription, structure, expression, regulation and its multiple telomeric and extra-telomeric functions in the budding yeast ",

      "abstract": "Erk signaling is indispensable for the self-renewal and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), as well as telomere homeostasis. But how Erk regulates these biological processes remains unclear. We identified 132 Erk2 interacting proteins by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis, and focused on Ddx39 as a potential Erk2 substrate. We demonstrated that Erk2 phosphorylates Ddx39 on Y132 and Y138. Ddx39 knockout (KO) ESCs are defective in differentiation, due to reduced H3K27ac level upon differentiation. Phosphorylation of Ddx39 promotes the recruitment of Hat1 to acetylate H3K27 and activate differentiation genes. In addition, Ddx39 KO leads to telomere elongation in ESCs. Ddx39 is recruited to telomeres by the telomere-binding protein Trf1, consequently disrupting the DNA loop formed by Trf1 and suppressing the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Phosphorylation of Ddx39 weakens its interaction with Trf1, releasing it from telomeres. Thus, ALT activity is enhanced, and telomeres are elongated. Altogether, our studies reveal an essential role of Ddx39 in the differentiation and telomere homeostasis of ESCs.",

They shelter the terminal genome territories against degradation and prevent the natural chromosome ends from being recognized by repair mechanisms as double-strand DNA breaks.There are two basic characteristics of telomeric DNA, its sequence and its length. The telomere sequence is important as a \"landing area\" for specific telomere-binding proteins, which function as signals and moderate the interactions required for correct telomere function. While the sequence forms the proper \"landing surface\" of telomeric DNA, its length is similarly important. Too short or exceptionally long telomere DNA cannot perform its function properly.

By affecting molecular pathways of senescence, polyphenols are able to prevent or delay the senescence formation and, consequently, avoid or ameliorate aging and age-associated pathologies of the skin.

Here, we summarize pathways that cause mitochondrial dysfunction in senescence and aging and discuss the major consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction and how these consequences contribute to senescence and aging.

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence entails a state of an essentially irreversible proliferative arrest in which cells remain metabolically active and secrete a range of pro-inflammatory and proteolytic factors as part of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. There are different types of senescent cells, and senescence can be induced in response to many DNA damage signals. Senescent cells accumulate in different tissues and organs where they have distinct physiological and pathological functions. Despite this diversity, all senescent cells must be able to survive in a nondividing state while protecting themselves from positive feedback loops linked to the constant activation of the DNA damage response. This capacity requires changes in core cellular programs. Understanding how different cell types can undergo extensive changes in their transcriptional programs, metabolism, heterochromatin patterns, and cellular structures to induce a common cellular state is crucial to preventing cancer development/progression and to improving health during aging. In this review, we discuss how senescent cells continuously evolve after their initial proliferative arrest and highlight the unifying features that define the senescent state.",

Similar to any other tissue, the skin is influenced not only by intrinsic/chronological aging, but also by extrinsic aging, triggered by environmental factors that contribute to accelerating the skin aging process. Aged skin shows structural, cellular, and molecular changes and accumulation of senescent cells. These senescent cells can induce or accelerate the age-related dysfunction of other nearby cells from the skin, or from different origins. However, the extent and underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this opinion, we discuss the possible relevant role of skin senescence in the induction of aging phenotypes to other organs/tissues, contributing to whole-body aging.

      "abstract": "The field of research on cellular senescence experienced a rapid expansion from being primarily focused on in vitro aspects of aging to the vast territories of animal and clinical research. Cellular senescence is defined by a set of markers, many of which are present and accumulate in a gradual manner prior to senescence induction or are found outside of the context of cellular senescence. These markers are now used to measure the impact of cellular senescence on aging and disease as well as outcomes of anti-senescence interventions, many of which are at the stage of clinical trials. It is thus of primary importance to discuss their specificity as well as their role in the establishment of senescence. Here, the presence and role of senescence markers are described in cells prior to cell cycle arrest, especially in the context of replicative aging and in vivo conditions. Specifically, this review article seeks to describe the process of \"cellular aging\": the progression of internal changes occurring in primary cells leading to the induction of cellular senescence and culminating in cell death. Phenotypic changes associated with aging prior to senescence induction will be characterized, as well as their effect on the induction of cell senescence and the final fate of cells reviewed. Using published datasets on assessments of senescence markers in vivo, it will be described how disparities between quantifications can be explained by the concept of cellular aging. Finally, throughout the article the applicational value of broadening cellular senescence paradigm will be discussed.",

      "title": "Cellular Senescence: From Mechanisms to Current Biomarkers and Senotherapies.",
      "abstract": "An increase in life expectancy in developed countries has led to a surge of chronic aging-related diseases. In the last few decades, several studies have provided evidence of the prominent role of cellular senescence in many of these pathologies. Key traits of senescent cells include cell cycle arrest, apoptosis resistance, and secretome shift to senescence-associated secretory phenotype resulting in increased secretion of various intermediate bioactive factors important for senescence pathophysiology. However, cellular senescence is a highly phenotypically heterogeneous process, hindering the discovery of totally specific and accurate biomarkers. Also, strategies to prevent the pathologic effect of senescent cell accumulation during aging by impairing senescence onset or promoting senescent cell clearance have shown great potential during in vivo studies, and some are already in early stages of clinical translation. The adaptability of these senotherapeutic approaches to human application has been questioned due to the lack of proper senescence targeting and senescence involvement in important physiologic functions. In this review, we explore the heterogeneous phenotype of senescent cells and its influence on the expression of biomarkers currently used for senescence detection. We also discuss the current evidence regarding the efficacy, reliability, development stage, and potential for human applicability of the main existing senotherapeutic strategies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This paper is an extensive review of what is currently known about the complex process of cellular senescence and explores its most defining features. The main body of the discussion focuses on how the multifeature fluctuation of the senescence phenotype and the physiological role of cellular senescence have both caused a limitation in the search for truly reliable senescence biomarkers and the progression in the development of senotherapies.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a kind of cellular state triggered by endogenous or exogenous stimuli, which is mainly characterized by stable cell cycle arrest and complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Once senescent cells accumulate in tissues, they may eventually accelerate the progression of age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, chronic lung diseases, cancers, etc. Recent studies have shown that the disorders of lipid metabolism are not only related to age-related diseases, but also regulate the cellular senescence process. Based on existing research evidences, the changes in lipid metabolism in senescent cells are mainly concentrated in the metabolic processes of phospholipids, fatty acids and cholesterol. Obviously, the changes in lipid-metabolizing enzymes and proteins involved in these pathways play a critical role in senescence. However, the link between cellular senescence, changes in lipid metabolism and age-related disease remains to be elucidated. Herein, we summarize the lipid metabolism changes in senescent cells, especially the senescent cells that promote age-related diseases, as well as focusing on the role of lipid-related enzymes or proteins in senescence. Finally, we explore the prospect of lipids in cellular senescence and their potential as drug targets for preventing and delaying age-related diseases.",

Recent studies have also described new senescence markers beyond p16 and have highlighted the importance of investigating senescence heterogeneity in cell types and tissues. With the development of high-throughput technologies, such as single-cell RNA-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq, we can examine senescent cells at the single-cell level and potentially uncover new markers. This review emphasizes that there is an urgent need to investigate senescence heterogeneity and discuss how this could be accomplished by using advanced technologies and sequencing datasets.",

It has many endogenous and exogenous inducers, and is closely connected with age, age-related pathologies, DNA damage, degenerative disorders, tumor suppression and activation, wound healing, and tissue repair. However, the literature is replete with contradictory findings concerning its triggering mechanisms, specific biomarkers, and detection protocols. This may be partly due to the wide range of cellular and in vivo animal or human models of accelerated aging that have been used to study senescence and test senolytic drugs.

      "abstract": "Most adult organs contain regenerative stem cells, often organized in specific niches. Stem cell function is critical for tissue homeostasis and repair upon injury, and it is dependent on interactions with the niche. During ageing, stem cells decline in their regenerative potential and ability to give rise to differentiated cells in the tissue, which is associated with a deterioration of tissue integrity and health. Ageing-associated changes in regenerative tissue regions include defects in maintenance of stem cell quiescence, differentiation ability and bias, clonal expansion and infiltration of immune cells in the niche. In this Review, we discuss cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying ageing in the regenerative regions of different tissues as well as potential rejuvenation strategies. We focus primarily on brain, muscle and blood tissues, but also provide examples from other tissues, such as skin and intestine. We describe the complex interactions between different cell types, non-cell-autonomous mechanisms between ageing niches and stem cells, and the influence of systemic factors. We also compare different interventions for the rejuvenation of old regenerative regions. Future outlooks in the field of stem cell ageing are discussed, including strategies to counter ageing and age-dependent disease.",

Yet, the increasing prevalence of sedentariness constitutes a major public health issue that contributes to premature aging but the potential cellular mechanisms through which prolonged immobilization may accelerate biological aging remain unestablished. This narrative review summarizes the impact of sedentary behavior using different models of extreme sedentary behaviors including bedrest, unilateral limb suspension and space travel studies, on the hallmarks of aging such as genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication.

Clinical evidence has revealed a strong connection between cellular senescence and worse cardiac outcomes in the majority of CVDs concerning both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Cellular senescence is characterized by cell cycle arrest accompanied by alterations in several metabolic pathways, resulting in morphological and functional changes. Metabolic rewiring of senescent cells results in marked paracrine activity, through a unique secretome, often exerting deleterious effects on neighboring cells. Here, we recapitulate the hallmarks and key molecular pathways involved in cellular senescence in the cardiac context and summarize the different roles of senescence in the majority of CVDs. In the last few years, the possibility of eliminating senescent cells in various pathological conditions has been increasingly explored, giving rise to the field of senotherapeutics. Therefore, we additionally attempt to clarify the current state of this field with a focus on cardiac senescence and discuss the potential of implementing senolytics as a treatment option in heart disease.",

      "abstract": "The idea that senescent cells are causally involved in aging has gained strong support from findings that the removal of such cells alleviates many age-related diseases and extends the life span of mice. While efforts proceed to make therapeutic use of such discoveries, it is important to ask what evolutionary forces might have been behind the emergence of cellular senescence, in order better to understand the biology that we might seek to alter. Cellular senescence is often regarded as an anti-cancer mechanism, since it limits the division potential of cells. However, many studies have shown that senescent cells often also have carcinogenic properties. This is difficult to reconcile with the simple idea of an anti-cancer mechanism. Furthermore, other studies have shown that cellular senescence is involved in wound healing and tissue repair. Here, we bring these findings and ideas together and discuss the possibility that these functions might be the main reason for the evolution of cellular senescence. Furthermore, we discuss the idea that senescent cells might accumulate with age because the immune system had to strike a balance between false negatives (overlooking some senescent cells) and false positives (destroying healthy body cells).",

      "abstract": "Myofibroblasts play an important role in fibrogenesis. Hepatic stellate cells are the main precursors of myofibroblasts. Cellular senescence is the terminal cell fate in which proliferating cells undergo irreversible cell cycle arrest. Senescent hepatic stellate cells were identified in liver fibrosis. Senescent hepatic stellate cells display decreased collagen production and proliferation. Therefore, induction of senescence could be a protective mechanism against progression of liver fibrosis and the concept of therapy-induced senescence has been proposed to treat liver fibrosis. In this review, characteristics of senescent hepatic stellate cells and the essential signaling pathways involved in senescence are reviewed. Furthermore, the potential impact of senescent hepatic stellate cells on other liver cell types are discussed. Senescent cells are cleared by the immune system. The persistence of senescent cells can remodel the microenvironment and interact with inflammatory cells to induce aging-related dysfunction. Therefore, senolytics, a class of compounds that selectively induce death of senescent cells, were introduced as treatment to remove senescent cells and consequently decrease the disadvantageous effects of persisting senescent cells. The effects of senescent hepatic stellate cells in liver fibrosis need further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence (CS), a permanent and irreversible arrest of the cell cycle and proliferation leading to the degeneration of cellular structure and function, has been implicated in various key physiological and pathological processes, particularly in cancer. Initially, CS was recognized as a barrier to tumorigenesis, serving as an intrinsic defense mechanism to protect cells from malignant transformation. However, increasing evidence suggests that senescent cells can promote tumor progression to overt malignancy, primarily through a set of factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), including chemokines, growth factors, cytokines, and stromal metalloproteinases. These factors significantly reshape the tumor microenvironment (TME), enabling tumors to evade immune destruction. Interestingly, some studies have also suggested that SASPs may impede tumor development by enhancing immunosurveillance. These opposing roles highlight the complexity and heterogeneity of CS and SASPs in diverse cancers. Consequently, there has been growing interest in pharmacological interventions targeting CS or SASPs in cancer therapy, such as senolytics and senomorphics, to either promote the clearance of senescent cells or mitigate the harmful effects of SASPs. In this review, we will interpret the concept of CS, delve into the role of SASPs in reshaping the TME, and summarize recent advances in anti-tumor strategies targeting CS or SASPs.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a multifaceted and complicated process, manifested by a decline of normal physiological functions across tissues and organs, leading to overt frailty, mortality, and chronic diseases, such as skeletal, cardiovascular, and cognitive disorders, necessitating the development of practical therapeutic approaches. Stem cell aging is one of the leading theories of organismal aging. For decades, mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have been regarded as a viable and ideal source for stem cell-based therapy in anti-aging treatment due to their outstanding clinical characteristics, including easy accessibility, simplicity of isolation, self-renewal and proliferation ability, multilineage differentiation potentials, and immunomodulatory effects. Nonetheless, as evidenced in numerous studies, MSCs undergo functional deterioration and gradually lose stemness with systematic age in vivo or extended culture in vitro, limiting their therapeutic applications. Even though our understanding of the processes behind MSC senescence remains unclear, significant progress has been achieved in elucidating the aspects of the age-related MSC phenotypic changes and possible mechanisms driving MSC senescence. In this review, we aim to summarize the current knowledge of the morphological, biological, and stem-cell marker alterations of aging MSCs, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie MSC senescence, the recent progress made regarding the innovative techniques to rejuvenate senescent MSCs and combat aging, with a particular focus on the interplay between aging MSCs and their niche as well as clinical translational relevance. Also, we provide some promising and novel directions for future research concerning MSC senescence.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is a heterogeneous chronic respiratory disease that impacts nearly 10% of the population worldwide. While cellular senescence is a normal physiological process, the accumulation of senescent cells is considered a trigger that transforms physiology into the pathophysiology of a tissue/organ. Recent advances have suggested the significance of cellular senescence in asthma. With this review, we focus on the literature regarding the physiology and pathophysiology of cellular senescence and cellular stress responses that link the triggers of asthma to cellular senescence, including telomere shortening, DNA damage, oncogene activation, oxidative-related senescence, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The association of cellular senescence to asthma phenotypes, airway inflammation and remodeling, was also reviewed. Importantly, several approaches targeting cellular senescence, such as senolytics and senomorphics, have emerged as promising strategies for asthma treatment. Therefore, cellular senescence might represent a mechanism in asthma, and the senescence-related molecules and pathways could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.",

      "title": "Ferroptosis and Senescence: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Senescence is a cellular aging process in all multicellular organisms. It is characterized by a decay in cellular functions and proliferation, resulting in increased cellular damage and death. This condition plays an essential role in the aging process and significantly contributes to the development of age-related complications. On the other hand, ferroptosis is a systemic cell death pathway characterized by excessive iron accumulation followed by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress is a common trigger of this condition and may be induced by various factors such as toxins, drugs, and inflammation. Ferroptosis is linked to numerous disorders, including cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Senescence is believed to contribute to the decay in tissue and organ functions occurring with aging. It has also been linked to the development of age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In particular, senescent cells have been shown to produce inflammatory cytokines and other pro-inflammatory molecules that can contribute to these conditions. In turn, ferroptosis has been linked to the development of various health disorders, including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Ferroptosis is known to play a role in the development of these pathologies by promoting the death of damaged or diseased cells and contributing to the inflammation often associated. Both senescence and ferroptosis are complex pathways that are still not fully understood. Further research is needed to thoroughly investigate the role of these processes in aging and disease, and to identify potential interventions to target such processes in order to prevent or treat age-related conditions. This systematic review aims to assess the potential mechanisms underlying the link connecting senescence, ferroptosis, aging, and disease, and whether they can be exploited to block or limit the decay of the physiological functions in elderly people for a healthy longevity.",

      "title": "Skeletal muscle aging, cellular senescence, and senotherapeutics: Current knowledge and future directions.",
      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest induced by several forms of metabolic stress. Senescent cells accumulate with advancing age and have a distinctive phenotype, characterized by profound chromatin alterations and a robust senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that exerts negative effects on tissue health, both locally and systemically. In preclinical models, pharmacological agents that eliminate senescent cells (senotherapeutics) restore health and youthful properties in multiple tissues. To date, however, very little is understood about the vulnerability of terminally-differentiated skeletal muscle fibers and the resident mononuclear cells that populate the interstitial microenvironment of skeletal muscle to senescence, and their contribution to the onset and progression of skeletal muscle loss and dysfunction with aging. Scientific advances in these areas have the potential to highlight new therapeutic approaches to optimize late-life muscle health. To this end, this review highlights the current evidence and the key questions that need to be addressed to advance the field's understanding of cellular senescence as a mediator of skeletal muscle aging and the potential for emerging senescent cell-targeting therapies to counter age-related deficits in muscle mass, strength, and function.

      "abstract": "Cancer therapies, including conventional chemotherapy, radiation, and molecularly targeted agents, can lead to tumor eradication through a variety of mechanisms. In addition to their effects on tumor cell growth and survival, these regimens can also influence the surrounding tumor-immune microenvironment in ways that ultimately impact therapy responses. A unique biological outcome of cancer therapy is induction of cellular senescence. Senescence is a damage-induced stress program that leads to both the durable arrest of tumor cells and remodeling the tumor-immune microenvironment through activation of a collection pleiotropic cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and proteinases known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Depending on the cancer context and the mechanism of action of the therapy, the SASP produced following therapy-induced senescence (TIS) can promote anti-tumor immunity that enhances therapeutic efficacy, or alternatively chronic inflammation that leads to therapy failure and tumor relapse. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms regulating the SASP and components necessary for robust anti-tumor immune surveillance in different cancer and therapy contexts are key to harnessing senescence for tumor control. Here we draw a roadmap to modulate TIS and its immune-stimulating features for cancer immunotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Cell size is tightly controlled in healthy tissues, but it is unclear how deviations in cell size affect cell physiology. To address this, we measured how the cell's proteome changes with increasing cell size. Size-dependent protein concentration changes are widespread and predicted by subcellular localization, size-dependent mRNA concentrations, and protein turnover. As proliferating cells grow larger, concentration changes typically associated with cellular senescence are increasingly pronounced, suggesting that large size may be a cause rather than just a consequence of cell senescence. Consistent with this hypothesis, larger cells are prone to replicative, DNA-damage-induced, and CDK4/6i-induced senescence. Size-dependent changes to the proteome, including those associated with senescence, are not observed when an increase in cell size is accompanied by an increase in ploidy. Together, our findings show how cell size could impact many aspects of cell physiology by remodeling the proteome and provide a rationale for cell size control and polyploidization.",

      "abstract": "Population aging has increased the global prevalence of aging-related diseases, including cancer, sarcopenia, neurological disease, arthritis, and heart disease. Understanding aging, a fundamental biological process, has led to breakthroughs in several fields. Cellular senescence, evinced by flattened cell bodies, vacuole formation, and cytoplasmic granules, ubiquitously plays crucial roles in tissue remodeling, embryogenesis, and wound repair as well as in cancer therapy and aging. The lack of universal biomarkers for detecting and quantifying senescent cells, in vitro and in vivo, constitutes a major limitation. The applications and limitations of major senescence biomarkers, including senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining, telomere shortening, cell-cycle arrest, DNA methylation, and senescence-associated secreted phenotypes are discussed. Furthermore, explore senotherapeutic approaches for aging-associated diseases and cancer. In addition to the conventional biomarkers, this review highlighted the in vitro, in vivo, and disease models used for aging studies. Further, technologies from the current decade including multi-omics and computational methods used in the fields of senescence and aging are also discussed in this review. Understanding aging-associated biological processes by using cellular senescence biomarkers can enable therapeutic innovation and interventions to improve the quality of life of older adults.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence, classically defined as stable cell cycle arrest, is implicated in biological processes such as embryogenesis, wound healing and ageing. Senescent cells have a complex senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), involving a range of pro-inflammatory factors with important paracrine and autocrine effects on cell and tissue biology. Clinical evidence and experimental studies link cellular senescence, senescent cell accumulation, and the production and release of SASP components with age-related cardiac pathologies such as heart failure, myocardial ischaemia and infarction, and cancer chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity. However, the precise role of senescent cells in these conditions is unclear and, in some instances, both detrimental and beneficial effects have been reported. The involvement of cellular senescence in other important entities, such as cardiac arrhythmias and remodelling, is poorly understood. In this Review, we summarize the basic biology of cellular senescence and discuss what is known about the role of cellular senescence and the SASP in heart disease. We then consider the various approaches that are being developed to prevent the accumulation of senescent cells and their consequences. Many of these strategies are applicable in vivo and some are being investigated for non-cardiac indications in clinical trials. We end by considering important knowledge gaps, directions for future research and the potential implications for improving the management of patients with heart disease.",

      "abstract": "Increasing evidence has revealed that cellular senescence drives NDs, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease. Different senescent cell populations secrete senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), including matrix metalloproteinase-3, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-6, and IL-8, which can harm adjacent microglia. Moreover, these cells possess high expression levels of senescence hallmarks (p16 and p21) and elevated senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in in vitro and in vivo ND models. These senescence phenotypes contribute to the deposition of β-amyloid and tau-protein tangles. Selective clearance of senescent cells and SASP regulation by inhibiting p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B signaling attenuate β-amyloid load and prevent tau-protein tangle deposition, thereby improving cognitive performance in AD mouse models. In addition, telomere shortening, a cellular senescence biomarker, is associated with increased ND risks. Telomere dysfunction causes cellular senescence, stimulating IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and IL-1β secretions. The forced expression of telomerase activators prevents cellular senescence, yielding considerable neuroprotective effects. This review elucidates the mechanism of cellular senescence in ND pathogenesis, suggesting strategies to eliminate or restore senescent cells to a normal phenotype for treating such diseases.",

Using a mouse model of p21 overexpression (p21OE), we examined if p21 mechanistically contributes to cellular senescence and pathological features in skeletal muscle. We show that p21 induces several core properties of cellular senescence in skeletal muscle, including an altered transcriptome, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Furthermore, p21OE mice exhibit manifestations of skeletal muscle pathology, such as atrophy, fibrosis, and impaired physical function when compared to age-matched controls. These findings suggest p21 alone is sufficient to drive a cellular senescence program and reveal a novel source of skeletal muscle loss and dysfunction.",

While this process is crucial for tissue homeostasis and tumor suppression, the progressive accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) over time is implicated in age-related pathologies, including immune dysfunction and cancer. In oncology, senescence plays a paradoxical role: it can inhibit tumor development by halting the growth of potentially malignant cells, yet it may also facilitate tumor progression through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This review explores the defining features of senescence in cancer, its complex interactions with tumor cells, the stroma, and the immune system, and its context-dependent outcomes. We also discuss current and emerging therapeutic strategies that target SnCs-either by inducing or eliminating them-as well as AI-driven approaches for their detection and characterization in cancer.",

Senescent cells undergo a stable cell cycle arrest, undergo a change in morphology and metabolic reprogramming, and produce a bioactive secretome termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). In cancer, senescence is an important barrier to tumor progression. Induction of senescence in preneoplastic cells limits cancer initiation, and many cancer therapies act in part by inducing senescence in cancer cells. Paradoxically, senescent cells lingering in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can contribute to tumor progression, metastasis, and therapy resistance. In this review, we discuss the different types of senescent cells present in the TME and how these senescent cells and their SASP reshape the TME, affect immune responses, and influence cancer progression. Furthermore, we will highlight the importance of senotherapies, including senolytic drugs that eliminate senescent cells and impede tumor progression and metastasis by restoring anti-tumor immune responses and influencing the TME.",

      "abstract": "Magnesium is an essential ion in the human body that regulates numerous physiological and pathological processes. Magnesium deficiency is very common in old age. Age-related chronic diseases and the aging process itself are frequently associated with low-grade chronic inflammation, called 'inflammaging'. Because chronic magnesium insufficiency has been linked to excessive generation of inflammatory markers and free radicals, inducing a chronic inflammatory state, we formerly hypothesized that magnesium inadequacy may be considered among the intermediaries helping us explain the link between inflammaging and aging-associated diseases. We show in this review evidence of the relationship of magnesium with all the hallmarks of aging (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, disabled autophagy, dysbiosis, and chronic inflammation), which may positively affect the human healthspan. It is feasible to hypothesize that maintaining an optimal balance of magnesium during one's life course may turn out to be a safe and economical strategy contributing to the promotion of healthy aging. Future well-designed studies are necessary to further explore this hypothesis.",

We report here a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and senolytic responses in a panel of 13 cancer cell lines rendered senescent by two distinct compounds. We show that in cancer cells, the response to senolytic agents and the composition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype are more influenced by the cell of origin than by the senescence trigger.

Thus, senescence has a crucial role in development, tissue maintenance and cancer prevention. However, lingering senescent cells fuel chronic inflammation through the acquisition of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributes to cancer and age-related tissue dysfunction. Recent progress in understanding senescence has spurred interest in the development of approaches to target senescent cells, known as senotherapies. In this Review, we evaluate the status of various types of senotherapies, including senolytics that eliminate senescent cells, senomorphics that suppress the SASP, interventions that mitigate senescence and strategies that harness the immune system to clear senescent cells. We also summarize how these approaches can be combined with cancer therapies, and we discuss the challenges and opportunities in moving senotherapies into clinical practice. Such therapies have the potential to address root causes of age-related diseases and thus open new avenues for preventive therapies and treating multimorbidities.",

      "abstract": "Ovarian aging is considered to be the pacemaker of female aging, and is linked to various comorbidities such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, and cognitive decline. Many efforts have been made to determine the mechanisms underlying ovarian aging, but their potential to act as hallmarks to predict and intervene in this process currently remains unclear. In this review we propose nine hallmarks as common features of ovarian aging: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, impaired autophagy, cellular senescence, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Understanding the interaction between these hallmarks poses a significant challenge but may also pave the way to the identification of pharmaceutical targets that can attenuate ovarian aging.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a cell fate driven by different types of stress, where damaged cells exit from the cell cycle and, in many cases, develop an inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence has often been linked to driving aging and the onset of multiple diseases conferred by the harmful SASP, which disrupts tissue homeostasis and impairs the regular function of many tissues. This phenomenon was first observed in vitro when fibroblasts halted replication after approximately 50 population doublings. In addition to replication-induced senescence, factors such as DNA damage and oncogene activation can induce cellular senescence both in culture and in vivo. Despite their contribution to aging and disease, identifying senescent cells in vivo has been challenging due to their heterogeneity.

      "abstract": "Ageing is the largest risk factor for many chronic diseases. Studies of heterochronic parabiosis, substantiated by blood exchange and old plasma dilution, show that old-age-related factors are systemically propagated and have pro-geronic effects in young mice. However, the underlying mechanisms how bloodborne factors promote ageing remain largely unknown. Here, using heterochronic blood exchange in male mice, we show that aged mouse blood induces cell and tissue senescence in young animals after one single exchange. This induction of senescence is abrogated if old animals are treated with senolytic drugs before blood exchange, therefore attenuating the pro-geronic influence of old blood on young mice. Hence, cellular senescence is neither simply a response to stress and damage that increases with age, nor a chronological cell-intrinsic phenomenon. Instead, senescence quickly and robustly spreads to young mice from old blood. Clearing senescence cells that accumulate with age rejuvenates old circulating blood and improves the health of multiple tissues.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence is an aging mechanism characterized by cell cycle arrest and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Preclinical studies demonstrate that senolytic drugs, which target survival pathways in senescent cells, can counteract age-associated conditions that span several organs. The comparative efficacy of distinct senolytic drugs for modifying aging and senescence biomarkers in vivo has not been demonstrated. Here, we established aging- and senescence-related plasma proteins and tissue transcripts that changed in old versus young female and male mice. We investigated responsivity to acute treatment with venetoclax, navitoclax, fisetin or luteolin versus transgenic senescent cell clearance in aged p16-InkAttac mice. We discovered that age-dependent changes in plasma proteins, including IL-23R, CCL5 and CA13, were reversed by senotherapeutics, which corresponded to expression differences in tissues, particularly in the kidney. In plasma from humans across the lifespan, IL-23R increased with age. Our results reveal circulating factors as candidate mediators of senescence-associated interorgan signal transduction and translationally impactful biomarkers of systemic senescent cell burden.",

      "abstract": "Muscle inflammation and fibrosis underlie disuse-related complications and may contribute to impaired muscle recovery in aging. Cellular senescence is an emerging link between inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and poor muscle recovery after disuse. In rodents, metformin has been shown to prevent cellular senescence/senescent associated secretory phenotype (SASP), inflammation, and fibrosis making it a potentially practical therapeutic solution. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine in older adults if metformin monotherapy during bed rest could reduce muscle fibrosis and cellular senescence/SASP during the re-ambulation period. A two-arm controlled trial was utilized in healthy male and female older adults (n = 20; BMI: <30, age: 60 years+) randomized into either placebo or metformin treatment during a two-week run-in and 5 days of bedrest followed by metformin withdrawal during 7 days of recovery. We found that metformin-treated individuals had less type-I myofiber atrophy during disuse, reduced pro-inflammatory transcriptional profiles, and lower muscle collagen deposition during recovery. Collagen content and myofiber size corresponded to reduced whole muscle cellular senescence and SASP markers. Moreover, metformin treatment reduced primary muscle resident fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) senescent markers and promoted a shift in fibroblast fate to be less myofibroblast-like. Together, these results suggest that metformin pre-treatment improved ECM remodeling after disuse in older adults by possibly altering cellular senescence and SASP in skeletal muscle and in FAPs.",

      "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a stable state of cell cycle arrest induced by various stressors or genomic damage, is recognized as a hallmark of cancer. It exerts a context-dependent dual role in cancer initiation and progression, functioning as a tumor suppressor and promoter. The complexity of senescence in cancer arises from its mechanistic diversity, potential reversibility, and heterogeneity. A key mediator of these effects is the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a repertoire of bioactive molecules that influence tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling, modulate cancer cell behavior, and contribute to therapeutic resistance. Given its intricate role in cancer biology, senescence presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Strategies targeting senescence pathways, including senescence-inducing therapies and senolytic approaches, offer promising avenues for cancer treatment. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the regulatory mechanisms governing cellular senescence in tumors. We also discuss emerging strategies to modulate senescence, highlighting novel therapeutic opportunities. A deeper understanding of these processes is essential for developing precision therapies and improving clinical outcomes.",

The worldwide prevalence of AD is approximately 50 million people, and this number is projected to increase substantially. The molecular mechanisms underlying the aging-associated susceptibility to cognitive impairment in AD are largely unknown. As a hallmark of aging, cellular senescence is a significant contributor to aging and age-related diseases including AD. Senescent neurons and glial cells have been detected to accumulate in the brains of AD patients and mouse models. Importantly, selective elimination of senescent cells ameliorates amyloid beta and tau pathologies and improves cognition in AD mouse models, indicating a critical role of cellular senescence in AD pathogenesis. Nonetheless, the mechanisms underlying when and how cellular senescence contributes to AD pathogenesis remain unclear. This review provides an overview of cellular senescence and discusses recent advances in the understanding of the impact of cellular senescence on AD pathogenesis, with brief discussions of the possible role of cellular senescence in other neurodegenerative diseases including Down syndrome, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "The resistance of tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) may be intricately linked to cellular senescence, although definitive clinical validation remains elusive. In this study, comprehensive pan-cancer scRNA-seq analyses identify fibroblasts as exhibiting the most pronounced levels of cellular senescence among tumor-associated cell populations. To elucidate this phenomenon, a fibroblast senescence-associated transcriptomic signature (FSS), which correlated strongly with protumorigenic signaling pathways and immune dysregulation that fosters tumor progression, is developed. Leveraging the FSS, the machine learning (ML) framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting ICI response and survival outcomes, achieving superior area under curve (AUC) values across validation, testing, and in-house cohorts. Strikingly, FSS consistently outperforms established signatures in predictive robustness across diverse cancer subtypes. From an integrative analysis of 17 CRISPR/Cas9 libraries, CDC6 emerges as a pivotal biomarker for pan-cancer ICI response and prognostic stratification. Mechanistically, experimental evidence reveals that CDC6 in tumor cells orchestrates fibroblast senescence via TGF-β1 secretion and oxidative stress, subsequently reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and modulating ICI response. These findings underscore the translational potential of targeting fibroblast senescence as a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate immune resistance and enhance antitumor efficacy.",

The skin barrier, the elastic and mechanical properties of the cutaneous tissue as well as its vascular reactivity are impacted by aging. The barrier dysfunction in aged skin is caused by defects in epidermal keratinocytes renewal and differentiation notably linked to abnormal expression of microRNAs regulating cell death and autophagy. An abnormal balance between synthesis and degradation of matrix proteins modifies the mechanical properties of the dermis in aged skin. Finally, a reduction of the vascular reactivity linked to endothelial dysfunctions is observed in elderly people. These biological processes can be targeted by therapeutic approaches either topical or systemic, especially using anti-oxydants or senolytics. These anti-aging strategies might contribute to restore, at least in part, the functional integrity of aged skin.",

      "abstract": "Macroautophagy/autophagy plays a pivotal role in immune regulation. Its significance is evident in modulation of immune cell differentiation and maturation, physiologically and pathologically. Here, we investigate the role of macrophage autophagy on the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). By employing an MC903-induced AD mice model, we observe reduced cutaneous inflammation in macrophage Atg5 cKO mice compared with WT mice. Notably, there is a decreased infiltration of M2 macrophages in lesional skin from Atg5 cKO mice. Furthermore, impaired STAT6 phosphorylation and diminished expression of M2 markers are detected in autophagy-deficient macrophages. Our mechanistic exploration reveals that CEBPB drives the transcription of SOCS1/3 and SQSTM1/p62-mediated autophagy degrades CEBPB normally. Autophagy deficiency leads to CEBPB accumulation, and further promotes the expression of SOCS1/3. This process inhibits JAK1-STAT6 pathway activation and M2 marker expression. Together, our study indicates that autophagy is required for M2 activation and macrophage autophagy may be a promising target for AD intervention.",

      "title": "Metformin Attenuates UVA-Induced Skin Photoaging by Suppressing Mitophagy and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway.",
      "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major cause of photoaging that can induce DNA damage, oxidative stress, and cellular aging. Metformin (MF) can repair DNA damage, scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cells. However, the mechanism by which MF inhibits cell senescence in chronic skin damage induced by UVA is unclear. In this study, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) treated with UVA were used as an in vitro model and UVA-induced skin photoaging in Kunming mice was used as an in vivo model to investigate the potential skin protective mechanism of MF. The results revealed that MF treatment attenuated UVA-induced cell viability, skin aging, and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Furthermore, MF treatment alleviated the mitochondrial oxidative stress and decreased mitophagy. Knockdown of Parkin by siRNA increased the clearance of MF in senescent cells. The treatment of Kunming mice with MF at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day significantly reduced UVA-induced skin roughness, epidermal thinning, collagen degradation, and skin aging. In conclusion, our experimental results suggest that MF exerts anti-photoaging effects by inhibiting mitophagy and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Therefore, our study improves the current understanding of the protective mechanism of MF against photoaging.",

      "abstract": "Skin photoaging is mostly caused by ultraviolet A (UVA), although active medications to effectively counteract UVA-induced photoaging have not yet been created. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring polyphenol found in the skin of grapes, has been shown to have various biological functions such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant characteristics. However, the role of resveratrol in UVA-induced photoaging has not been clarified. We investigated the mechanism of action of resveratrol by UVA irradiation of human skin fibroblasts (HSF) and innovatively modified a mouse model of photoaging. The results demonstrated that resveratrol promoted AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation to activate autophagy, reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inhibit apoptosis, and restore normal cell cycle to alleviate UVA-induced photoaging. In addition, subcutaneous injection of resveratrol not only improved the symptoms of roughness, erythema, and increased wrinkles in the skin of UVA photodamaged mice, but also alleviated epidermal hyperkeratosis and hyperpigmentation, reduced inflammatory responses, and inhibited collagen fiber degradation. In conclusion, our studies proved that resveratrol can treat UVA-induced photoaging and elucidated the possible molecular mechanisms involved, providing a new therapeutic strategy for future anti-aging.",

Several drugs that target Th1/Th17 cytokines or their receptors have been approved for treating psoriasis in humans with variable results necessitating improved therapies.

      "title": "The role of mitochondrial quality surveillance in skin aging: Focus on mitochondrial dynamics, biogenesis and mitophagy.",
      "abstract": "The skin is the largest organ of the human body and the first line of defense against environmental hazards. Many factors, including internal factors such as natural aging and external factors such as ultraviolet radiation and air pollution, can lead to skin aging. Mitochondria provide sufficient energy to maintain the high-speed turnover capacity of the skin, so the quality control of mitochondria plays an indispensable role in this process. Mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy are the key steps in mitochondrial quality surveillance. They are coordinated to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and restore damaged mitochondrial function. All of the mitochondrial quality control processes are related to skin aging caused by various factors. Therefore, fine-tuning regulation of the above process is of great significance to the skin aging problem that needs to be solved urgently. This article mainly reviews the physiological and environmental factors causing skin aging, the effects of mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy on skin aging, as well as their specific regulatory mechanisms. Finally, mitochondrial biomarkers for diagnosis of skin aging, and therapeutic approaches of skin aging via mitochondrial quality control were illustrated.",

Although numerous studies have been conducted on the pathogenesis of vitiligo, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Although most studies have focused on melanocytes and keratinocytes, growing evidence suggests the involvement of dermal fibroblasts, residing deeper in the skin. This review aims to elucidate the role of fibroblasts in both the physiological regulation of skin pigmentation and their pathological contribution to depigmentation, with the goal of shedding light on the involvement of fibroblasts in vitiligo. The topics covered in this review include alterations in the secretome, premature senescence, autophagy dysfunction, abnormal extracellular matrix, autoimmunity, and metabolic changes.",

      "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in microenvironments, referred to as niches, which provide structural support and molecular signals. Sensory nerves are niche components in the homeostasis of tissues such as skin, bone marrow and hematopoietic system. However, how the sensory nerve affects the behavior of MSCs remains largely unknown. Here we show that the sensory nerve is vital for mesenchymal tissue homeostasis and maintenance of MSCs in the continuously growing adult mouse incisor. Loss of sensory innervation leads to mesenchymal disorder and a decrease in MSCs. Mechanistically, FGF1 from the sensory nerve directly acts on MSCs by binding to FGFR1 and activates the mTOR/autophagy axis to sustain MSCs. Modulation of mTOR/autophagy restores the MSCs and rescues the mesenchymal tissue disorder of Fgfr1 mutant mice. Collectively, our study provides insights into the role of sensory nerves in the regulation of MSC homeostasis and the mechanism governing it.",

Necroptosis is thought to contribute to flap necrosis. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) plays an indispensable role in the regulation of necroptosis. Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which lysosomal membranes become leaky and the relationship between necroptosis and lysosomes are still unclear in ischemic flaps. Based on Western blotting, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis results, we found that LMP was presented in the ischemic distal portion of random-pattern skin flaps, which leads to disruption of lysosomal function and macroautophagic/autophagic flux, increased necroptosis, and aggravated necrosis of the ischemic flaps. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of the LC-MS results enabled us to focus on the role of PLA2G4E/cPLA2 (phospholipase A2, group IVE) in LMP of the ischemic flaps. ",

      "abstract": "Autophagy is a vital process for cell survival and it preserves homeostasis by recycling or disassembling unnecessary or dysfunctional cellular constituents. Autophagy ameliorates skin integrity, regulating epidermal differentiation and constitutive pigmentation. It induces melanogenesis and contributes to skin color through melanosome turnover. Autophagy activity is involved in skin phenotypic plasticity and cell function maintenance and, if altered, it concurs to the onset and/or progression of hypopigmentary and hyperpigmentary disorders. Overexpression of autophagy exerts a protective role against the intrinsic metabolic stress occurring in vitiligo skin, while its dysfunction has been linked to the tuberous sclerosis complex hypopigmentation. Again, autophagy impairment reduces melanosome degradation by concurring to pigment accumulation characterizing senile lentigo and melasma. Here we provide an updated review that describes recent findings on the crucial role of autophagy in skin pigmentation, thus revealing the complex interplay among melanocyte biology, skin environment and autophagy. Hence, targeting this process may also represent a promising strategy for treating pigmentary disorders.",

      "abstract": "Polyamines are molecules with multiple amino groups that are essential for cellular function. The major polyamines are putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and cadaverine. Polyamines are important for posttranscriptional regulation, autophagy, programmed cell death, proliferation, redox homeostasis, and ion channel function. Their levels are tightly controlled. High levels of polyamines are associated with proliferative pathologies such as cancer, whereas low polyamine levels are observed in aging, and elevated polyamine turnover enhances oxidative stress. Polyamine metabolism is implicated in several pathophysiological processes in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. Currently, manipulating polyamine levels is under investigation as a potential preventive treatment for several pathologies, including aging, ischemia/reperfusion injury, pulmonary hypertension, and cancer. Although polyamines have been implicated in many intracellular mechanisms, our understanding of these processes remains incomplete and is a topic of ongoing investigation. Here, we discuss the regulation and cellular functions of polyamines, their role in physiology and pathology, and emphasize the current gaps in knowledge and potential future research directions.",

Here, keratinocyte autophagy was restrained in the skin lesions of patients with AD and murine models of AD. Interestingly, hBD-3 alleviated the IL-4- and IL-13-mediated impairment of the tight junction (TJ) barrier through keratinocyte autophagy activation, which involved aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. While autophagy deficiency impaired the epidermal barrier and exacerbated inflammation, hBD-3 attenuated skin inflammation and enhanced the TJ barrier in AD. Importantly, hBD-3-mediated improvement of the TJ barrier was abolished in autophagy-deficient AD mice and in AhR-suppressed AD mice, suggesting a role for hBD-3-mediated autophagy in the regulation of the epidermal barrier and inflammation in AD. Thus, autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, and hBD-3 could be used for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Germinal center (GC) formation, which is an integrant part of humoral immunity, involves energy-consuming metabolic reprogramming. Rag-GTPases are known to signal amino acid availability to cellular pathways that regulate nutrient distribution such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway and the transcription factors TFEB and TFE3. However, the contribution of these factors to humoral immunity remains undefined. Here, we show that B cell-intrinsic Rag-GTPases are critical for the development and activation of B cells. RagA/RagB deficient B cells fail to form GCs, produce antibodies, and to generate plasmablasts during both T-dependent (TD) and T-independent (TI) humoral immune responses. Deletion of RagA/RagB in GC B cells leads to abnormal dark zone (DZ) to light zone (LZ) ratio and reduced affinity maturation. Mechanistically, the Rag-GTPase complex constrains TFEB/TFE3 activity to prevent mitophagy dysregulation and maintain mitochondrial fitness in B cells, which are independent of canonical mTORC1 activation. TFEB/TFE3 deletion restores B cell development, GC formation in Peyer's patches and TI humoral immunity, but not TD humoral immunity in the absence of Rag-GTPases. Collectively, our data establish the Rag GTPase-TFEB/TFE3 pathway as a likely mTORC1 independent mechanism to coordinating nutrient sensing and mitochondrial metabolism in B cells.",

      "abstract": "The EV-A71 poses a serious threat to the health and lives of children. The EV-A71 can be transmitted by direct and indirect skin contact. Therefore, there is an urgent need to create novel skin models using human-derived cells to study the biology and pathogenesis of the virus and facilitate drug screening. Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived skin organoids (hiPSC-SOs) as a model for EV-A71 infection and find that multiple cell types within the skin organoids, including epidermal cells, hair follicle cells, fibroblasts, and nerve cells, express EV-A71 receptors and are susceptible to EV-A71 infection. We elucidate the specific response of different cell types to EV-A71 and reveal that EV-A71 infection can degrade extracellular collagen and affect fibroblasts. We find that EV-A71 can mediate epidermal cell damage through autophagy and Integrin/Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathways, thereby promoting hyperproliferation of progenitor cells. Based on this finding, we identify an autophagy-associated protein as a drug target of EV-A71 and discover an EV-A71 replication inhibitor. Altogether, these data suggest that hiPSC-SOs can be used as an infectious disease model to study skin infectious diseases, providing a valuable resource for drug screening to identify candidate virus therapeutics.",

      "title": "Deciphering the Genetic Links between Psychological Stress, Autophagy, and Dermatological Health: Insights from Bioinformatics, Single-Cell Analysis, and Machine Learning in Psoriasis and Anxiety Disorders.",
      "abstract": "The relationship between psychological stress, altered skin immunity, and autophagy-related genes (ATGs) is currently unclear. Psoriasis is a chronic skin inflammation of unclear etiology that is characterized by persistence and recurrence. Immune dysregulation and emotional disturbances are recognized as significant risk factors. Emerging clinical evidence suggests a possible connection between anxiety disorders, heightened immune system activation, and altered skin immunity, offering a fresh perspective on the initiation of psoriasis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential shared biological mechanisms underlying the comorbidity of psoriasis and anxiety disorders. Psoriasis and anxiety disorders data were obtained from the GEO database. A list of 3254 ATGs was obtained from the public database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained by taking the intersection of DEGs between psoriasis and anxiety disorder samples and the list of ATGs. Five machine learning algorithms used screening hub genes. The ROC curve was performed to evaluate diagnostic performance. Then, GSEA, immune infiltration analysis, and network analysis were carried out. The Seurat and Monocle algorithms were used to depict T-cell evolution. Cellchat was used to infer the signaling pathway between keratinocytes and immune cells. Four key hub genes were identified as diagnostic genes related to psoriasis autophagy. Enrichment analysis showed that these genes are indeed related to T cells, autophagy, and immune regulation, and have good diagnostic efficacy validated. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we expanded our understanding of key cellular participants, including inflammatory keratinocytes and their interactions with immune cells. We found that the CASP7 gene is involved in the T-cell development process, and correlated with γδ T cells, warranting further investigation. We found that anxiety disorders are related to increased autophagy regulation, immune dysregulation, and inflammatory response, and are reflected in the onset and exacerbation of skin inflammation. The hub gene is involved in the process of immune signaling and immune regulation. The CASP7 gene, which is related with the development and differentiation of T cells, deserves further study. Potential biomarkers between psoriasis and anxiety disorders were identified, which are expected to aid in the prediction of disease diagnosis and the development of personalized treatments.",

      "abstract": "Photoaging, caused by exposure to sunlight and especially UVA, has been identified as one of the culprits for age-related skin deterioration. Here, we initially demonstrated that urolithin A (UroA), a metabolite derived from intestine microflora, possessed sufficient photoprotective capacity and attenuated UVA-induced senescent phenotypes in human fibroblasts, such as growth inhibition, senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, breakdown of extracellular matrix, synthesis of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, UroA lessened the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, which promoted the phosphorylation and afterwards nuclear translocation of NRF2, subsequently driving the activation of downstream antioxidative enzymes. In parallel, we proved that UroA restored mitochondrial function by induction of mitophagy, which was regulated by the SIRT3-FOXO3-PINK1-PARKIN network. Taken together, our results showed that UroA protected dermal fibroblast from UVA damage through NRF2/ARE activation and mitophagy process, thus supporting UroA as a potential therapeutic agent for photoaging.",

      "title": "Tranexamic acid improves psoriasis-like skin inflammation: Evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies.",
      "abstract": "The chronic disease psoriasis is associated with severe inflammation and abnormal keratinocyte propagation in the skin. Tranexamic acid (TXA), a plasmin inhibitor, is used to cure serious bleeding. We investigated whether TXA ointment mitigated Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like inflammation. Furthermore, this study investigated the effect of noncytotoxic concentrations of TXA on IL-17-induced human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells to determine the status of proliferative psoriatic keratinocytes. We found that TXA reduced IMQ-induced psoriasis-like erythema, thickness, scaling, and cumulative scores (erythema plus thickness plus scaling) on the back skin of BALB/c mice. Additionally, TXA decreased ear thickness and suppressed hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, and inflammation of the ear epidermis in IMQ-induced BALB/c mice. Furthermore, TXA inhibited IMQ-induced splenomegaly in BALB/c mouse models. In IL-17-induced HaCaT cells, TXA inhibited ROS production and IL-8 secretion. Interestingly, TXA suppressed the IL-17-induced NFκB signaling pathway via IKK-mediated IκB degradation. TXA inhibited IL-17-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through caspase-1 and IL1β expression. TXA inhibited IL-17-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation by enhancing autophagy, as indicated by LC3-II accumulation, p62/SQSTM1 expression, ATG4B inhibition, and Beclin-1/Bcl-2 dysregulation. Notably, TXA suppressed IL-17-induced Nrf2-mediated keratin 17 expression. N-acetylcysteine pretreatment reversed the effects of TXA on NFκB, NLRP3 inflammasomes, and the Nrf2-mediated keratin 17 pathway in IL-17-induced HaCaT cells. Results further confirmed that in the ear skin of IMQ-induced mice, psoriasis biomarkers such as NLRP3, IL1β, Nrf2, and keratin 17 expression were downregulated by TXA treatment. TXA improves IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation in vivo and psoriatic keratinocytes in vitro. Tranexamic acid is a promising future treatment for psoriasis.",

      "title": "Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy (4th edition)",
      "abstract": "In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for ",

      "abstract": "Autophagy is a process which is highly conserved in eukaryotes to degrade or recycle cytoplasmic components through lysosomes to maintain cellular homeostasis. Recent studies have shown that autophagy also plays critical roles in cell apoptosis, inflammation, pathogen clearance, and so on under stressed conditions and thereby has been linked to a variety of human disorders. The skin is the largest organ of the body and serves as the first line of defense against environmental insult. Skin as a nutrient-poor environment requires recycling of limited resources via the autophagy machinery to maintain homeostasis. Therefore, dysregulation of autophagy has been linked to skin diseases. In this review, we describe the molecular machinery and regulation of autophagy, discuss its role in keratinocytes and skin barrier, skin immune cells, and immune-related skin diseases including autoimmune skin disorders, allergic skin diseases, infectious skin disorders, and antitumor immunity against skin tumor. Finally, we highlight the potential of autophagy as a therapeutic target for immune-related skin diseases, and delivery of autophagy-related molecules (such as inducers, inhibitors, or nucleic acid molecules) by virtue of physical materials (such as nanoparticles) or biological materials (such as peptides) to skin topically may obtain clinical benefits in immune-related skin diseases. Moreover, developing autophagy-related gene product-based biomarkers may be promising to diagnose immune-related skin diseases.",

The major limitation is that the specific mechanism of NM-induced skin injury is not well understood. Recently, autophagy has been found to play important roles in physical and chemical exposure-caused cutaneous injuries. However, whether autophagy contributes to NM-induced dermal toxicity is unclear. Herein, we initially confirmed that NM dose-dependently caused cell death and induced autophagy in keratinocytes. Suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A1 or ATG5 siRNA attenuated NM-induced keratinocyte cell death. Furthermore, NM increased transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expression, intracellular Ca",

Although mitophagy manipulation by several RNA viruses has recently been reported, the effect of mitophagy regulation by varicella zoster virus (VZV) remains to be fully determined. In this study, we showed that dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and subsequent PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy were triggered during VZV infection, facilitating VZV replication. In addition, VZV glycoprotein E (gE) promoted PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy by interacting with LC3 and upregulating mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Importantly, VZV gE inhibited MAVS oligomerization and STING translocation to disrupt MAVS- and STING-mediated interferon (IFN) responses, and PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy was required for VZV gE-mediated inhibition of IFN production. Similarly, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)-mediated mitophagy induction led to increased VZV replication but attenuated IFN production in a three-dimensional human skin organ culture model. Our results provide new insights into the immune evasion mechanism of VZV gE via PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy.",

Autophagy is classified into three types: macrophage, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) and microphagy, which maintain cellular homeostasis through different mechanisms. Altered autophagy regulation affects the progression of various skin diseases, including psoriasis (PA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), vitiligo, atopic dermatitis (AD), alopecia areata (AA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc).

      "abstract": "Dysregulation of melanin homeostasis is implicated in causing skin pigmentation disorders, such as melasma due to hyperpigmentation and vitiligo due to hypopigmentation. Although the synthesis of melanin has been well studied, the removal of the formed skin pigment requires more research. We determined that β-mangostin, a plant-derived metabolite, induces the degradation of already-formed melanin in the mouse B16F10 cell line. The whitening effect of β-mangostin is mediated by macroautophagy/autophagy, as it was abolished by the knockdown of ATG5 or RB1CC1/FIP200, and by treatment with 3-methyladenine, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex inhibitor. However, the exact autophagy mechanism of melanosome degradation remains unknown. Selective autophagy for a specific cellular organelle requires specific E3-ligases and autophagic receptors for the target organelle. In this study, an E3-ligase, RCHY1, and an autophagy receptor, OPTN (optineurin), were identified as being essential for melanophagy in the β-mangostin-treated B16F10 cell line. As per our knowledge, this is the first report of a specific mechanism for the degradation of melanosomes, the target organelle of melanophagy. These findings are expected to broaden the scope of melanin homeostasis research and can be exploited for the development of therapeutics for skin pigmentation disorders.",

      "abstract": "Activation of fibroblasts is essential for physiological tissue repair. Uncontrolled activation of fibroblasts, however, may lead to tissue fibrosis with organ dysfunction. Although several pathways capable of promoting fibroblast activation and tissue repair have been identified, their interplay in the context of chronic fibrotic diseases remains incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) activates autophagy by an epigenetic mechanism to amplify its profibrotic effects. TGFβ induces autophagy in fibrotic diseases by SMAD3-dependent downregulation of the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase MYST1, which regulates the expression of core components of the autophagy machinery such as ATG7 and BECLIN1. Activation of autophagy in fibroblasts promotes collagen release and is both, sufficient and required, to induce tissue fibrosis. Forced expression of MYST1 abrogates the stimulatory effects of TGFβ on autophagy and re-establishes the epigenetic control of autophagy in fibrotic conditions. Interference with the aberrant activation of autophagy inhibits TGFβ-induced fibroblast activation and ameliorates experimental dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. These findings link uncontrolled TGFβ signaling to aberrant autophagy and deregulated epigenetics in fibrotic diseases and may contribute to the development of therapeutic interventions in fibrotic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Autophagy, a self-renewal mechanism, can help to maintain the stability of the intracellular environment of organisms. Autophagy can also regulate several cellular functions and is strongly related to the onset and progression of several diseases. Wound healing is a biological process that is coregulated by different types of cells. However, it is troublesome owing to prolonged treatment duration and poor recovery. In recent years, biomaterials have been reported to influence the skin wound healing process by finely regulating autophagy. Biomaterials that regulate autophagy in various cells involved in skin wound healing to regulate the differentiation, proliferation and migration of cells, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress and formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have emerged as a key method for improving the tissue regeneration ability of biomaterials. During the inflammatory phase, autophagy enhances the clearance of pathogens from the wound site and leads to macrophage polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype, thus preventing enhanced inflammation that can lead to further tissue damage. Autophagy plays important roles in facilitating the formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) during the proliferative phase, removing excess intracellular ROS, and promoting the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes. This review summarizes the close association between autophagy and skin wound healing and discusses the role of biomaterial-based autophagy in tissue regeneration. The applications of recent biomaterials designed to target autophagy are highlighted, including polymeric materials, cellular materials, metal nanomaterials, and carbon-based materials. A better understanding of biomaterial-regulated autophagy and skin regeneration and the underlying molecular mechanisms may open new possibilities for promoting skin regeneration. Moreover, this can lay the foundation for the development of more effective therapeutic approaches and novel biomaterials for clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare and fatal genetic condition that arises from a single nucleotide alteration in the LMNA gene, leading to the production of a defective lamin A protein known as progerin. The accumulation of progerin accelerates the onset of a dramatic premature aging phenotype in children with HGPS, characterized by low body weight, lipodystrophy, metabolic dysfunction, skin, and musculoskeletal age-related dysfunctions. In most cases, these children die of age-related cardiovascular dysfunction by their early teenage years. The absence of effective treatments for HGPS underscores the critical need to explore novel safe therapeutic strategies. In this study, we show that treatment with the hormone ghrelin increases autophagy, decreases progerin levels, and alleviates other cellular hallmarks of premature aging in human HGPS fibroblasts.

      "abstract": "Melanosomes are melanocyte-specific organelles that protect cells from ultraviolet (UV)-induced deoxyribonucleic acid damage through the production and accumulation of melanin and are transferred from melanocytes to keratinocytes. The relatively well-known process by which melanin is synthesized from melanocytes is known as melanogenesis. The relationship between melanogenesis and autophagy is attracting the attention of researchers because proteins associated with autophagy, such as WD repeat domain phosphoinositide-interacting protein 1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, autophagy-related (ATG)7, ATG4, beclin-1, and UV-radiation resistance-associated gene, contribute to the melanogenesis signaling pathway. Additionally, there are reports that some compounds used as whitening cosmetics materials induce skin depigmentation through autophagy. Thus, the possibility that autophagy is involved in the removal of melanin has been suggested. To date, however, there is a lack of data on melanosome autophagy and its underlying mechanism. This review highlights the importance of autophagy in melanin homeostasis by providing an overview of melanogenesis, autophagy, the autophagy machinery involved in melanogenesis, and natural compounds that induce autophagy-mediated depigmentation.",

Abnormal pigmentation is a common symptom accompanying aging skin.

Several molecular mechanisms, including oxidative stress, mitochondrial DNA mutations, DNA damage, telomere shortening, hormonal changes, and autophagy impairment, have been identified as involved in skin aging.

      "abstract": "Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a complex autoimmune inflammatory disorder with multiple organ involvement. Skin changes present the hallmark of SSc and coincide with poor prognosis. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are the most widely reported complications in SSc patients and the primary cause of death. It has been proposed that the processes of autophagy and apoptosis could play a significant role in the pathogenesis and clinical course of different autoimmune diseases, and accordingly in SSc. In this manuscript, we review the current knowledge of autophagy and apoptosis processes in the skin and lungs of patients with SSc. Profiling of markers involved in these processes in skin cells can be useful to recognize the stage of fibrosis and can be used in the clinical stratification of patients. Furthermore, the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying these processes enables the repurposing of already known drugs and the development of new biological therapeutics that aim to reverse fibrosis by promoting apoptosis and regulate autophagy in personalized treatment approach. In SSc-ILD patients, the molecular signature of the lung tissues of each patient could be a distinctive criterion in order to establish the correct lung pattern, which directly impacts the course and prognosis of the disease. In this case, resolving the role of tissue-specific markers, which could be detected in the circulation using sensitive molecular methods, would be an important step toward development of non-invasive diagnostic procedures that enable early and precise diagnosis and preventing the high mortality of this rare disease.",

      "abstract": "Hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are two manifestations of skin pigmentation diseases. Recent studies have shown that autophagy is involved in the development of skin pigmentation diseases. The melanosome is a lysosome-related organelle characterized by the production of melanin. The autophagosome-lysosome degradation pathway exhibits a characteristic cell renewal function. The functions of melanosomes and autophagosomes intersect and the vesicle transport pathway mediates both autophagosome and melanosome formation, which may involve different regulatory protein complexes. Current studies have revealed that several autophagy-related regulators of autophagosome formation are involved in melanosome formation and maturation and also regulate melanogenesis, and that melanosomes can be degraded via autophagy in melanocytes. Autophagy is also involved in regulating the living environment of melanocytes. Understanding the effects of autophagy on pigmentation may support our understanding of pigmentation diseases. This article reviews the relationship between autophagy and pigmentation in melanocytes.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by well-defined erythema and white scales, which affects approximately 2% of the worldwide population and causes long-term distress to patients. Therefore, development of safe and effective therapeutic drugs is imminent. Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process, degrades intracellular constituents to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. Numerous studies have revealed that autophagy is closely related to immune function, such as removal of intracellular bacteria, inflammatory cytokine secretion, antigen presentation, and lymphocyte development. Phytochemicals derived from natural plants are often used to treat psoriasis due to their unique therapeutic properties and favorable safety. So far, a mass of phytochemicals have been proven to be able to activate autophagy and thus alleviate psoriasis. This review aimed to provide directions for finding phytochemicals that target autophagy to treat psoriasis.",

      "abstract": "The epidermis of the skin and skin appendages, such as nails, hair and sebaceous glands, depend on a balance of cell proliferation and terminal differentiation in order to fulfill their functions at the interface of the body and the environment. The differentiation of epithelial cells of the skin, commonly referred to as keratinocytes, involves major remodeling processes that generate metabolically inactive cell remnants serving as building blocks of the epidermal stratum corneum, nail plates and hair shafts. Only sebaceous gland differentiation results in cell disintegration and holocrine secretion. A series of studies performed in the past decade have revealed that the lysosome-dependent intracellular degradation mechanism of autophagy is active during keratinocyte differentiation, and the blockade of autophagy significantly alters the properties of the differentiation products. Here, we present a model for the autophagy-mediated degradation of organelles and cytosolic proteins as an important contributor to cellular remodeling in keratinocyte differentiation. The roles of autophagy are discussed in comparison to alternative intracellular degradation mechanisms and in the context of programmed cell death as an integral end point of epithelial differentiation.",

      "abstract": "Aging is a multifactorial biological process involving chronic diseases that manifest from the molecular level to the systemic level. From its inception to 31 May 2022, this study searched the PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases to identify relevant research from 15,983 articles. Multiple approaches have been employed to combat aging, such as dietary restriction (DR), exercise, exchanging circulating factors, gene therapy, and anti-aging drugs. Among them, anti-aging drugs are advantageous in their ease of adherence and wide prevalence. Despite a shared functional output of aging alleviation, the current anti-aging drugs target different signal pathways that frequently cross-talk with each other. At present, six important signal pathways were identified as being critical in the aging process, including pathways for the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nutrient signal pathway, silent information regulator factor 2-related enzyme 1 (SIRT1), regulation of telomere length and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), and energy metabolism. These signal pathways could be targeted by many anti-aging drugs, with the corresponding representatives of rapamycin, metformin, acarbose, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD",

      "title": "Nutraceutical activation of Sirt1: a review.",
      "abstract": "The deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), activated by calorie restriction and fasting, exerts several complementary effects on cellular function that are favourable to healthspan; it is often thought of as an 'anti-aging' enzyme. Practical measures which might boost Sirt1 activity are therefore of considerable interest. A number of nutraceuticals have potential in this regard. Nutraceuticals reported to enhance Sirt1 synthesis or protein expression include ferulic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, urolithin A, melatonin, astaxanthin, carnosic acid and neochlorogenic acid. The half-life of Sirt1 protein can be enhanced with the natural nicotinamide catabolite N1-methylnicotinamide. The availability of Sirt1's obligate substrate NAD+ can be increased in several ways: nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can function as substrates for NAD+ synthesis; activators of AMP-activated kinase-such as berberine-can increase expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which is rate limiting for NAD+ synthesis; and nutraceutical quinones such as thymoquinone and pyrroloquinoline quinone can boost NAD+ by promoting oxidation of NADH. Induced ketosis-as via ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides-can increase NAD+ in the brain by lessening the reduction of NAD+ mediated by glycolysis. Post-translational modifications of Sirt1 by O-GlcNAcylation or sulfonation can increase its activity, suggesting that administration of glucosamine or of agents promoting hydrogen sulfide synthesis may aid Sirt1 activity. Although resveratrol has poor pharmacokinetics, it can bind to Sirt1 and activate it allosterically-as can so-called sirtuin-activating compound drugs. Since oxidative stress can reduce Sirt1 activity in multiple ways, effective antioxidant supplementation that blunts such stress may also help preserve Sirt1 activity in some circumstances. Combination nutraceutical regimens providing physiologically meaningful doses of several of these agents, capable of activating Sirt1 in complementary ways, may have considerable potential for health promotion. Such measures may also amplify the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in non-diabetic disorders, as these benefits appear to reflect upregulation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase activities.",

Aging can be delayed and life-span and health-span can be extended by calorie and dietary restrictions, administration of NAM, NMN, NR, NAD+, and by antioxidants including hydrogen sulfide. Additional measures for the age related decline in tissue homeostasis include senotherapeutics, senolytics, senomorphics, anti-inflammaging strategies, reactivation of telomerase and prevention of stem cell exhaustion. There is also a possibility to erase the signs of aging and even to reverse aging by epigenetic reprogramming and other emerging measures.",

      "abstract": "Selective degradation of damaged mitochondria by autophagy (mitophagy) is proposed to play an important role in cellular homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms and the requirement of mitochondrial quality control by mitophagy for cellular physiology are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that primary human cells maintain highly active basal mitophagy initiated by mitochondrial superoxide signaling. Mitophagy was found to be mediated by PINK1/Parkin-dependent pathway involving p62 as a selective autophagy receptor (SAR). Importantly, this pathway was suppressed upon the induction of cellular senescence and in naturally aged cells, leading to a robust shutdown of mitophagy. Inhibition of mitophagy in proliferating cells was sufficient to trigger the senescence program, while reactivation of mitophagy was necessary for the anti-senescence effects of NAD precursors or rapamycin. Furthermore, reactivation of mitophagy by a p62-targeting small molecule rescued markers of cellular aging, which establishes mitochondrial quality control as a promising target for anti-aging interventions.",

      "abstract": "The risk of morbidity and mortality increases exponentially with age. Chronic inflammation, accumulation of DNA damage, dysfunctional mitochondria, and increased senescent cell load are factors contributing to this. Mechanistic investigations have revealed specific pathways and processes which, proposedly, cause age-related phenotypes such as frailty, reduced physical resilience, and multi-morbidity. Among promising treatments alleviating the consequences of aging are caloric restriction and pharmacologically targeting longevity pathways such as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), sirtuins, and anti-apoptotic pathways in senescent cells. Regulation of these pathways and processes has revealed significant health- and lifespan extending results in animal models. Nevertheless, it remains unclear if similar results translate to humans. A requirement of translation are the development of age- and morbidity associated biomarkers as longitudinal trials are difficult and not feasible, practical, nor ethical when human life span is the endpoint. Current biomarkers and the results of anti-aging intervention studies in humans will be covered within this paper. The future of clinical trials targeting aging may be phase 2 and 3 studies with larger populations if safety and tolerability of investigated medication continues not to be a hurdle for further investigations.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or Nicotinamide-1-ium-1-β-D-ribofuranoside 5'-phosphate is a nucleotide that can be converted into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in human cells. NMN has recently attracted great attention because of its potential as an anti-aging drug, leading to great efforts for its effective manufacture. The chemical synthesis of NMN is a challenging task since it is an isomeric compound with a complicated structure. The majority of biological synthetic routes for NMN is through the intermediate phosphoribosyl diphosphate (PRPP), which is further converted to NMN by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt). There are various routes for the synthesis of PRPP from simple starting materials such as ribose, adenosine, and xylose, but all of these require the expensive phosphate donor adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Thus, an ATP regeneration system can be included, leading to diminished ATP consumption during the catalytic process. The regulations of enzymes that are not directly involved in the synthesis of NMN are also critical for the production of NMN. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the biological production of NMN with respect to the critical enzymes, reaction conditions, and productivity.",

      "abstract": "Renal failure is a major health problem that is increasing worldwide. To improve clinical outcomes, we need to understand the basic mechanisms of kidney disease. Aging is a risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease. Cells develop an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants as they age, resulting in oxidative stress and the development of kidney damage. Calorie restriction (CR) is recognized as a dietary approach that promotes longevity, reduces oxidative stress, and delays the onset of age-related diseases. Sirtuins, a type of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent histone deacetylase, are considered to be anti-aging molecules, and CR induces their expression. The sirtuin family consists of seven enzymes (Sirt1-7) that are involved in processes and functions related to antioxidant and oxidative stress, such as DNA damage repair and metabolism through histone and protein deacetylation. In fact, a role for sirtuins in the regulation of antioxidants and redox substances has been suggested. Therefore, the activation of sirtuins in the kidney may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to enhancing resistance to many causative factors in kidney disease through the reduction of oxidative stress. In this review, we discuss the relationship between sirtuins and oxidative stress in renal disease.",

      "abstract": "There have been many discussions on longevity from ancient times to the present day. In the Laozi, it is said, \"Heaven and earth are long and enduring because they do not arise from themselves, so they can live forever.\" In Zhuangzi - Zai You, it is also said, \"Keep your mental peace, and your body will be healthy. Don't strain your body and don't consume your spirit to live a long life.\" It is clear that people attach importance to anti-aging and the desire for longevity. Throughout human history, we have treated aging as an inevitable process, but with the development of medical science, we have become more aware of the various molecular changes in the human body. In an aging society, more people are suffering from age-related diseases such as osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease, which has led to a search for anti-aging. However, by 'living longer' we mean not only living but also living longer in good health. The mechanisms of aging are still unclear and there is a great deal of interest and curiosity in how to combat aging effectively. Some potential criteria exist for the determination of anti-aging drugs: the first criterion is the ability to exert life-extending effects in model organisms, preferably in mammals; the second criterion is the ability to prevent or delay several age-related diseases in mammals; and the third criterion is the ability to inhibit the transition of cells from a quiescent to a senescent state. Based on these criteria, the current anti-aging drugs often involved are rapamycin, metformin, curcumin and other polyphenols, polysaccharides, resveratrol, etc. The most studied and relatively well-understood pathways and factors of aging are currently known to include seven enzymes, six biological factors, and one chemical, which mainly involve more than ten pathways such as Nrf2/SKN-1; NFκB; AMPK; P13K/AKT; IGF; and NAD.",

      "abstract": "Heart aging is the main susceptible factor to coronary heart disease and significantly increases the risk of heart failure, especially when the aging heart is suffering from ischemia-reperfusion injury. Numerous studies with NAD+ supplementations have suggested its use in anti-aging treatment. However, systematic reviews regarding the overall role of NAD+ in cardiac aging are scarce. The relationship between NAD+ signaling and heart aging has yet to be clarified. This review comprehensively summarizes the current studies on the role of NAD+ signaling in delaying heart aging from the following aspects: the influence of NAD+ supplementations on the aging heart; the relationship and cross-talks between NAD+ signaling and other cardiac aging-related signaling pathways; Importantly, the therapeutic potential of targeting NAD+ in delaying heart aging will be discussed. In brief, NAD+ plays a vital role in delaying heart aging. However, the abnormalities such as altered glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and calcium overload could also interfere with NAD+ function in the heart. Therefore, the specific physiopathology of the aging heart should be considered before applying NAD+ supplementations. We believe that this article will help augment our understanding of heart aging mechanisms. In the meantime, it provides invaluable insights into possible therapeutic strategies for preventing age-related heart diseases in clinical settings.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenia, an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is increasingly recognized as a significant condition in the aging population, particularly among those with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the interplay between sarcopenia and cardiogeriatrics, emphasizing shared mechanisms such as chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging), hormonal dysregulation, oxidative stress, and physical inactivity. Despite advancements in diagnostic frameworks, such as the EWGSOP2 and AWGS definitions, variability in criteria and assessment methods continues to challenge standardization. Key diagnostic tools include dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioimpedance analysis (BIA) for muscle mass, alongside functional measures such as grip strength and gait speed. The review highlights the bidirectional relationship between sarcopenia and cardiovascular conditions such as heart failure, aortic stenosis, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which exacerbate each other through complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the mTOR pathway, NAD+ metabolism, and senescence-related processes offer promise in mitigating sarcopenia's progression. Additionally, integrated interventions combining resistance training, nutritional optimization, and novel anti-aging therapies hold significant potential for improving outcomes. This paper underscores critical gaps in the evidence, including the need for longitudinal studies to establish causality and the validation of advanced therapeutic approaches in clinical settings. Future research should leverage multi-omics technologies and machine learning to identify biomarkers and personalize interventions. Addressing these challenges is essential to reducing sarcopenia's burden and enhancing the quality of life for elderly individuals with comorbid cardiovascular conditions. This synthesis aims to guide future research and promote effective, individualized management strategies.",

NMN significantly improves recovery from aging-related diseases, such as diminished heart function, reduced fertility, memory decline, and diabetes. NMN demonstrates both efficacy and safety in anti-aging. The use of NMN in China has gradually gained acceptance, highlighting the importance of exploring the mechanism of NMN in anti-aging effects and improving the biosynthesis of NMN. In addition, NMN in combination with stem cells hold promise in the treatment of aging-related degenerative diseases and promote overall human and animal health.",

The goal of this study is to unravel the complex interactions among aging, metabolism, and the circadian clock. We seek to identify key factors that inform the liver circadian clock of cellular energy status and to reveal the mechanisms by which variations in food intake may disrupt the clock. To address these questions, we develop a comprehensive mathematical model that represents the circadian pathway in the mouse liver, together with the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, mTORC1, AMPK, NAD+, and the NAD+ -consuming factor SIRT1. The model is age-specific and can simulate the liver of a young mouse or an aged mouse. Simulation results suggest that the reduced NAD+ and SIRT1 bioavailability may explain the shortened circadian period in aged rodents. Importantly, the model identifies the dosing schedules for maximizing the efficacy of anti-aging medications.",

      "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable biological process and is accompanied by a gradual decline of physiological functions, such as the incidence of age-related diseases. Aging becomes a major burden and challenge for society to prevent or delay the occurrence and development of these age-related diseases. AMPK is a key regulator of intracellular energy and participates in the adaptation of calorie restriction. It is also an important mediator of nutritionally sensitive pathways that regulate the biological effects of nutrient active ingredients. AMPK can limit proliferation and activate autophagy. Recent studies have shown that nutritional intervention can delay aging and lessen age-related diseases in many animal and even human models. Polyphenols function as a natural antidote and are important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents in human diets. Polyphenols can prevent age-related diseases because they regulate complex networks of cellular processes such as oxidative damage, inflammation, cellular aging, and autophagy, and have also attracted wide attention as a potential beneficial substance for longevity. In this review, we systemically summarized the progress of targeting AMPK signaling by dietary polyphenols in aging prevention. Polyphenols can reduce oxidative stress and inflammatory response, and maintain the steady state of energy. Polyphenols can also modulate sirtuins/NAD+, nutrient-sensing, proteostasis, mitochondrial function, autophagy and senescence ",

      "title": "Recent Advances in Anti-Aging Therapeutic Strategies Targeting DNA Damage Response and Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype-Linked Signaling Cascade.",
      "abstract": "Aging is considered the contributory accumulation of abruptions occurring through cell signaling cascades, which ultimately cause changes in physical functions, cell fate, and damage across all organ systems. DNA damage response (DDR) also occurs through telomere shortening, tumor formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and so forth. Cellular aging occurs through cell cycle arrest, which is the result of extended DDR cascade signaling networks via MDC1, 53BP1, H2AX, ATM, ARF, P53, P13-Akt, BRAF, Sirtuins, NAD + , and so forth. These persistent cell cycle arrests initiated by DDR and other associated stress-induced signals promote a permanent state of cell cycle arrest called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, cellular aging gets accelerated with faulty DNA repair systems, and the produced senescent cells further generate various promoting contributors to age-related dysfunctional diseases including SASP. Any changes to these factors contribute to age-related disease development. Therefore, this review explores anti-aging factors targeting DDR and SASP regulation and their detailed signaling networks. In addition, it allows researchers to identify anti-aging targets and anti-aging therapeutic strategies based on identified and nonidentified targets.",

      "abstract": "The mitochondrial-rich renal tubule cells are key regulators of blood homeostasis via excretion and reabsorption of metabolic waste. With age, tubules are subject to increasing mitochondrial dysfunction and declining nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, both hampering ATP production efficiency. We tested two mitochondrial interventions in young (6-mo) and aged (26-mo) adult male mice: elamipretide (ELAM), a tetrapeptide in clinical trials that improves mitochondrial structure and function, and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), an NAD+ intermediate and commercially available oral supplement. Kidneys were analyzed from young and aged mice after eight weeks of treatment with ELAM (3 mg/kg/day), NMN (300 mg/kg/day), or from aged mice treated with the two interventions combined (ELAM+NMN). We hypothesized that combining pharmacologic treatments to ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction and boost NAD+ levels, would more effectively reduce kidney aging than either intervention alone. Unexpectedly, in aged kidneys, NMN increased expression of genetic markers of inflammation (IL-1-beta; and Ccl2) and tubule injury (Kim-1). Metabolomics of endpoint sera showed that NMN-treated aged mice had higher circulating levels of uremic toxins than either aged controls or young NMN-treated mice. ELAM+NMN-treated aged mice accumulated uremic toxins like NMN-only aged mice, but reduced IL-1-beta; and Ccl2 kidney mRNA. This suggests that pre-existing mitochondrial dysfunction in aged kidney underlies susceptibility to inflammatory signaling with NMN supplementation in aged, but not young, mice. These findings demonstrate age and tissue dependent effects on downstream metabolic accumulation from NMN and highlight the need for targeted analysis of aged kidneys to assess the safety of anti-aging supplements in older populations.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide (NAM), the amide form of vitamin B3, is a precursor to essential cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) and NADPH. NAD⁺ is integral to numerous cellular processes, including metabolism regulation, ATP production, mitochondrial respiration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) management, DNA repair, cellular senescence, and aging. NAM supplementation has demonstrated efficacy in restoring cellular energy, repairing DNA damage, and inhibiting inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Due to its natural presence in a variety of foods and its excellent safety profile-even at high doses of up to 3 g/day-NAM is extensively used in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancers and the treatment of dermatological conditions such as blistering diseases, atopic dermatitis, rosacea, and acne vulgaris. Recently, its anti-aging properties have elevated NAM's prominence in skincare formulations. Beyond DNA repair and energy replenishment, NAM significantly impacts oxidative stress reduction, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis modulation. Despite these multifaceted benefits, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms underlying NAM's actions remain not fully elucidated. This review consolidates recent research to shed light on these mechanisms, emphasizing the critical role of NAM in cellular health and its therapeutic potential. By enhancing our understanding, this work underscores the importance of continued exploration into NAM's applications, aiming to inform future clinical practices and skincare innovations.",

      "title": "Regular exercise effectively protects against the aging-associated decline in skeletal muscle NAD content.",
      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a tissue integral to general health. Due to its high abundance and oxidative capacity, its metabolism is intimately linked to whole-body physiology. In the elderly population, mobility correlates positively with life expectancy and survival. Furthermore, regular physical activity is one of the most effective health-promoting interventions that delay the onset of aging-associated chronic diseases. Data from preclinical studies show that aging of various tissues is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), which plays a central role in energy homeostasis. Thus, a hypothesis has emerged that normalization of its content would ameliorate the age-related decline in tissue function and therefore improve health of the elderly. This idea, along with the documented safety and high tolerability of NAD precursor supplementation, makes NAD metabolism a prospective target for anti-aging interventions. Interestingly, muscle NAD biosynthesis pathways are stimulated by exercise training, which suggests that training-induced adaptations rely on tissue NAD levels. However, while the relationship between muscle fitness and regular physical activity is well-characterized, the proposed synergy between muscle NAD replenishment and exercise training has not been established. Here, we review the published data on the role of NAD metabolism in exercise in the context of young and aged skeletal muscle and discuss the current challenges relevant to the field.",

      "title": "PDRN prevents SIRT1 degradation by attenuating autophagy during skin aging.",
      "abstract": "Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) is a low molecular weight linear polyribonucleotide fragment derived from salmon sperm, known for its potential in tissue regeneration and anti-inflammatory applications. However, its specific function in cellular senescence is yet to be fully understood. Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), an NAD + -dependent deacetylase, plays a crucial role in regulating cellular aging and tumorigenesis. Notably, SIRT1 levels decrease with age in both mice and during cellular senescence, highlighting its significance in anti-aging processes. This study assessed the effects of PDRN on cellular aging induced by ultraviolet B (UVB) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and investigated the mechanisms of its protective effects against aging at the cellular level. Our data demonstrated that PDRN treatment mitigated the decline in cell viability and inhibited cell aging when exposed to UVB or H2O2. Furthermore, PDRN ameliorated UVB-induced epidermal thickening in mouse skin. Mechanically, we found that PDRN treatment led to a reduction in nuclear autophagy and the formation of cytoplasmic stress granules by preventing the accumulation of damaged LC3 in the nuclear and inhibiting the degradation of SIRT1 and p62 in the cytoplasm during cellular senescence. In conclusion, PDRN exhibits antioxidant and anti-aging properties by diminishing autophagy and enhancing SIRT1 expression. These results suggest that PDRN has potential as a therapeutic compound for reducing skin aging induced by UVB or H2O2 through the modulation of SIRT1 levels.",

      "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in energy metabolism. Because decreasing NAD levels is a common hallmark of the aging process in various tissues and organs, maintaining NAD levels has recently been of interest for the prevention of aging and age-related diseases. Although placental extract (PE) are known to possess several anti-aging effects, the NAD-boosting activity of PE remains unknown. In this study, we found that porcine PE (PPE) significantly increased intracellular NAD levels in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs). PPE also attenuated the NAD depletion induced by FK866, an inhibitor of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Interestingly, only the fraction containing nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), nicotinamide riboside (NR), and nicotinamide (NAM) restored NAD content in NHEKs in the absence of NAMPT activity. These results suggest that PPE increases intracellular NAD by providing NAD precursors such as NMN, NR, and NAM. Finally, we showed that the application of PPE to the stratum corneum of the reconstructed human epidermis significantly ameliorated FK866-induced NAD depletion, suggesting that topical PPE may be helpful for increasing skin NAD levels. This is the first study to report the novel biological activity of PE as an NAD booster in human epidermal cells.",

      "abstract": "SIRT3 is a protein lysine deacetylase with a prominent role in the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity, which is a vulnerable target in many diseases. Intriguingly, cellular aging is reversible just by SIRT3 overexpression, which raises many questions about the role of SIRT3 in the molecular anti-aging mechanisms. Therefore, functions of SIRT3 were analyzed through the interaction network of 407 substrates collected by data mining. Results of the pathway enrichment and gene function prediction confirmed functions in the primary metabolism and mitochondrial ATP production. However, it also suggested involvement in thermogenesis, brain-related neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's, Huntington's disease (HD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The protein node prioritization analysis identified subunits of the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) as the nodes with the main regulatory effect within the entire interaction network. Additional high-ranked nodes were succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB), complex II, and ATP5F1, complex V of MRC. The analysis supports existence of the NADH/NAD+ driven regulatory feedback loop between SIRT3, complex I (MRC), and acetyl-CoA synthetases, and existence of the nuclear substrates of SIRT3. Unexplored functions of SIRT3 substrates such as LMNA and LMNB; HIF-1a, p53, DNA-PK, and PARK7 are highlighted for further scientific advances. SIRT3 acts as a repressor of BACE1 through the SIRT3-LKB1-AMPK-CREB-PGC1A-PPARG-BACE1 (SIRT3-BACE1), which functions are fitted the best by the Circadian Clock pathway. It forms a new working hypothesis as the therapeutical target for AD treatment. Other important pathways linked to SIRT3 activity are highlighted for therapeutical interventions.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are believed to have originated through an ancient endosymbiotic process in which proteobacteria were captured and co-opted for energy production and cellular metabolism. Mitochondria segregate during cell division and differentiation, with vertical inheritance of mitochondria and the mitochondrial DNA genome from parent to daughter cells. However, an emerging body of literature indicates that some cell types export their mitochondria for delivery to developmentally unrelated cell types, a process called intercellular mitochondria transfer. In this Review, we describe the mechanisms by which mitochondria are transferred between cells and discuss how intercellular mitochondria transfer regulates the physiology and function of various organ systems in health and disease. In particular, we discuss the role of mitochondria transfer in regulating cellular metabolism, cancer, the immune system, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, mitochondrial quality control, wound healing and adipose tissue function. We also highlight the potential of targeting intercellular mitochondria transfer as a therapeutic strategy to treat human diseases and augment cellular therapies.",

Given their multifunctional and malleable nature, the frequently used terms 'mitochondrial function' and 'mitochondrial dysfunction' are misleading misnomers that fail to capture the complexity of mitochondrial biology. To increase the conceptual and experimental specificity in mitochondrial science, we propose a terminology system that distinguishes between (1) cell-dependent properties, (2) molecular features, (3) activities, (4) functions and (5) behaviours. A hierarchical terminology system that accurately captures the multifaceted nature of mitochondria will achieve three important outcomes. It will convey a more holistic picture of mitochondria as we teach the next generations of mitochondrial biologists, maximize progress in the rapidly expanding field of mitochondrial science, and also facilitate synergy with other disciplines. Improving specificity in the language around mitochondrial science is a step towards refining our understanding of the mechanisms by which this unique family of organelles contributes to cellular and organismal health.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles with multiple functions. They participate in necrotic cell death and programmed apoptotic, and are crucial for cell metabolism and survival. Mitophagy serves as a cytoprotective mechanism to remove superfluous or dysfunctional mitochondria and maintain mitochondrial fine-tuning numbers to balance intracellular homeostasis. Growing evidences show that mitophagy, as an acute tissue stress response, plays an important role in maintaining the health of the mitochondrial network. Since the timely removal of abnormal mitochondria is essential for cell survival, cells have evolved a variety of mitophagy pathways to ensure that mitophagy can be activated in time under various environments. A better understanding of the mechanism of mitophagy in various diseases is crucial for the treatment of diseases and therapeutic target design. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy-mediated mitochondrial elimination, how mitophagy maintains mitochondrial homeostasis at the system levels and organ, and what alterations in mitophagy are related to the development of diseases, including neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal disease, etc., in recent advances. Finally, we summarize the potential clinical applications and outline the conditions for mitophagy regulators to enter clinical trials. Research advances in signaling transduction of mitophagy will have an important role in developing new therapeutic strategies for precision medicine.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction severely affects cell fitness and contributes to disease. Proper organellar function depends on the biogenesis and maintenance of mitochondria and its >1,000 proteins. As a result, the cell has evolved mechanisms to coordinate protein and organellar quality control, such as the turnover of proteins via mitochondria-associated degradation, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and mitoproteases, as well as the elimination of mitochondria through mitophagy. Specific quality control mechanisms are engaged depending upon the nature and severity of mitochondrial dysfunction, which can also feed back to elicit transcriptional or proteomic remodeling by the cell.

      "abstract": "In animals, mitochondria are mainly organised into an interconnected tubular network extending across the cell along a cytoskeletal scaffold. Mitochondrial fission and fusion, as well as distribution along cytoskeletal tracks, are counterbalancing mechanisms acting in concert to maintain a mitochondrial network tuned to cellular function. Balanced mitochondrial dynamics permits quality control of the network including biogenesis and turnover, and distribution of mitochondrial DNA, and is linked to metabolic status. Cellular and organismal health relies on a delicate balance between fission and fusion, and large rearrangements in the mitochondrial network can be seen in response to cellular insults and disease. Indeed, dysfunction in the major components of the fission and fusion machineries including dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), mitofusins 1 and 2 (MFN1, MFN2) and optic atrophy protein 1 (OPA1) and ensuing imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics can lead to neurodegenerative disease. Altered mitochondrial dynamics is also seen in more common diseases. In this review, the machinery involved in mitochondrial dynamics and their dysfunction in disease will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Popular media has recently positioned Zone 2 training-defined as low-intensity exercise below the lactate threshold-as the optimal intensity for improving mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidative capacity, thereby supporting cardiometabolic health and chronic disease prevention. These recommendations largely stem from observational data of elite endurance athletes who engage in large volumes of Zone 2 training and possess high mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidative capacity. However, we challenge the broad endorsement of Zone 2 training for members of the general public, as it contradicts substantial evidence supporting the use of high-intensity exercise for improving mitochondrial capacity and cardiometabolic health. This narrative review critically examines the current evidence on Zone 2 training and mitochondrial and fatty acid oxidative capacity outcomes to assess the appropriateness for a public recommendation. We conclude that current evidence does not support Zone 2 training as the optimal intensity for improving mitochondrial or fatty acid oxidative capacity. Further, evidence suggests prioritizing higher exercise intensities (> Zone 2) is critical to maximize cardiometabolic health benefits, particularly in the context of lower training volumes.",

They are also at the center of the proinflammatory response and have essential roles in the response against pathogenic infections. Mitochondria are a major site for production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS; or free radicals), which are essential to fight infection. However, excessive and uncontrolled production can become deleterious to the cell, leading to mitochondrial and tissue damage. Pathogens exploit the role of mitochondria during infection by affecting the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism (OXPHOS), mitochondrial network and disrupting the communication between the nucleus and the mitochondria. The role of mitochondria in these biological processes makes these organelle good targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. In this review, we presented a summary of the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria and their involvement in the pathogen response, as well as the potential promising mitochondrial targets for the fight against infectious diseases and chronic inflammatory diseases.",

      "abstract": "After a century, it's time to turn the page on understanding of lactate metabolism and appreciate that lactate shuttling is an important component of intermediary metabolism in vivo. Cell-cell and intracellular lactate shuttles fulfil purposes of energy substrate production and distribution, as well as cell signalling under fully aerobic conditions. Recognition of lactate shuttling came first in studies of physical exercise where the roles of driver (producer) and recipient (consumer) cells and tissues were obvious. Moreover, the presence of lactate shuttling as part of postprandial glucose disposal and satiety signalling has been recognized. Mitochondrial respiration creates the physiological sink for lactate disposal in vivo. Repeated lactate exposure from regular exercise results in adaptive processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis and other healthful circulatory and neurological characteristics such as improved physical work capacity, metabolic flexibility, learning, and memory. The importance of lactate and lactate shuttling in healthful living is further emphasized when lactate signalling and shuttling are dysregulated as occurs in particular illnesses and injuries. Like a phoenix, lactate has risen to major importance in 21st century biology.",

      "abstract": "The biguanide metformin is the most commonly used antidiabetic drug. Recent studies show that metformin not only improves chronic inflammation by improving metabolic parameters but also has a direct anti-inflammatory effect. In light of these findings, it is essential to identify the inflammatory pathways targeted by metformin to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of this drug. Commonly accepted mechanisms of metformin action include AMPK activation and inhibition of mTOR pathways, which are evaluated in multiple diseases. Additionally, metformin's action on mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis processes such as autophagy is of particular interest because of the importance of these mechanisms in maintaining cellular health. Both dysregulated mitochondria and failure of the autophagy pathways, the latter of which impair clearance of dysfunctional, damaged, or excess organelles, affect cellular health drastically and can trigger the onset of metabolic and age-related diseases. Immune cells are the fundamental cell types that govern the health of an organism. Thus, dysregulation of autophagy or mitochondrial function in immune cells has a remarkable effect on susceptibility to infections, response to vaccination, tumor onset, and the development of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. In this study, we summarize the latest research on metformin's regulation of immune cell mitochondrial function and autophagy as evidence that new clinical trials on metformin with primary outcomes related to the immune system should be considered to treat immune-mediated diseases over the near term.",

It is now appreciated that mitochondrial fission also represents an end-point event in a signalling axis that allows cells to sense and respond to external cues. The fission process is orchestrated by membrane-associated adaptors, influenced by organellar and cytoskeletal interactions and ultimately executed by the dynamin-like GTPase DRP1. Here we invoke the framework of the 'mitochondrial divisome', which is conceptually and operationally similar to the bacterial cell-division machinery. We review the functional and regulatory aspects of the mitochondrial divisome and, within this framework, parse the core from the accessory machinery. In so doing, we transition from a phenomenological to a mechanistic understanding of the fission process.",

      "abstract": "One of the main functions of mitochondria is production of ATP for cellular energy needs, however, it becomes more recognized that mitochondria are involved in differentiation and activation processes of immune cells. Upon activation, immune cells have a high need for energy. Immune cells have different strategies to generate this energy. In pro-inflammatory cells, such as activated monocytes and activated T and B cells, the energy is generated by increasing glycolysis, while in regulatory cells, such as regulatory T cells or M2 macrophages, energy is generated by increasing mitochondrial function and beta-oxidation. Except for being important for energy supply during activation, mitochondria also induce immune responses. During an infection, they release mitochondrial danger associated molecules (DAMPs) that resemble structures of bacterial derived pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Such mitochondrial DAMPS are for instance mitochondrial DNA with hypomethylated CpG motifs or a specific lipid that is only present in prokaryotic bacteria and mitochondria, i.e. cardiolipin. Via release of such DAMPs, mitochondria guide the immune response towards an inflammatory response against pathogens. This is an important mechanism in early detection of an infection and in stimulating and sustaining immune responses to fight infections. However, mitochondrial DAMPs may also have a negative impact. If mitochondrial DAMPs are released by damaged cells, without the presence of an infection, such as after a trauma, mitochondrial DAMPs may induce an undesired inflammatory response, resulting in tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Thus, immune cells have developed mechanisms to prevent such undesired immune activation by mitochondrial components. In the present narrative review, we will describe the current view of mitochondria in regulation of immune responses. We will also discuss the current knowledge on disturbed mitochondrial function in immune cells in various immunological diseases.",

Large-scale deletions span kilobases in length and the loss of these associated genes contributes to crippled oxidative phosphorylation and overall decline in mitochondrial fitness. There is not a united view for how mtDNA deletions are generated and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. This review discusses the role of replication and repair in mtDNA deletion formation as well as nucleic acid motifs such as repeats, secondary structures, and DNA damage associated with deletion formation in the mitochondrial genome. We propose that while erroneous replication and repair can separately contribute to deletion formation, crosstalk between these pathways is also involved in generating deletions.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondrial dynamics, including fission and fusion processes, are essential for heart health. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, maintain their integrity through continuous cycles of biogenesis, fission, fusion, and degradation. Mitochondria are relatively immobile in the adult heart, but their morphological changes due to mitochondrial morphology factors are critical for cellular functions such as energy production, organelle integrity, and stress response. Mitochondrial fusion proteins, particularly Mfn1/2 and Opa1, play multiple roles beyond their pro-fusion effects, such as endoplasmic reticulum tethering, mitophagy, cristae remodeling, and apoptosis regulation. On the other hand, the fission process, regulated by proteins such as Drp1, Fis1, Mff and MiD49/51, is essential to eliminate damaged mitochondria via mitophagy and to ensure proper cell division. In the cardiac system, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and various cardiac diseases, including metabolic and inherited cardiomyopathies. In addition, mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress has been implicated in atherosclerosis, hypertension and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, understanding and regulating mitochondrial dynamics is a promising therapeutic tool in cardiac diseases. This review summarizes the role of mitochondrial morphology in heart diseases for each mitochondrial morphology regulatory gene, and their potential as therapeutic targets to heart diseases.",

A 15 min exposure to 670 nm light reduced the degree of blood glucose elevation following glucose intake by 27.7%, integrated over 2 h after the glucose challenge.

In this review, we will try to summarize the current knowledge on MAMs' structure and functions in health and their relevance for human diseases.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria sense both biochemical and energetic input in addition to communicating signals regarding the energetic state of the cell. Increasingly, these signaling organelles are recognized as key for regulating different cell functions. This review summarizes recent advances in mitochondrial communication in striated muscle, with specific focus on the processes by which mitochondria communicate with each other, other organelles, and across distant organ systems. Intermitochondrial communication in striated muscle is mediated via conduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential to adjacent mitochondria, physical interactions, mitochondrial fusion or fission, and via nanotunnels, allowing for the exchange of proteins, mitochondrial DNA, nucleotides, and peptides. Within striated muscle cells, mitochondria-organelle communication can modulate overall cell function. The various mechanisms by which mitochondria communicate mitochondrial fitness to the rest of the body suggest that extracellular mitochondrial signaling is key during health and disease. Whereas mitochondria-derived vesicles might excrete mitochondria-derived endocrine compounds, stimulation of mitochondrial stress can lead to the release of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) into the circulation to modulate whole-body physiology. Circulating mitochondrial DNA are well-known alarmins that trigger the immune system and may help to explain low-grade inflammation in various chronic diseases. Impaired mitochondrial function and communication are central in common heart and skeletal muscle pathologies, including cardiomyopathies, insulin resistance, and sarcopenia. Lastly, important new advances in research in mitochondrial endocrinology, communication, medical horizons, and translational aspects are discussed.",

At the molecular level, mitochondria can sense imbalances in their homeostasis and adapt to these by signaling to the nucleus. This mito-nuclear communication leads to the expression of nuclear stress response genes. Upon external stimuli, mitochondria can also alter their morphology accordingly, by inducing fission or fusion. In an extreme situation, mitochondria are degraded by mitophagy.

      "abstract": "Mitophagy, a specialised form of autophagy, selectively targeting damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria, and is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and mitochondrial quality control. Dysregulation of mitophagy contributes to various pathological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of the molecular mechanisms, regulatory pathways, and interplay with other cellular processes governing mitophagy, emphasizing its importance in physiological and pathological contexts. We explore the PINK1/Parkin-mediated and receptor-mediated mitophagy pathways, encompassing BNIP3/NIX, FUNDC1, and Bcl2-L-13. Additionally, we discuss post-translational modifications and cellular signalling pathways modulating mitophagy, as well as the connection between mitophagy and ageing, highlighting the decline in mitophagy efficiency and its impact on age-related pathologies. The review also investigates mitophagy's role in human diseases such as cancer, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease. We assess the potential of mitophagy-targeting therapeutic strategies, focusing on the development of dietary therapies, small molecules, drugs, and gene therapy approaches that modulate mitophagy levels and efficiency for treating these diseases and dysfunctions commonly observed in ageing individuals. In summary, this review offers an extensive overview of the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks involved in mitophagy, its association with autophagy, and implications in human health and disease. By examining the potential of mitophagy-modulating therapies in disease and non-disease settings, we aim to inspire further research to develop innovative treatment strategies for various pathological conditions linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and to ageing.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria control cellular functions through their metabolic role. Recent research that has gained considerable attention is their ability to transfer between cells. This has the potential of improving cellular functions in pathological or energy-deficit conditions, but little is known about the role of mitochondrial transfer in sustaining cellular homeostasis. Few studies have investigated the potential of skeletal muscle as a source of healthy mitochondria that can be transferred to other cell types. Thus, we isolated intermyofibrillar mitochondria from murine skeletal muscle and incubated them with host cells. We observed dose- and time-dependent increases in mitochondrial incorporation into myoblasts. This resulted in elongated mitochondrial networks and an enhancement of bioenergetic profile of the host cells. Mitochondrial donation also rejuvenated the functional capacities of the myoblasts when respiration efficiency and lysosomal function were inhibited by complex I inhibitor rotenone and bafilomycin A, respectively. Mitochondrial transfer was accomplished via tunneling nanotubes, extracellular vesicles, gap junctions, and by macropinocytosis internalization. Murine muscle mitochondria were also effectively transferred to human fibroblast cells having mitochondrial DNA mutations, resulting in augmented mitochondrial dynamics and metabolic functions. This improved cell function by diminishing reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission in the diseased cells. Our findings suggest that mitochondria from donor skeletal muscle can be integrated in both healthy and functionally compromised host cells leading to mitochondrial structural refinement and respiratory boost. This mitochondrial trafficking and bioenergetic reprogramming to maintain and revitalize tissue homeostasis could be a useful therapeutic strategy in treating diseases.",

      "abstract": "The pursuit of enhanced health during aging has prompted the exploration of various strategies focused on reducing the decline associated with the aging process. A key area of this exploration is the management of mitochondrial dysfunction, a notable characteristic of aging. This review sheds light on the crucial role that small molecules play in augmenting healthy aging, particularly through influencing mitochondrial functions. Mitochondrial oxidative damage, a significant aspect of aging, can potentially be lessened through interventions such as coenzyme Q10, alpha-lipoic acid, and a variety of antioxidants. Additionally, this review discusses approaches for enhancing mitochondrial proteostasis, emphasizing the importance of mitochondrial unfolded protein response inducers like doxycycline, and agents that affect mitophagy, such as urolithin A, spermidine, trehalose, and taurine, which are vital for sustaining protein quality control. Of equal importance are methods for modulating mitochondrial energy production, which involve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide boosters, adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase activators, and compounds like metformin and mitochondria-targeted tamoxifen that enhance metabolic function. Furthermore, the review delves into emerging strategies that encourage mitochondrial biogenesis. Together, these interventions present a promising avenue for addressing age-related mitochondrial degradation, thereby setting the stage for the development of innovative treatment approaches to meet this extensive challenge.",

      "abstract": "Disruption of mitochondrial function is observed in multiple drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs), a significant global health threat. However, how the mitochondrial dysfunction occurs and whether maintain mitochondrial homeostasis is beneficial for DILIs remains unclear. Here, we show that defective mitophagy by OPTN (optineurin) ablation causes disrupted mitochondrial homeostasis and aggravates hepatocytes necrosis in DILIs, while OPTN overexpression protects against DILI depending on its mitophagic function. Notably, mass spectrometry analysis identifies a new mitochondrial substrate, GCDH (glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase), which can be selectively recruited by OPTN for mitophagic degradation, and a new cofactor, VCP (valosin containing protein) that interacts with OPTN to stabilize BECN1 during phagophore assembly, thus boosting OPTN-mediated mitophagy initiation to clear damaged mitochondria and preserve mitochondrial homeostasis in DILIs. Then, the accumulation of OPTN in different DILIs is further validated with a protective effect, and pyridoxine is screened and established to alleviate DILIs by inducing OPTN-mediated mitophagy. Collectively, our findings uncover a dual role of OPTN in mitophagy initiation and implicate the preservation of mitochondrial homeostasis via inducing OPTN-mediated mitophagy as a potential therapeutic approach for DILIs.",

This process has diverse functions depending on the cell types involved and physiological or disease context. Although mitochondria transfer was first shown to provide metabolic support to acceptor cells, recent studies have revealed diverse functions of mitochondria transfer, including, but not limited to, the maintenance of mitochondria quality of the donor cell and the regulation of tissue homeostasis and remodelling. Many mitochondria-transfer mechanisms have been described using a variety of names, generating confusion about mitochondria transfer biology. Furthermore, several therapeutic approaches involving mitochondria-transfer biology have emerged, including mitochondria transplantation and cellular engineering using isolated mitochondria.

Despite having its own circular genome, the majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA. To respond to changes in cell physiology, the mitochondria must send signals to the nucleus, which can, in turn, upregulate gene expression to alter metabolism or initiate a stress response. This is known as retrograde signaling. A variety of stimuli and pathways fall under the retrograde signaling umbrella. Mitochondrial dysfunction has already been shown to have severe implications for human health. Disruption of retrograde signaling, whether directly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction or cellular environmental changes, may also contribute to pathological deficits.

On the other hand, impairments at the optimal mitochondria function have important consequences in complex diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, among others. These mitochondrial impairments can occur at any age damaging multiple body systems, which have prompted the mitochondrial medicine development. Since mitochondrial diseases have great variability in their clinical manifestations, early studies were centered on mitochondriopathies, however nowadays, this focus has broadened to understand and encompass the mitochondrial role of in diseases development of both pediatric and adult age. The mitochondria potential to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and treatment response strategies has been revealed by experimental approaches using proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics to identify clinical biomarkers showing disease development.

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are the energy production centers in cells and have unique genetic information. Due to the irreplaceable function of mitochondria, mitochondrial dysfunction often leads to pathological changes. Mitochondrial dysfunction induces an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, mitochondrial dynamics dysregulation, and changes in mitophagy. It results in oxidative stress due to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which contributes to cell damage and death. Mitochondrial dysfunction can also trigger inflammation through the activation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), inflammasomes and inflammatory cells. Besides, mitochondrial alterations in the functional regulation, energy metabolism and genetic stability accompany the aging process, and there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, are predisposing factors of aging. Therefore, this review hypothesizes that mitochondria serve as central hubs regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging, and their dysfunction contributes to various diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic diseases, sepsis, ocular pathologies, liver diseases, and autoimmune conditions. Moreover, we outline therapies aimed at various mitochondrial dysfunctions, highlighting their performance in animal models and human trials. Additionally, we focus on the limitations of mitochondrial therapy in clinical applications, and discuss potential future research directions for mitochondrial therapy.",

      "title": "The Role of Mitochondria in Acute Kidney Injury and Chronic Kidney Disease and Its Therapeutic Potential.",
      "abstract": "Mitochondria are heterogeneous and highly dynamic organelles, playing critical roles in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, metabolic modulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cell differentiation and death. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a contributor in many diseases. The kidney is an organ enriched in mitochondria and with high energy demand in the human body. Recent studies have been focusing on how mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of different forms of kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI has been linked to an increased risk of developing CKD. AKI and CKD have a broad clinical syndrome and a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality, encompassing various etiologies and representing important challenges for global public health.&nbsp;Renal mitochondrial disorders are a common feature of diverse forms of AKI and CKD, which result from defects in mitochondrial structure, dynamics, and biogenesis as well as crosstalk of mitochondria with other organelles. Persistent dysregulation of mitochondrial homeostasis in AKI and CKD affects diverse cellular pathways, leading to an increase in renal microvascular loss, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and eventually renal failure. It is important to understand the cellular and molecular events that govern mitochondria functions and pathophysiology in AKI and CKD, which should facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This review provides an overview of the molecular insights of the mitochondria and the specific pathogenic mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of AKI, CKD, and AKI to CKD transition. We also discuss the possible beneficial effects of mitochondrial-targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of mitochondrial dysfunction-mediated AKI and CKD, which may translate into therapeutic options to ameliorate renal injury and delay the progression of these kidney diseases.",

      "abstract": "Healthy aging is the art of balancing a delicate scale. On one side of the scale, there are the factors that make life difficult with aging, and on the other side are the products of human effort against these factors. The most important factors that make the life difficult with aging are age-related disorders. Developing senotherapeutic strategies may bring effective solutions for the sufferers of age-related disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction comes first in elucidating the pathogenesis of age-related disorders and presenting appropriate treatment options. Although it has been widely accepted that mitochondrial dysfunction is a common characteristic of cellular senescence, it still remains unclear why dysfunctional mitochondria occupy a central position in the development senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) related to age-related disorders. Mitochondrial dysfunction and SASP-related disease progression are closely interlinked to weaken immunity which is a common phenomenon in aging. A group of substances known as senotherapeutics targeted to senescent cells can be classified into two main groups: senolytics (kill senescent cells) and senomorphics/senostatics (suppress their SASP secretions) in order to extend health lifespan and potentially lifespan. As mitochondria are also closely related to the survival of senescent cells, using either mitochondria-targeted senolytic or redox modulator senomorphic strategies may help us to solve the complex problems with the detrimental consequences of cellular senescence. Killing of senescent cells and/or ameliorate their SASP-related negative effects are currently considered to be effective mitochondria-directed gerotherapeutic approaches for fighting against age-related disorders.",

      "abstract": "Ischemic/hypoxic injury significantly damages vascular function, detrimentally impacting patient outcomes. Changes in mitochondrial structure and function are closely associated with ischemia/hypoxia-induced vascular dysfunction. The mechanism of this process remains elusive. Using rat models of ischemia and hypoxic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we combined transmission electron microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, and metabolic analysis to analyze the structure and function change of mitochondrial cristae. Multi-omics approaches revealed arginase 1 (Arg1) upregulation in ischemic VSMCs, confirmed by in vivo and in vitro knockout models showing Arg1's protective effects on mitochondrial cristae, mitochondrial and vascular function, and limited the release of mtDNA. Mechanistically, Arg1 interacting with Mic10 led to mitochondrial cristae remodeling, together with hypoxia-induced VDAC1 lactylation resulting in the opening of MPTP and release of mtDNA of VSMCs. The released mtDNA led to PANoptosis of VSMCs via activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. ChIP-qPCR results demonstrated that lactate-mediated Arg1 up-regulation was due to H3K18la upregulation. VSMCs targeted nano-material PLGA-PEI-siRNA@PM-α-SMA (NP-siArg1) significantly improved vascular dysfunction. This study uncovers a new mechanism of vascular dysfunction following ischemic/hypoxic injury: a damaging positive feedback loop mediated by lactate-regulated Arg1 expression between the nucleus and mitochondria, leading to mitochondria cristae disorder and mtDNA release, culminating in VSMCs PANoptosis. Targeting VSMCs Arg1 inhibition offers a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate ischemia/hypoxia-induced vascular impairments.",

      "abstract": "Protein import into mitochondria is a highly regulated process, yet how cells clear mitochondria undergoing dysfunctional protein import remains poorly characterized. Here we showed that mitochondrial protein import stress (MPIS) triggers localized LC3 lipidation. This arm of the mitophagy pathway occurs through the Nod-like receptor (NLR) protein NLRX1 while, surprisingly, without the engagement of the canonical mitophagy protein PINK1. Mitochondrial depolarization, which itself induces MPIS, also required NLRX1 for LC3 lipidation. While normally targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol-retained NLRX1 recruited RRBP1, a ribosome-binding transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, which relocated to the mitochondrial vicinity during MPIS, and the NLRX1/RRBP1 complex in turn controlled the recruitment and lipidation of LC3. Furthermore, NLRX1 controlled skeletal muscle mitophagy in vivo and regulated endurance capacity during exercise. Thus, localization and lipidation of LC3 at the site of mitophagosome formation is a regulated step of mitophagy controlled by NLRX1/RRBP1 in response to MPIS.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria participate in a wide range of cellular processes. One essential function of mitochondria is to be a platform for antiviral signaling proteins during the innate immune response to viral infection. Recently, studies have revealed that mitochondrion-derived DNAs and RNAs are recognized as non-self molecules and act as immunogenic ligands. More importantly, the cytosolic release of these mitochondrial nucleic acids (mt-NAs) is closely associated with the pathogenesis of human diseases accompanying aberrant immune activation. The release of mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) via BAX/BAK activation and/or VDAC1 oligomerization activates the innate immune response and inflammasome assembly. In addition, mitochondrial double-stranded RNAs (mt-dsRNAs) are sensed by pattern recognition receptors in the cytosol to induce type I interferon expression and initiate apoptotic programs. Notably, these cytosolic mt-NAs also mediate adipocyte differentiation and contribute to mitogenesis and mitochondrial thermogenesis. In this review, we summarize recent studies of innate immune signaling pathways regulated by mt-NAs, human diseases associated with mt-NAs, and the emerging physiological roles of mt-NAs.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial and metabolic features of salugenesis and the healing cycle.",
      "abstract": "Pathogenesis and salugenesis are the first and second stages of the two-stage problem of disease production and health recovery. Salugenesis is the automatic, evolutionarily conserved, ontogenetic sequence of molecular, cellular, organ system, and behavioral changes that is used by living systems to heal. It is a whole-body process that begins with mitochondria and the cell. The stages of salugenesis define a circle that is energy- and resource-consuming, genetically programmed, and environmentally responsive. Energy and metabolic resources are provided by mitochondrial and metabolic transformations that drive the cell danger response (CDR) and create the three phases of the healing cycle: Phase 1-Inflammation, Phase 2-Proliferation, and Phase 3-Differentiation. Each phase requires a different mitochondrial phenotype. Without different mitochondria there can be no healing. The rise and fall of extracellular ATP (eATP) signaling is a key driver of the mitochondrial and metabolic reprogramming required to progress through the healing cycle. Sphingolipid and cholesterol-enriched membrane lipid rafts act as rheostats for tuning cellular sensitivity to purinergic signaling. Abnormal persistence of any phase of the CDR inhibits the healing cycle, creates dysfunctional cellular mosaics, causes the symptoms of chronic disease, and accelerates the process of aging. New research reframes the rising tide of chronic disease around the world as a systems problem caused by the combined action of pathogenic triggers and anthropogenic factors that interfere with the mitochondrial functions needed for healing. Once chronic pain, disability, or disease is established, salugenesis-based therapies will start where pathogenesis-based therapies end.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D), one of the most prevalent noncommunicable diseases, is often preceded by insulin resistance (IR), which underlies the inability of tissues to respond to insulin and leads to disturbed metabolic homeostasis. Mitochondria, as a central player in the cellular energy metabolism, are involved in the mechanisms of IR and T2D. Mitochondrial function is affected by insulin resistance in different tissues, among which skeletal muscle and liver have the highest impact on whole-body glucose homeostasis. This review focuses on human studies that assess mitochondrial function in liver, muscle and blood cells in the context of T2D. Furthermore, different interventions targeting mitochondria in IR and T2D are listed, with a selection of studies using respirometry as a measure of mitochondrial function, for better data comparison. Altogether, mitochondrial respiratory capacity appears to be a metabolic indicator since it decreases as the disease progresses but increases after lifestyle (exercise) and pharmacological interventions, together with the improvement in metabolic health. Finally, novel therapeutics developed to target mitochondria have potential for a more integrative therapeutic approach, treating both causative and secondary defects of diabetes.",

The steroid hormone 17β-oestradiol (E2), along with its receptors, is expected to play a major role in the manifestation of sex differences. E2 exerts pleiotropic effects in a system-specific manner. Mitochondria are one of the central targets of E2, and their biogenesis and respiration are known to be modulated by E2. More recently, it has become apparent that E2 also regulates mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamics, thereby affecting cellular metabolism. The aim of this article is to discuss the regulatory pathways by which E2 orchestrates the activity of several components of mitochondrial dynamics in the cardiovascular and nervous systems in health and disease. We conclude that E2 regulates mitochondrial dynamics to maintain the mitochondrial network promoting mitochondrial fusion and attenuating mitochondrial fission in both the cardiovascular and nervous systems.",

      "abstract": "Mitochondria are traditionally known as the powerhouse of the cell, but their functions extend far beyond energy production. They are vital in cellular and organismal pathways that direct metabolism, stress responses, immunity, and cellular fate. To accomplish these tasks, mitochondria have established networks of both intra- and extracellular communication. Intracellularly, these communication routes comprise direct contacts between mitochondria and other subcellular components as well as indirect vesicle transport of ions, metabolites, and other intracellular messengers. Extracellularly, mitochondria can induce stress responses or other cellular changes that secrete mitochondrial cytokine (mitokine) factors that can travel between tissues as well as respond to immune challenges from extracellular sources. Here we provide a current perspective on the major routes of communication for mitochondrial signaling, including their mechanisms and physiological impact. We also review the major diseases and age-related disorders associated with defects in these signaling pathways. An understanding of how mitochondrial signaling controls cellular homeostasis will bring greater insight into how dysfunctional mitochondria affect health in disease and aging.",

While acknowledging the limitations of current experimental methods and their interpretation, we here consider the ramifications of this finding for cellular functions and for evolution. We consider whether mitochondria as heat-producing organelles had a role in the origin of eukaryotes and in the emergence of homeotherms. The homeostatic responses of mitochondrial temperature to externally applied heat imply the existence of a molecular heat-sensing system in mitochondria. While current findings indicate high temperatures for the innermost compartments of mitochondria, those of the mitochondrial surface and of the immediately surrounding cytosol remain to be determined. We ask whether some aspects of mitochondrial dynamics and motility could reflect changes in the supply and demand for mitochondrial heat, and whether mitochondrial heat production could be a factor in diseases and immunity.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial Epigenetics and Environmental Health: Making a Case for Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals.",
      "abstract": "Recent studies implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of numerous chronic diseases, which may be partially due to modifications in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). There is also mounting evidence that epigenetic modifications to mtDNA may be an additional layer of regulation that controls mitochondrial biogenesis and function. Several environmental factors (eg, smoking, air pollution) have been associated with altered mtDNA methylation in a handful of mechanistic studies and in observational human studies. However, little is understood about other environmental contaminants that induce mtDNA epigenetic changes. Numerous environmental toxicants are classified as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Beyond their actions on hormonal pathways, EDC exposure is associated with elevated oxidative stress, which may occur through or result in mitochondrial dysfunction. Although only a few studies have assessed the impacts of EDCs on mtDNA methylation, the current review provides reasons to consider mtDNA epigenetic disruption as a mechanism of action of EDCs and reviews potential limitations related to currently available evidence. First, there is sufficient evidence that EDCs (including bisphenols and phthalates) directly target mitochondrial function, and more direct evidence is needed to connect this to mtDNA methylation. Second, these and other EDCs are potent modulators of nuclear DNA epigenetics, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. Finally, EDCs have been shown to disrupt several modulators of mtDNA methylation, including DNA methyltransferases and the mitochondrial transcription factor A/nuclear respiratory factor 1 pathway. Taken together, these studies highlight the need for future research evaluating mtDNA epigenetic disruption by EDCs and to detail specific mechanisms responsible for such disruptions.",

Proper removal of damaged or unwanted mitochondria is essential for organismal health. Defects in mitophagy are associated with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and other degenerative disorders. Mitochondria regulate organismal fitness and longevity via multiple pathways, including cellular senescence, stem cell function, inflammation, mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR), and bioenergetics. Thus, mitophagy is postulated to be pivotal for maintaining organismal healthspan and lifespan and the protection against aged-related degeneration.

      "abstract": "Decrements in metabolic health elevate disease risk, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Thus, treatment strategies to combat metabolic dysfunction are needed. Reduced ESR1 (estrogen receptor, ERα) expression is observed in muscle from women, men, and animals presenting clinical features of the metabolic syndrome. Human studies of natural expression of ESR1 in metabolic tissues show that muscle expression of ESR1 is positively correlated with markers of metabolic health, including insulin sensitivity. Herein, we highlight the important impact of ERα on mitochondrial form and function and present how these actions of the receptor govern metabolic homeostasis. Studies identifying ERα-regulated pathways for disease prevention will lay the foundation for the design of novel therapeutics to improve the health of women while limiting secondary complications that have plagued traditional hormone replacement interventions.",

      "abstract": "Medical professionals that treat patients with alopecia usually lack knowledge about hair cosmetics. Trichologists focus on hair cycling and growth problems and not on the hair shaft integrity. This may lead to abandon of the use of the prescribed treatment, such as topical minoxidil or to inadequate traumatic grooming habits that may jeopardize hair follicle health. Shampoos, hair dyes, and hair-straightening products may alter hair fiber structure, remove lipids, and elude protein. Hair procedures such as hair dying and straightening have side effects and health concerns, especially for pregnant women or sensitive hair and scalp patients. Hair breakage, follicle traction, frizz, contact dermatitis, and mutagenicity are possible side effects of hair cosmetics misuse. The proper use of hair care products may help to increase patients' adherence to alopecia treatments and avoid health problems related to inadequate application of hair cosmetics and procedures.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is a widespread health problem that affects numerous individuals and is associated with age, lack of sleep, stress, endocrine problems, and other problems. Caffeine exerts various pharmacological effects, particularly after ingestion. The caffeine-induced inhibition of phosphodiesterases can increase intracellular cAMP concentrations, ultimately resulting in stimulatory effects on cell metabolism and proliferation. Hence, caffeine has been confirmed to inhibit hair loss caused by premature termination of the hair growth phase. Adenosine also improves hair loss by stimulating hair growth and thickening hair shafts. However, further empirical evidence is required to comprehensively assess the efficacy of hair loss treatment and prevention using a formulation of caffeine and adenosine in specific proportions in shampoos.",

      "title": "Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia: An Update.",
      "abstract": "In this review, we discuss recent developments in our understanding of frontal fibrosing alopecia, a disease that has become increasingly common and widespread since its first description in 1994. An inherited predisposition to frontal fibrosing alopecia, previously suspected from the occurrence of familial cases, has been confirmed through genetic studies. Nevertheless, the epidemiology continues to implicate environmental factors in the aetiology. The search has focussed mainly on personal skin care products such as facial moisturisers and UV filters, and there is also some evidence implicating exogenous oestrogens, but confirmation of direct causal links has so far proved elusive. The pathologic mechanisms underlying follicular deletion are being clarified, including the nature of the inflammatory component, the loss of follicular immune privilege in the bulge region and the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the scarring process. Lichen planus pigmentosus, a common accompaniment to frontal fibrosing alopecia in those with darker skin, is probably a feature of the same pathology affecting interfollicular epidermis, rather than a co-morbidity, and may offer new clues to the aetiology. Treatment is still based largely on retrospective case series and variable endpoints. However, methods for assessing frontal fibrosing alopecia and monitoring treatment responses have been strengthened and randomised controlled trials with novel agents (e.g. Janus kinase inhibitors) are in progress. As the main aim of effective treatment is to prevent disease progression, early diagnosis will remain an important target, as will prevention in the longer term.",

      "abstract": "Plant-derived secondary metabolites (polyphenols/terpenes/alkaloids) and microbial exometabolites/membrane components of fermented tropical fruits are known as highly bioavailable biomolecules causing skin and hair improvement effects (wound healing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, antiacne, skin/hair microbiota balancing, hair growth-promoting, and hair loss-inhibiting). Caffein is considered as a hair growth promoter. A randomized placebo- and caffein-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of fermented papaya (FP) plus fermented mangosteen (FM) towards human hair quality and loss was conducted. Shampoo and lotion hair care products containing FP, FM, and caffein as active agents were developed and applied to 154 subjects of both sexes with clinically confirmed androgenic or diffuse alopecia for 3 months. Their clinical efficacy was assessed subjectively by questionnaires filled in by dermatologists/trichologists, and by the objective trichomicroscopical calculations. Hair and scalp skin quality was determined by microbiota pattern and ATP, SH-groups, protein, and malonyl dialdehyde quantification. Comparative clinical data showed that the experimental hair care cosmetics significantly inhibited hair loss, increased hair density/thickness, and improved hair follicle structure versus placebo and caffein controls. The cosmetics with FP and FM substantially normalized the microbiota pattern and increased ATP content in hair follicle, while inhibiting lipid peroxidation in the scalp skin, and SH-group formation in the hair shaft.",

      "abstract": "The scar repair inevitably causes damage of skin function and loss of skin appendages such as hair follicles (HF). It is of great challenge in wound repair that how to intervene in scar formation while simultaneously remodeling HF niche and inducing in situ HF regeneration. Here, chemical reprogramming techniques are used to identify a clinically chemical cocktail (Tideglusib and Tamibarotene) that can drive fibroblasts toward dermal papilla cell (DPC) fate. Considering the advantage of biomaterials in tissue repair and their regulation in cell behavior that may contributes to cellular reprogramming, the artificial HF seeding (AHFS) hydrogel microspheres, inspired by the natural processes of \"seeding and harvest\", are constructed via using a combination of liposome nanoparticle drug delivery system, photoresponsive hydrogel shell, positively charged polyamide modification, microfluidic and photocrosslinking techniques. The identified chemical cocktail is as the core nucleus of AHFS. In vitro and in vivo studies show that AHFS can regulate fibroblast fate, induce fibroblast-to-DPC reprogramming by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway, finally promoting wound healing and in situ HF regeneration while inhibiting scar formation in a two-pronged translational approach. In conclusion, AHFS provides a new and effective strategy for functional repair of skin wounds.",

      "title": "Predictors and Management of Inadequate Response to JAK Inhibitors in Alopecia Areata.",
      "abstract": "Alopecia areata is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by non-scarring hair loss on the scalp or other hair-bearing surface. In recent years, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of alopecia areata by disrupting the signaling pathways involved in immune-mediated hair follicle damage. However, some patients with alopecia areata exhibit insufficient responses to JAK inhibitors. This review aims to explore the predictive factors for poor responses to JAK inhibitors in patients with alopecia areata and to discuss alternative treatment strategies in such cases. Patients with a longer duration of the current episode and higher baseline severity are at an increased risk of inadequate JAK inhibitor responses. Oral administration rather than topical application, and extended treatment durations, correlate with a favorable response. Notably, the poor response to JAK inhibitors in alopecia areata may be related to the amount and functional depletion of regulatory T cells resulting from an augmented T helper-2-type immune response. For patients with poor responses to JAK inhibitors, treatment adjustments may include increasing the dosage, extending the treatment duration, combination therapies, or switching to alternative JAK inhibitors. For patients with atopic comorbidities or psychological problems, it is important to select corresponding treatment options to optimize patient outcomes. Further research is needed to establish more reliable predictors and improve overall patient care.",

      "abstract": "Skin regenerative capacity declines with age, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate a functional link between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and type XVII collagen (COL17A1) proteolysis on age-associated alteration of keratinocyte stem cell dynamics in skin regeneration. Live-imaging and computer simulation experiments predicted that human keratinocyte stem cell motility is coupled with self-renewal and epidermal regeneration. Receptor tyrosine kinase array identified the age-associated decline of EGFR signaling in mouse skin wound healing. Culture experiments proved that EGFR activation drives human keratinocyte stem cell motility with increase of COL17A1 by inhibiting its proteolysis through the secretion of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1). Intriguingly, COL17A1 directly regulated keratinocyte stem cell motility and collective cell migration by coordinating actin and keratin filament networks. We conclude that EGFR-COL17A1 axis-mediated keratinocyte stem cell motility drives epidermal regeneration, which provides a novel therapeutic approach for age-associated impaired skin regeneration.",

      "title": "Nanomaterials in hair care and treatment.",
      "abstract": "Hair care and treatment has evolved significantly through the years as new formulations are continuously being explored in an attempt to meet the demand in cosmetic and medicinal fields. While standard hair care procedures include hair washing, aimed at hair cleansing and maintenance, as well as hair dyeing and bleaching formulations for hair embellishment, modern hair treatments are mainly focused on circumventing hair loss conditions, strengthening hair follicle properties and treat hair infestations. In this regard, active compounds (ACs) included in hair cosmetic formulations include a vast array of hair cleansing and hair dye molecules, and typical hair treatments include anti-hair loss ACs (e.g. minoxidil and finasteride) and anti-lice ACs (e.g. permethrin). However, several challenges still persist, as conventional AC formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, calling for an improved design of formulations regarding both efficacy and safety. More recently, nano-based strategies encompassing nanomaterials have emerged as promising tailored approaches to improve the performance of ACs incorporated into hair cosmetics and treatment formulations. The interest in using these nanomaterials is based on account of their ability to: (1) increase stability, safety and biocompatibility of ACs; (2) maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, acting as versatile biointerfaces; (3) enable the controlled release of ACs in both hair and scalp, serving as prolonged AC reservoirs; besides offering (4) hair follicle targeting features attending to the possibility of surface tunability. This review covers the breakthrough of nanomaterials for hair cosmetics and hair treatment, focusing on organic nanomaterials (polymer-based and lipid-based nanoparticles) and inorganic nanomaterials (nanosheets, nanotubes and inorganic nanoparticles), as well as their applications, highlighting their potential as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This manuscript is focused on reviewing the nanotechnological strategies investigated for hair care and treatment so far. While conventional formulations exhibit sub-optimal performance and some may present toxicity issues, the selection of improved and suitable nanodelivery systems is of utmost relevance to ensure a proper active ingredient release in both hair and scalp, maximize hair affinity, contact and retention, and provide hair follicle targeting features, warranting stability, efficacy and safety. This innovative manuscript highlights the advantages of nanotechnology-based approaches, particularly as tunable and versatile biointerfaces, and their applications as innovative multifunctional nanomaterials towards maximized hair care and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and is widely used for dietary supplements and topical applications. D-panthenol has long been used in hair care products for the purpose of anti-hair loss, its effects and the underlying mechanisms, however, were barely reported. In this study, the effects of D-panthenol on human hair follicle cells, including dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and outer root sheath cells (hORSCs), were investigated. D-panthenol enhanced the cell viability, increasing the cellular proliferation marker Ki67 in cultured hDPCs. The markers for apoptosis (Caspase3/9) and cell senescence (p21/p16), reported to be expressed in aged or resting phase follicles, were significantly reduced by D-panthenol. Anagen-inducing factors (ALP; β-catenin; versican), which trigger or elongate the anagen phase, were stimulated by D-panthenol. On the other hand, D-panthenol reduced TGF-β1 expressions in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of VEGF, which is important for peripheral blood vessel activation; was up-regulated by D-panthenol treatment. In cultured hORSCs, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced, while the mRNA expression of cell senescence markers (p21/p16) was significantly down-regulated. The expressions of both VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were up-regulated by D-panthenol. In conclusion, our data suggest that the hair growth stimulating activity of D-panthenol was exerted by increasing the cell viability, suppressing the apoptotic markers, and elongating the anagen phase in hair follicles.",

      "abstract": "RASopathies are rare genetic disorders caused by germline pathogenic variants in genes belonging to the RAS/MAPK pathway, which signals cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and death. The dysfunction of such signaling pathway causes syndromes with overlapping clinical manifestations. Skin and adnexal lesions are the cardinal clinical signs of RASopathies, such as cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, Noonan syndrome with multiple lentigines, formerly known as LEOPARD syndrome, Costello syndrome, neurofibromatosis (NF1), Legius syndrome, Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NSLH) and Noonan syndrome. As NF1, one of the most common RASopathies, described in 1882, has its clinical features well delineated, we will focus on the dermatological diagnosis, management and care of non-NF1 RASopathies, which are less known and more recently described. Dermatological manifestations are important clinical diagnostic elements that can aid differential diagnosis among RASopathies. They can affect dermis and epidermis, causing pigmented lesions (melanocytic nevi, café-au-lait spots, and lentigines), hyperkeratosis (keratosis pilaris, ulerythema ophryogenes, and palmoplantar keratosis) or hyperplasia. To date there are rare known links to malignancy, but oftentimes skin lesions require close attention because they can highly affect quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Functional appendage regeneration is essential for skin rehabilitation, but it has always failed by current existing healing approaches, owing to their inefficacy in preventing disfiguring scars. In this study, a novel regeneration-directing artificial skin (RDAS) system is presented, which is based on the rational design of multi-layered hydrogels that closely mimic natural skin matrices. By leveraging the programmability and architectural rigidity of DNA components, without the need for exogenous cell transplantation, such RDAS effectively minimizes tissue fibrosis by accurately guiding the regenerative process in wound fibroblasts, enabling rapid scarless wound repair, restoration of dermal function, and successful in situ regeneration of multiple appendages, such as hair follicles (HFs), sebaceous glands (SGs), and sweat glands (SwGs). Therefore, the RDAS offers a cell-free antiscarring therapeutic strategy for regenerative wound healing, resulting in improved outcomes. This innovative approach holds great potential for future clinical applications and burn rehabilitation.",

Studies have indicated that TWEAK/Fn14 pathway activation controls multiple cellular responses, including proliferation, angiogenesis and induction of inflammatory cytokines. TWEAK/Fn14 is manifested in many tissues of our body and most importantly in the skin causing inflammation and many autoimmune and neoplastic cutaneous disorders. Evidence suggests that the TWEAK/Fn14 axis, the downstream signalling pathway and its inflammatory molecular expressions are involved in the pathogenesis of many cutaneous disorders such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD) vitiligo and melanoma. So, this literature review describes a brief introduction of TWEAK and TWEAK/Fn14 pathway and summarises the case-series and open-label studies performed in the field of dermatology and its potential therapeutic benefit.",

      "abstract": "Hair disorders, including central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), traction alopecia (TA), and acquired trichorrhexis nodosa (ATN), commonly occur in individuals with curly textured hair. Curly textured hair in individuals of African descent has unique properties and can present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. CCCA has been linked to uterine leiomyoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as fibroproliferation. TA often presents with a fringe sign and can arise from high-tension hairstyles presumed to be protective. Trichoscopy is useful in establishing a diagnosis; perifollicular halos are more commonly seen than perifollicular erythema or scale in CCCA. In TA, miniaturized follicles, hair casts, and \"flambeau sign\" can be seen. Hairstyling practices likely contribute to TA and ATN; however, the data are mixed on the role of chemical relaxers and heat styling in CCCA. Unique considerations in the presentation of frontal fibrosing alopecia in curly textured hair have also been published recently. This review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date summary of these disorders with an emphasis on their unique properties, as well as considerations in hair care for curly textured hair.",

Bony support is lost along the mandible and maxilla and the orbital aperture widens. Superficial and deep fat pads undergo volume loss and migration and the overlying skin begins to reveal signs of both intrinsic aging with skin laxity and fine rhytids as well as extrinsic aging in the form of coarse, deeper rhytids and dyspigmentation.",

The authors describe the first use of this technique in Caucasians with dermatochalasis and lateral hooding. This is a retrospective case series of Caucasian patients who underwent subbrow blepharoplasty for moderate to severe dermatochalasis with lateral hooding. Patients were included when the skin excess of the upper lid was noted predominantly as a lateral hooding over the lateral half of the upper lid. A modified subbrow blepharoplasty technique was used and will be described in detail. Fifty patients underwent the procedure from January of 2017 to June of 2018, 18 female and 32 male patients. The average age of the patients was 71.4 years (range, 59 to 84 years). Minimum patient follow-up was 3 months. An internal browpexy and a periosteal fixation were combined with subbrow blepharoplasty for 22 patients (14 men and eight women). Patient satisfaction with the result of the procedure and incision line were assessed. All 50 patients were satisfied with the surgical results. No patients noted any issues with the incision. No patients complained of incision problems, but the surgeon noted two patients with redness in the scar at 3 months that improved over a 12-month follow-up. Subbrow blepharoplasty may be an alternative to the classic upper lid blepharoplasty in older Caucasian patients, as it can address moderate to severe dermatochalasis with lateral hooding.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes (cVMS) are ubiquitous in hair care products (HCPs). cVMS emissions from HCPs are of concern, given the potential adverse impact of siloxanes on the environment and human health. To characterize cVMS emissions and exposures during the use of HCPs, realistic hair care experiments were conducted in a residential building. Siloxane-based HCPs were tested using common hair styling techniques, including straightening, curling, waving, and oiling. VOC concentrations were measured via proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry. HCP use drove rapid changes in the chemical composition of the indoor atmosphere. cVMS dominated VOC emissions from HCP use, and decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) contributed the most to cVMS emissions. cVMS emission factors (EFs) during hair care routines ranged from 110-1500 mg/person and were influenced by HCP type, styling tools, operation temperatures, and hair length. The high temperature of styling tools and the high surface area of hair enhanced VOC emissions. Increasing the hair straightener temperature from room temperature to 210 °C increased cVMS EFs by 50-310%. Elevated indoor cVMS concentrations can result in substantial indoor-to-outdoor transport of cVMS via ventilation (0.4-6 tons D5/year in the U.S.); thus, hair care routines may augment the abundance of cVMS in the outdoor atmosphere.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of beauty and personal care industries, many hair-relevant products, hair dyes and hair perms in particular, are increasingly prevalent in both women and men, regardless of being young or old as they frequently change hair color or shape to enhance youthfulness and beauty and to follow fashion trends. Hair dyes and perms alter hair color and/or shape by mechanically changing the physical structure and chemical substances of the hair shaft. However, treatment of hair with chemical formulations has been potentially ascribed to adverse outcomes in the hair shaft including structure damage, chemical constituent disorder, and impaired physical properties, although hair cosmetics procedures are intrinsically safe. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of impairment in the hair shaft and scalp induced by hair dyeing and perming remain elusive. Additionally, adverse reactions activated by exposure to specific chemical ingredients including skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), and even cancer risk have been reported clinically, but existing evidence is not consistent enough in the case of human studies. Herein, the review aims to give an overview of hair cosmetics, especially concerning the basic knowledge about various hair dyes and perms, the consequences for hair shafts and the scalp resulting from the application of hair cosmetics mentioned above, mechanisms of hazardous outcomes, and potential desirable interventions to alleviate the impairment.",

For hypertrichosis, various syndromes such as Ambras, Cantú, and Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome are elucidated, highlighting their distinct clinical features and genetic underpinnings. Hypotrichosis syndromes include Bjornstad's, Netherton and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes.

First, we review the 2 main local anesthetics used in hair transplantation, lidocaine and bupivacaine, how to achieve long-lasting local anesthesia, and what techniques can be used to minimize the pain associated with anesthetic infiltrations. Second, we review the 2 donor harvesting techniques currently used: strip harvesting follicular unit transplantation and follicular unit excision. The technical aspects of each technique are described in detail, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Third, the different methods of graft implantation currently used by the majority of hair surgeons are discussed, including premade sites and stick-and-place and the use of tools such as implanters. Fourth, postoperative care, expected results, and the main complications involved in hair transplant surgery are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Since olden days, medicinal and aromatic plants have been consumed due to their well-known therapeutic, ornamental, culinary, and cosmetic properties. Plant-based cosmetics comprise a growing market offering brands of sustainable products with the ultimate goal of responding to the woman needs to boost their natural beauty, such as soothing, toning, moisturizing and protecting skin and hair. The increasing focus on body and beauty care, combined with a better understanding of the diverse biological effects of plants and their derivatives, has revitalized their significance in aesthetic, cosmetic, and dermatological contexts. Concurrently, the increasing prevalence of allergies and hypersensitivity reactions to synthetic additives commonly found in cosmetics and other skin products has spurred interest in seeking healthier and more efficacious natural alternatives. An intense investigation has been stated around the formulation of medicinal plants- and other plant-based cosmetic products for dermatological and aesthetic purposes. Similarly, a raising awareness by cosmetics' manufacturers and related industries have been progressively stated, culminating with the emergence of a line of plant-based cosmetics increasingly safe and with reliable quality features for multiple purposes. Although a high demand for natural-based products for cosmetic purposes has been stated, further studies are required to deepening knowledge on their beneficial properties, safety and quality features and to identify the main limitations and likelihood of side effects occurrence. In this review, an outlook of the current scenario regarding the use of medicinal and aromatic plants as cosmetic ingredients in the formulation of skin care and other dermatological products traditionally used by the Mediterranean woman for prevention and even cure of skin and hair diseases or for beautification is provided.",

      "abstract": "Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is the most common form of primary scarring alopecia in women of African descent, negatively impacting their quality of life. Treatment is often challenging, and we usually direct therapy to suppress and prevent the inflammation. However, factors affecting clinical outcomes are still unknown. To characterize medical features, concurrent medical conditions, hair care practices, and treatments used for patients with CCCA and assess their relationship with treatment outcomes. We analyzed data from a retrospective chart review of 100 patients diagnosed with CCCA who received treatment for at least one year. Treatment outcomes were compared with patient characteristics to determine any relationships. P-values were calculated using logistic regression and univariate analysis with 95% CI P < 0.05 was considered significant. After one year of treatment, 50% of patients were stable, 36% improved, and 14% worsened. Patients without a history of thyroid disease (P = 0.0422), using metformin for diabetes control (P = 0.0255), using hooded dryers (P = 0.0062), wearing natural hairstyles (P = 0.0103), and having no other physical signs besides cicatricial alopecia (P = 0.0228), had higher odds of improvement after treatment. Patients with scaling (P = 0.0095) or pustules (P = 0.0325) had higher odds of worsening. Patients with a history of thyroid disease (P = 0.0188), not using hooded dryers (0.0438), or not wearing natural hairstyles (P = 0.0098) had higher odds of remaining stable. Clinical characteristics, concurrent medical conditions, and hair care practices may affect clinical outcomes after treatment. With this information, providers can adjust proper therapies and evaluations for patients with Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.",

      "title": "A Comment on Mercantilism in the Trichological Sciences.",
      "abstract": "A quasi-scientific interest in hair loss and hair care originated in a London barbershop, and became known as trichology, with the Institute of Trichologists being founded. Other corporations successively followed, offering paid courses by home-study for training of initiates who desire more knowledge about hair. Trichologists are not medically qualified but are taught the practice of care and treatment of the hair and scalp in health and disease within their restricted but specialized role. With the advent of opportunities in the social media, and of epiluminiscence microscopy, a procedure practiced by the guild of trichologists long before its nominal introduction as trichoscopy into dermatologic practice, representatives of the medical profession are following the example of the trichologists in offering online courses, though with a better understanding of clinical-pathological correlations based on their academic learning. Despite the enthusiasm emerging with its establishment as a dermatologic tool in the diagnosis of hair and scalp disorders, caution is warranted not to elevate trichoscopy to something like a fetish status. As a diagnostic procedure, trichoscopy is to be understood as representing an integral part of a comprehensive dermatological examination. The Hippocratic Oath is one of the oldest binding documents in history, allegedly still held sacred by physicians: to treat the ill to the best of one's ability, to preserve a patient's privacy, and to teach the secrets of medicine to the next generation without fee. And yet, as in no other field of medicine, paid online courses on trichoscopy are flourishing and with a primary commercial aim. However, dermato-trichology, or trichiatry require the same due diligence as any other medical discipline, with respect to its practice and its ethics. Medical artistry is neither reducible to a single hand-held diagnostic technique nor is it negotiable.",

There are no legal requirements to prove that these products live up to their claims. The name is a combination of \"cosmetics\" and \"pharmaceuticals\". \"Nutricosmetics\" are related dietary supplements or food or beverage products with additives that are marketed as having medical benefits that affect appearance. Cosmetic-containing herbals are topical cosmetic-pharmaceutical hybrids intended to enhance the health and beauty of the skin. Cosmetic-containing herbals improve appearance by delivering essential nutrients to the skin. Several herbal products, such as cosmetic-containing herbals, are available. The present review highlights the use of natural products in cosmetic-containing herbals, as natural products have many curative effects as well as healing effects on skin and hair growth with minimal to no side effects. A brief description is given on such plants, their used parts, active ingredients, and the therapeutic properties associated with them. Mainly, the utilization of phytoconstituents as cosmetic-containing herbals in the care of skin and hair, such as dryness of skin, acne, eczema, inflammation of the skin, aging, hair growth, and dandruff, along with natural ingredients, such as for hair colorant, are explained in detail in the present review.",

      "abstract": "Beauty is an eternal pursuit of all people. Wound repair, anti-aging, inhibiting hyperpigmentation and hair loss are the main demands for medical aesthetics. At present, the repair and remodeling of human body shape and function in medical aesthetics are often achieved by injection of antioxidants, hyaluronic acid and botulinum toxin, stem cell therapy. However, there are some challenges, such as difficulty controlling the injection dose, abnormal local contour, increased foreign body sensation, and the risk of tumor occurrence and deformity induced by stem cell therapy. Exosomes are tiny vesicles secreted by cells, which are rich in proteins, nucleic acids and other bioactive molecules. They have the characteristics of low immunogenicity and strong tissue penetration, making them ideal for applications in medical aesthetics. However, their low yield, strong heterogeneity, and long-term preservation still hinder their application in medical aesthetics. In this review, we summarize the mechanism of action, administration methods, engineered production and preservation technologies for exosomes in medical aesthetics in recent years to further promote their research and industrialization in the field of medical aesthetics.",

      "abstract": "Eyelashes evolved to protect eyes. An optimum eyelash length functions to protect eyes from external hazards such as contaminations, excessive evaporation or shear stress from airflow. They can also be an indicator of a person's health as various congenital and noncongenital diseases can lead to short or long eyelashes. The current study aimed to extend a recent investigation on the preference for eyelash length in humans from an evolutionary adaptive perspective. Specifically, the current study tested whether the inverted-U function for eyelash length preference recently reported for White faces, generalises to other ethnicities, and whether ethnic background modulates preference for eyelash lengths. To investigate this question, men and women of Asian, Black, and White ethnicities from the U.S. rated the attractiveness of female Indian, Asian, Black, and White faces with varying eyelash lengths. The eyelashes ranged in length from no eyelashes to half the width of an eye. Results showed that Asian, Black, and White men and women preference for eyelash length followed an inverted-U function across all four ethnicities, supporting a general preference for human eyelash length that is approximately one-third the width of an eye. In addition, the results showed that the most attractive eyelashes for Black women were skewed toward a greater eyelash-length to eye-width ratio when compared to the other images. The source of this skew is presently unknown, as it could reflect a change in perceptual sensitivity to eyelash length with skin colour or changes in preference related to perceptions of participants' ethnicity.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of impairment in hair and scalp induced by hair dyeing and perming and potential interventions.",
      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of beauty and personal care industries, many hair-relevant products, hair dyes and hair perms in particular, are increasingly prevalent in both women and men, regardless of being young or old as they frequently change hair color or shape to enhance youthfulness and beauty and to follow fashion trends. Hair dyes and perms alter hair color and/or shape by mechanically changing the physical structure and chemical substances of the hair shaft. However, treatment of hair with chemical formulations has been potentially ascribed to adverse outcomes in the hair shaft including structure damage, chemical constituent disorder, and impaired physical properties, although hair cosmetics procedures are intrinsically safe. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of impairment in the hair shaft and scalp induced by hair dyeing and perming remain elusive. Additionally, adverse reactions activated by exposure to specific chemical ingredients including skin irritation, allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), and even cancer risk have been reported clinically, but existing evidence is not consistent enough in the case of human studies. Herein, the review aims to give an overview of hair cosmetics, especially concerning the basic knowledge about various hair dyes and perms, the consequences for hair shafts and the scalp resulting from the application of hair cosmetics mentioned above, mechanisms of hazardous outcomes, and potential desirable interventions to alleviate the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Skin, hair, and nail supplements, sometimes referred to as \"beauty supplements\" or \"ingestible skin care,\" are a large and growing industry. These products may contain vitamins and minerals, sometimes in very high doses. They may also contain herbs, hormones, microbes, or animal derivatives such as fish oils and collagen powders. Dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not as drugs, by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, manufacturers do not need to provide any proof of safety, efficacy, or quality prior to sale. This is of serious concern, as many adverse effects due to supplement components have been reported. The potential risks cover multiple categories. These include acute toxicities, such as choking, as well as chronic toxicities, such as increased risk of diabetes. Teratogenicity and interactions with drugs and laboratory testing have been documented in research studies. Other risks include potentially increased risk of cancer with long-term use, allergic reactions, and others. It is vital that physicians educate their patients on these risks. As no post-marketing surveillance programs are required for supplements, our understanding of supplement risks is incomplete. Physicians should be wary of these risks and encourage further research and regulation.",

      "abstract": "The field of facial cosmetic surgery is rapidly expanding and becoming more well-known worldwide. Over the past century, there have been notable developments in medical technology, accessibility to resources, and patient demand for facial plastic surgery in India, a country that has become a global leader in this sector. This study aims to perform a thorough evaluation of current trends and past practises in aesthetic operations and facial plastic surgery in India. In order to do this, common nonsurgical treatments including threaded processes, Botox injections Kybella, filler substances, micro-focused ultrasound, and pharmacologic hair transplantation will be examined in contrast to common surgical treatments like face lifts, blepharoplasty, rhinoplasty procedure and transplantation of hair. In addition, the goal of this study is to give a more complete look at the future trends in the field and make facial beauty tips. A thorough search of the literature was done using several databases, including Cochrane, PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. A scoping review and an evidence-based synthesis came next. The initial search yielded 703 publications in all; 53 of these were deemed relevant to the subject at hand, after which they were investigated and discussed. The poll indicates that there has been a noticeable increase of India has seen a rise in the number of people getting plastic surgery on their faces and a clear change in how patients feel about painless cosmetic procedures. This study examines the latest advancements and patterns in medical practitioners' methods to bolster the expansion of cosmetic face surgery in India. It also seeks to solve the inadequacies in the current administration and close the gaps that can be found in the realm of cosmetic surgery.",

      "abstract": "Since olden days, medicinal and aromatic plants have been consumed due to their well-known therapeutic, ornamental, culinary, and cosmetic properties. Plant-based cosmetics comprise a growing market offering brands of sustainable products with the ultimate goal of responding to the woman needs to boost their natural beauty, such as soothing, toning, moisturizing and protecting skin and hair. The increasing focus on body and beauty care, combined with a better understanding of the diverse biological effects of plants and their derivatives, has revitalized their significance in aesthetic, cosmetic, and dermatological contexts. Concurrently, the increasing prevalence of allergies and hypersensitivity reactions to synthetic additives commonly found in cosmetics and other skin products has spurred interest in seeking healthier and more efficacious natural alternatives. An intense investigation has been stated around the formulation of medicinal plants- and other plant-based cosmetic products for dermatological and aesthetic purposes. Similarly, a raising awareness by cosmetics' manufacturers and related industries have been progressively stated, culminating with the emergence of a line of plant-based cosmetics increasingly safe and with reliable quality features for multiple purposes. Although a high demand for natural-based products for cosmetic purposes has been stated, further studies are required to deepening knowledge on their beneficial properties, safety and quality features and to identify the main limitations and likelihood of side effects occurrence. In this review, an outlook of the current scenario regarding the use of medicinal and aromatic plants as cosmetic ingredients in the formulation of skin care and other dermatological products traditionally used by the Mediterranean woman for prevention and even cure of skin and hair diseases or for beautification is provided.",

      "abstract": "Jojoba oil, which is extracted from jojoba plant seeds that are native to North America, possesses a unique molecular structure and is distinct from other oils. Unlike typical oils, which mostly contain triglycerides, jojoba oil is composed of long monounsaturated esters, affording it exceptional properties and is valuable across cosmetics, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. While jojoba oil is prevalent in beauty and skincare today, its seeds and oil have ancient roots in folk medicine, used for treating skin and scalp issues, wounds, sore throats, obesity, and even cancer, while enhancing immunity and fostering hair growth. Modern research underscores jojoba oil's pharmacological versatility, demonstrating antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-acne, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antibacterial properties. Notably, there has been a surge in its utilization in pharmaceuticals, particularly in topical, transdermal, and parenteral formulations. This review provides a comprehensive overview of jojoba oil, encompassing its chemical composition, extraction techniques, health advantages, and pharmaceutical application developments.",

      "abstract": "We have conducted a thorough review of the literature to assess the evidence for supporting a cause-and-effect linkage between scalp condition and resultant hair condition. Over 20 epidemiological studies have been published covering a wide range of abnormal scalp conditions in which consequent impacts to the hair have been documented. A treatment study was conducted to demonstrate not only that impaired scalp condition led to impaired hair quality but that the impacts to hair are reversible upon normalization of the scalp condition. A proposed explanation involves the impact of scalp oxidative stress, which is part of the etiology of these scalp conditions as well as normal aging, in interfering with the normal keratinization of the pre-emergent hair cuticle. This perturbed cuticle impedes normal fiber anchorage and emerges more brittle and fragile than normal cuticle leading to accelerated physical degradation, mirroring the effects of chronological aging of the hair fiber. The consequences of the rapid cuticle degradation result in hair that is more vulnerable to mechanical insults and compromised overall quality.",

      "abstract": "A characteristic feature of the anatomy of the human face is its arrangement in layers. The main layers include, from outside to inside: (i) the skin; (ii) the subcutaneous fat; (iii) the superficial musculoaponeurotic system; (iv) the deep fat, and (iv) the periosteum overlying the bony structures of the skull. Herein, the facial bones provide the basis for the ligaments and other facial structures that are attached to them. In contrast, the muscles control the mimics and movements, hence the dynamic anatomy of the face. The skin represents the outermost structure of the body and protects the organism from external physical, chemical, and biological stresses. The strive for facial attractiveness and beauty is a strong motivation for cosmetic and aesthetic procedures, including (permanent) makeup, minimal-invasive up to invasive surgical interventions, which have dramatically increased in numbers over the past decades. A youthful appearance is regarded as one of the essential characteristics of an attractive face. The characteristic features of the aging face are a downward migration of the facial soft tissues, a loss in volume of the fat compartments, the formation of mimic wrinkles, a decrease in dermal hydration, and others. Modern anti-aging treatments aim to reverse these alterations with the least possible side effects. However, effective and safe cosmetic, aesthetic, and medical treatments presume a profound knowledge of facial anatomy.",

Despite the considerable use of cosmetics, most people are unaware of its adverse reactions. Urticaria is severe as well as the most common adverse reaction caused by cosmetics. Major cosmetics that cause urticaria include fragrance, preservatives, hair care products, lip plumbers, plant- and animal-derived products, bindi or kumkum, nail cosmetics, glycol peel, permanent makeup and tattoos, etc. This review provides a brief explanation of the cosmetic components that cause urticaria.",

These products are not regulated by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and hence there is no centralized database listing current products. The goal of this study was to document and examine the labeling and marketing methods of these products. Methods Supplements including the words \"glow,\" \"beauty,\" \"skin,\" \"hair,\" or \"nails\" on the label were included in the sample. Seven stores within a 3-mile radius were included. Results A total of 176 unique supplements were identified. It was found that most products lacked independent testing; many utilized outdated daily values (DVs) of nutrients. Some had confusing dosing instructions, and most products made health-related marketing claims. Conclusion Dermatologists and primary care providers should be aware of the marketing claims commonly made by these products. Patients should be educated that these claims are generally not verified by independent testing agencies, the U.S. FDA, or by high-quality randomized control trials.",

A 28-year-old woman presented to us complaining of pain and swelling affecting the small joints of the hands bilaterally lasting for 7 weeks. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable only for an increase of acute-phase reactants, while the rest of laboratory tests including serological tests for viruses, as well as immunological tests were negative or within normal limits. She noticed a close correlation between the onset of symmetrical polyarthritis and the use of HD product. Thus, after excluding other possibilities of inflammatory arthritides, the diagnosis of HD-induced arthritis was made. The patient was treated with naproxen, and after 3 weeks, she had a complete clinical response with decrease of acute-phase reactants. Thus, we review and discuss the relevant literature of cases related with the use of HD and arthritis development. This is the first described case of HD-induced arthritis. Physicians must be aware and recognize these symptoms and signs of patients exposed to HD and treat them appropriately.",

The current treatment for alopecia is varied. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates activated platelet rich plasma (A-PRP) for alopecia treatment. The objective of this review was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of A-PRP injections in alopecia patients. We compared the safety, limitations, and outcomes of A-PRP use with those of previous research on alopecia. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar for relevant articles. We included all primary clinical studies involving patients that evaluated A-PRP. Twenty-nine articles, which included 864 patients, met the eligibility criteria and were analyzed for qualitative review. Our review found 27 studies that indicated A-PRP was significantly effective in treating alopecia, especially for improving hair density before and after therapy (n = 184, mean difference [MD] = 46.5, I2 = 88%, 95% CI: 29.63, 63.37, P < .00001), as well as when comparison was made between treatment and control groups (n = 88, MD = 31.61, I2 = 80%, 95% CI: 6.99, 56.22, P = .01), and of terminal hair density between treatment and control groups (n = 55, MD = 26.03, I2 = 25%, 95% CI: 8.08, 43.98, P = .004); hair counts after therapy (n = 85, MD = 12.79, I2 = 83%, 95% CI: -5.53, 31.12, P = .0006); promoting hair regrowth; folliculogenesis; reducing hair loss; combining with follicular unit extraction (FUE) surgery; and initiating the hair cycle.

      "abstract": "The market demand for marine-based cosmetics has shown a tremendous growth rate in the last decade. Marine resources represent a promising source of novel bioactive compounds for new cosmetic ingredient development. However, concern about sustainability also becomes an issue that should be considered in developing cosmetic ingredients. The fisheries industry (e.g., fishing, farming, and processing) generates large amounts of leftovers containing valuable substances, which are potent sources of cosmeceutical ingredients. Several bioactive substances could be extracted from the marine by-product that can be utilized as a potent ingredient to develop cosmetics products. Those bioactive substances (e.g., collagen from fish waste and chitin from crustacean waste) could be utilized as anti-photoaging, anti-wrinkle, skin barrier, and hair care products. From this perspective, this review aims to approach the potential active ingredients derived from marine by-products for cosmetics and discuss the possible activity of those active ingredients in promoting human beauty. In addition, this review also covers the prospect and challenge of using marine by-products toward the emerging concept of sustainable blue cosmetics.",

Opinions on the health and safety concerns of nonfood consumer products, such as cosmetics and their ingredients, consider the exposure of a \"common consumer,\" which may not account for occupational exposure of hairdressers. As a result, there is a parlous scenario in which serious safety concerns about occupational exposures are present. The purpose of this review is to compare the frequency of exposure to various types of hair cosmetic products among hairdressers and consumers. Database searches for this review yielded a total of 229 articles; 7 publications were ultimately included. The analysis showed that-dependent on the task-hairdressers were exposed 4 to 78 times more than consumers to a wide spectrum of hair cosmetic products used in their daily working life, ranging from shampoos, conditioners, oxidative and nonoxidative hair colors, to bleaching agents. The highest frequency was found for coloring hair with oxidative hair color. Consumer use frequency does not appear to be appropriate for representing hairdresser exposure. The current standards do not effectively address the occupational risks associated with hairdressers' use of cosmetics. The findings of this study should cause current risk-assessment procedures to be reconsidered.",

      "title": "A Biological Approach to Periorbital Aesthetics in Caucasian Females: A Review of the Literature.",
      "abstract": "The face plays an important role in human interactions, and the periorbital region is particularly important for recognition and attractiveness. There are several studies on the beauty of the periorbital region with a variety of methodologies, but few articles consider the attractiveness factors derived from evolutionary psychology such as symmetry, dimorphism, age and average, neoteny, and facial expression. The aim of this study was to identify periorbital attractiveness criteria in Caucasian females based on experimental studies and to interpret them in the light of studies on biological attractiveness factors. A review of literature was conducted with PubMed, the Cochrane Library Database, and EMBASE. Studies published after March 20, 2022, were analyzed, and no date limit was applied to reference papers. The search strategy was focused on 3 main concepts: attractiveness AND evaluation AND facial feature of periorbital region. A total of 780 articles were identified with this search strategy; 534 were excluded based on title and abstract and another 110 after full text assessment. Eighteen articles were finally included in the analysis. The main factors identified were an ascending intercanthal axis and eyebrow axis, a regular pretarsal plate and a well-defined upper lid crease, no scleral show, and an open eye fissure exposing the upper half of the iris. In our review we were able to identify objective anthropometric characteristics linked to biological attractiveness criteria that may be helpful in preoperative planning and assessment of the periorbital region of patients.",

      "abstract": "Ototoxicity refers to damage of sensory hair cells and functional hearing impairment following aminoglycosides exposure. Previously, we have determined that ferulic acid (FA) protected hair cells against serial concentrations of neomycin-induced ototoxic damage. The aim of the present study is to assess the mechanism and effects of FA on neomycin-induced hair cells loss and impact on mechanosensory-mediated behaviors alteration using transgenic zebrafish (pvalb3b: TagGFP). We first identified the optimal protective condition as pre/co-treatment method in early fish development. Pretreatment of the larvae with FA significantly protected against neomycin-induced hair cells loss through preventing neomycin passed through the cytoplasm of hair cells, and subsequently decreased reactive oxygen species production and TUNEL signals in 4 day post-fertilization (dpf) transgenic zebrafish larvae. Moreover, preservation of functional hair cells correlated directly with rescue of the altered swimming behavior, indicates FA pretreatment protects against neomycin ototoxic damage in 7-dpf transgenic zebrafish larvae. Together, our findings unravel the otoprotective role of FA as an effective agent against neomycin-induced ototoxic effects and offering the theoretical foundation for discovering novel candidates for hearing protection.",

      "abstract": "Striae distensae are a permanent skin defect that can affect 50%-90% of the population. The appearance of the changes resembles spindle-shaped skin bands. The skin in this area is wrinkled, thin and looks like a scar. Most often, the changes are found on the skin of the abdomen, buttocks, breasts, thighs, and back. The appearance of striae means that the skin in this area has no hair follicles, sebaceous, and sweat glands. This skin is flabby, not very elastic and, what is very characteristic, the pigmentation of the skin affected by striae is much lower than in healthy skin. Cosmetology in the 21st century is developing very dynamically, new technologies are being developed, new cosmetological devices are being created and combined with treatments that have been known for a long time. Today's science offers hope for people who have struggled with reducing striae for many years and nowadays, nothing is impossible.",

Exposure of the skin to environmental physical and chemical factors such as mechanical injuries, UV rays, air pollution, chemicals, etc. Leads to numerous damages to skin cells such as fibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, etc. The harmful effects of environmental factors on skin cells could lead to various skin diseases, chronic wounds, wrinkles, and skin aging. Hair is an essential part of the body, serving multiple functions such as regulating body temperature and protecting against external factors like dust (through eyelashes and eyebrows). It also reflects an individual's personality. Therefore, the need for new treatment methods for skin diseases and lesions and at the same time preserving the youth, freshness, and beauty of the skin has been highly noticed by experts. Exosomes are nanovesicles derived from cells that contain various biological compounds such as lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates. They are secreted by a variety of mammalian cells and even different plants. Exosomes are of great interest as a new therapeutic approach due to their stability, ability to be transported throughout the body, paracrine and endocrine effects, as well as the ability to carry various compounds and drugs to target cells.",

It identified that the brightness level was proportional to the power of 0.766 of L*. In the visual assessment, participants (N = 47) categorized 246 hair color samples into eight color hue groups aligned with the Munsell system. Hue judgment was conducted by visually comparing dyed hair tresses with natural black hair. Based on the L*, a*, and b* values of hair tresses and visual assessments thereof, we observed the ranges of hue categories for hair color alongside the brightness levels. Additionally, the differences between the Munsell hue names and the assessment results were compared. Predominantly influenced by the dark brown hair color, the neutral orientation was shifted to the first quadrant of the a*-b* plane. The study contributes to an understanding of human hair color perception and provides insights into color categorization and labeling, especially when the context is confined.",

      "title": "Regulation of stem cell fate by HSPGs: implication in hair follicle cycling.",
      "abstract": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are part of proteoglycan family. They are composed of heparan sulfate (HS)-type glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains covalently linked to a core protein. By interacting with growth factors and/or receptors, they regulate numerous pathways including Wnt, hedgehog (Hh), bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways. They act as inhibitor or activator of these pathways to modulate embryonic and adult stem cell fate during organ morphogenesis, regeneration and homeostasis. This review summarizes the knowledge on HSPG structure and classification and explores several signaling pathways regulated by HSPGs in stem cell fate. A specific focus on hair follicle stem cell fate and the possibility to target HSPGs in order to tackle hair loss are discussed in more dermatological and cosmeceutical perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as a promising treatment in aesthetic dermatology. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence for PRP applications in skin rejuvenation, hair restoration, wound healing, and fat grafting. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases and 13 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were selected for review. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to assess the quality of included studies. The reviewed studies consistently reported positive outcomes for PRP across various applications. In skin rejuvenation, significant improvements in collagen density and overall skin appearance were observed. For hair restoration, studies showed mean increases of 18-27.7 hairs/cm² in treated areas. PRP demonstrated efficacy in accelerating wound healing across various wound types, including chronic ulcers. In fat grafting, PRP was associated with improved graft survival and integration. Patient satisfaction was generally high across all applications. However, there was significant heterogeneity in PRP preparation methods and treatment protocols among studies. This systematic review provides evidence supporting the efficacy of PRP in aesthetic dermatology, particularly in skin rejuvenation, hair restoration, wound healing, and fat grafting. PRP demonstrates a favorable safety profile across applications. However, the variability in study designs and PRP protocols highlights the need for standardization. Future research should focus on large-scale randomized controlled trials with standardized protocols and longer follow-up periods to solidify the evidence base for PRP in aesthetic dermatology.",

Understanding the causes of these burns is crucial for prevention and appropriate care. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of causes and preventive measures related to pediatric facial burns caused by consumer products. Using data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2012 to 2021, we analyzed 130,461 cases of pediatric facial burns. Common causes included household items such as cleaning supplies, hot water, kitchen appliances, and health and beauty products. Differences in burn causes were observed between genders, with boys more prone to burns from welding equipment, gasoline, and grills, while girls were more susceptible to burns from hair curling equipment, candles, and health and beauty products. The mean age of children burned by different items varied, highlighting the need for age-appropriate preventive measures. The authors discuss the importance of caregiver education, safe storage practices, supervision, and clear communication in preventing pediatric facial burns. By raising awareness of potential burn sources and implementing preventive strategies, the incidence of pediatric facial burns can be significantly reduced.",

Exosomes have been studied in several medical fields including dermatology.

Because the growth and cycling of hair follicles are governed by interactions between hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs), a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for hair growth and cycling through exosomes may provide new insights into novel treatments for hair loss. In this review, we focused on the comprehensive knowledge and recent studies on exosomes in the field of hair development and regeneration. We classified exosomes of several cellular origins for the treatment of hair loss. Exosomes and their components, such as microRNAs, are promising drugs for effective hair loss treatment.",

      "title": "Can Plant Extracts Help Prevent Hair Loss or Promote Hair Growth? A Review Comparing Their Therapeutic Efficacies, Phytochemical Components, and Modulatory Targets.",
      "abstract": "This narrative review aims to examine the therapeutic potential and mechanism of action of plant extracts in preventing and treating alopecia (baldness). We searched and selected research papers on plant extracts related to hair loss, hair growth, or hair regrowth, and comprehensively compared the therapeutic efficacies, phytochemical components, and modulatory targets of plant extracts. These studies showed that various plant extracts increased the survival and proliferation of dermal papilla cells in vitro, enhanced cell proliferation and hair growth in hair follicles ex vivo, and promoted hair growth or regrowth in animal models in vivo. The hair growth-promoting efficacy of several plant extracts was verified in clinical trials. Some phenolic compounds, terpenes and terpenoids, sulfur-containing compounds, and fatty acids were identified as active compounds contained in plant extracts. The pharmacological effects of plant extracts and their active compounds were associated with the promotion of cell survival, cell proliferation, or cell cycle progression, and the upregulation of several growth factors, such as IGF-1, VEGF, HGF, and KGF (FGF-7), leading to the induction and extension of the anagen phase in the hair cycle. Those effects were also associated with the alleviation of oxidative stress, inflammatory response, cellular senescence, or apoptosis, and the downregulation of male hormones and their receptors, preventing the entry into the telogen phase in the hair cycle. Several active plant extracts and phytochemicals stimulated the signaling pathways mediated by protein kinase B (PKB, also called AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), Wingless and Int-1 (WNT), or sonic hedgehog (SHH), while suppressing other cell signaling pathways mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Thus, well-selected plant extracts and their active compounds can have beneficial effects on hair health. It is proposed that the discovery of phytochemicals targeting the aforementioned cellular events and cell signaling pathways will facilitate the development of new targeted therapies for alopecia.",

Some propose potential risks such as disrupted hair growth cycles or premature androgenetic alopecia (AGA), while others suggest benefits linked to improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced scalp blood circulation. However, despite these theoretical underpinnings, clinical evidence linking GLP-1 agonists to hair loss remains sparse.

      "abstract": "Hair loss affects millions globally, significantly impacting quality of life and psychological well-being. Despite its prevalence, effective strategies for promoting human hair growth remain elusive. By investigating congenital generalized hypertrichosis terminalis (CGHT), a rare genetic disorder characterized by excessive hair growth, we discover that chromatin deletions or an inverted duplication disrupt the topologically associating domain (TAD), leading to the upregulation of the potassium channel KCNJ2 in dermal fibroblasts. Mouse genetics demonstrate that KCNJ2-mediated membrane hyperpolarization in dermal fibroblasts promotes hair growth by enhancing fibroblasts Wnt signaling responses, involving a reduction in intracellular calcium levels. Notably, fibroblast membrane potential oscillates during the normal hair cycle, with hyperpolarization specifically associated with the growth phase. Inducing fibroblast membrane depolarization delays the growth phase, while KCNJ2-mediated hyperpolarization rescues hair loss in aging and androgenetic alopecia models. These results uncover a previously unrecognized role of fibroblast bioelectricity in tissue regeneration, offering novel therapeutic avenues for hair loss treatment.",

      "abstract": "Androgenic alopecia (AGA), also known as male pattern baldness, is one of the most common hair loss diseases worldwide. The main treatments of AGA include hair transplant surgery, oral medicines, and LDL laser irradiation, although no treatment to date can fully cure this disease. Animal models play important roles in the exploration of potential mechanisms of disease development and in assessing novel treatments. The present study describes androgen receptor (AR) in C57BL/6 mouse hair follicles that can be activated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and translocate to the nucleus. This led to the design of a mouse model of androgen-induced AGA in vivo and in vitro. DHT was found to induce early hair regression, hair miniaturization, hair density loss, and changes in hair morphology in male C57BL/6 mice. These effects of DHT could be partly reversed by the AR antagonist bicalutamide. DHT had similar effects in an ex vivo model of hair loss. Evaluation of histology, organ culture, and protein expression could explain the mechanism by which DHT delayed hair regrowth.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss, or alopecia, is a prevalent condition in modern society that imposes substantial mental and psychological burden on individuals. The types of hair loss, include androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and telogen effluvium; of them, androgenetic alopecia is the most common condition. Traditional treatment modalities mainly involve medical options, such as minoxidil, finasteride and surgical interventions, such as hair transplantation. However, these treatments still have many limitations. Therefore, exploring the pathogenesis of hair loss, specifically focusing on the development and regeneration of hair follicles (HFs), and developing new strategies for promoting hair regrowth are essential. Some emerging therapies for hair loss have gained prominence; these therapies include low-level laser therapy, micro needling, fractional radio frequency, platelet-rich plasma, and stem cell therapy. The aforementioned therapeutic strategies appear promising for hair loss management. In this review, we investigated the mechanisms underlying HF development and regeneration. For this, we studied the structure, development, cycle, and cellular function of HFs. In addition, we analyzed the symptoms, types, and causes of hair loss as well as its current conventional treatments. Our study provides an overview of the most effective regenerative medicine-based therapies for hair loss.",

We isolated acidic polysaccharides (WGBP-A2) and purified a RG-I type polysaccharide (WGBP-A2b) with a molecular weight of 44 kDa. Results showed that WGBP-A2 could significantly increase the contents of VEGF and HGF in the skin tissue of alopecia areata mice, decrease the contents of Inflammatory factors in the serum. On a cellular level, the expressions of p-p65 and p-IκBα, TNF-α and IL-1β in HUVECs treated with WGBP-A2b were down-regulated. The bioinformatic analysis showed that the inflammation signaling pathway was significantly changed. Its specific mechanism may be related to its regulating the expression of p-p65 p-IκBα, TNF-α and IL-1β proteins in the inflammation signaling pathway.",

      "abstract": "Hair follicle development and hair growth are regulated by multiple factors and multiple signalling pathways. The hair follicle, as an important skin appendage, is the basis for hair growth, and it has the functions of safeguarding the body, perceiving the environment and regulating body temperature. Hair growth undergoes a regular hair cycle, including anagen, catagen and telogen. A small amount of physiological shedding of hair occurs under normal conditions, always in a dynamic equilibrium. Hair loss occurs when the skin or hair follicles are stimulated by oxidative stress, inflammation or hormonal disorders that disrupt the homeostasis of the hair follicles. Numerous researches have indicated that oxidative stress is an important factor causing hair loss. Here, we summarize the signalling pathways and intervention mechanisms by which oxidative stress affects hair follicle development and hair growth, discuss existing treatments for hair loss via the antioxidant pathway and provide our own insights. In addition, we collate antioxidant natural products promoting hair growth in recent years and discuss the limitations and perspectives of current hair loss prevention and treatment.",

      "abstract": "β-Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) has shown promising effects on intestinal health, and it is extensively applied as an anti-aging and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic, due to its medicinal properties. The effects of NMN on the growth of mouse hair were observed after hair removal. The results indicated that NMN can reverse the state of hair follicle atrophy, hair thinning, and hair sparsity induced by dihydrotestosterone (DHT), compared to that of minoxidil. In addition, the action mechanisms of NMN promoting hair growth in cultured human dermal papilla cells (HDPCs) treated with DHT were investigated in detail. The incubation of HDPCs with DHT led to a decrease in cell viability and the release of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1Beta (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-α). It was found that NMN can significantly lower the release of inflammatory factors induced by DHT in HDPCs. HDPCs cells are protected from oxidative stress damage by NMN, which inhibits the NF-κB p65 inflammatory signaling pathway. Moreover, the levels of androgen receptor (AR), dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), and β-catenin in the HDPCs were assessed using PCR, indicating that NMN can significantly enhance the expression of VEGF, reduced IL-6 levels and suppress the expression of AR and DKK-1, and notably increase β-catenin expression in DHT-induced HDPCs.",

However, an integrated spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of embryonic skin has not yet been described and would be invaluable for studying skin-related diseases in humans. Here, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses are performed on skin samples of normal and hairless fetal pigs across four developmental periods. The cross-species comparison of skin cells illustrated that the pig epidermis is more representative of the human epidermis than mice epidermis. Moreover, Phenome-wide association study analysis revealed that the conserved genes between pigs and humans are strongly associated with human skin-related diseases. In the epidermis, two lineage differentiation trajectories describe hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and epidermal development. By comparing normal and hairless fetal pigs, it is found that the hair placode (Pc), the most characteristic initial structure in HFs, arises from progenitor-like OGN",

      "abstract": "Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) are among the most widely available resources and most frequently approved model systems used for studying adult stem cells. HFSCs are particularly useful because of their self-renewal and differentiation properties. Additionally, the cyclic growth of hair follicles is driven by HFSCs. There are high expectations for the use of HFSCs as favourable systems for studying the molecular mechanisms that contribute to HFSC identification and can be applied to hair loss therapy, such as the activation or regeneration of hair follicles, and to the generation of hair using a tissue-engineering strategy. A variety of molecules are involved in the networks that critically regulate the fate of HFSCs, such as factors in hair follicle growth and development (in the Wnt pathway, Sonic hedgehog pathway, Notch pathway, and BMP pathway), and that suppress apoptotic cues (the apoptosis pathway). Here, we review the life cycle, biomarkers and functions of HFSCs, concluding with a summary of the signalling pathways involved in HFSC fate for promoting better understanding of the pathophysiological changes in the HFSC niche. Importantly, we highlight the potential mechanisms underlying the therapeutic targets involved in pathways associated with the treatment of hair loss and other disorders of skin and hair, including alopecia, skin cancer, skin inflammation, and skin wound healing.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is a widespread health problem that affects numerous individuals and is associated with age, lack of sleep, stress, endocrine problems, and other problems. Caffeine exerts various pharmacological effects, particularly after ingestion. The caffeine-induced inhibition of phosphodiesterases can increase intracellular cAMP concentrations, ultimately resulting in stimulatory effects on cell metabolism and proliferation. Hence, caffeine has been confirmed to inhibit hair loss caused by premature termination of the hair growth phase. Adenosine also improves hair loss by stimulating hair growth and thickening hair shafts. However, further empirical evidence is required to comprehensively assess the efficacy of hair loss treatment and prevention using a formulation of caffeine and adenosine in specific proportions in shampoos.",

      "title": "Dexpanthenol Promotes Cell Growth by Preventing Cell Senescence and Apoptosis in Cultured Human Hair Follicle Cells.",
      "abstract": "Dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) is a precursor of vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) and is widely used for dietary supplements and topical applications. D-panthenol has long been used in hair care products for the purpose of anti-hair loss, its effects and the underlying mechanisms, however, were barely reported. In this study, the effects of D-panthenol on human hair follicle cells, including dermal papilla cells (hDPCs) and outer root sheath cells (hORSCs), were investigated. D-panthenol enhanced the cell viability, increasing the cellular proliferation marker Ki67 in cultured hDPCs. The markers for apoptosis (Caspase3/9) and cell senescence (p21/p16), reported to be expressed in aged or resting phase follicles, were significantly reduced by D-panthenol. Anagen-inducing factors (ALP; β-catenin; versican), which trigger or elongate the anagen phase, were stimulated by D-panthenol. On the other hand, D-panthenol reduced TGF-β1 expressions in both mRNA and protein levels. The expression of VEGF, which is important for peripheral blood vessel activation; was up-regulated by D-panthenol treatment. In cultured hORSCs, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced, while the mRNA expression of cell senescence markers (p21/p16) was significantly down-regulated. The expressions of both VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR) were up-regulated by D-panthenol. In conclusion, our data suggest that the hair growth stimulating activity of D-panthenol was exerted by increasing the cell viability, suppressing the apoptotic markers, and elongating the anagen phase in hair follicles.",

      "abstract": "Melatonin (MLT) is a circadian hormone that reportedly influences the development and cyclic growth of secondary hair follicles; however, the mechanism of regulation remains unknown. Here, we systematically investigated the role of MLT in hair regeneration using a hair depilation mouse model. We found that MLT supplementation significantly promoted hair regeneration in the hair depilation mouse model, whereas supplementation of MLT receptor antagonist luzindole significantly suppressed hair regeneration. By analysing gene expression dynamics between the MLT group and luzindole-treated groups, we revealed that MLT supplementation significantly up-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway-related genes. In-depth analysis of the expression of key molecules in the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway revealed that MLT up-regulated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in dermal papillae (DP), whereas these effects were facilitated through mediating Wnt ligand expression levels in the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Using a DP-HFSCs co-culture system, we verified that MLT activated Wnt/β-catenin signalling in DPs when co-cultured with HFSCs, whereas supplementation of DP cells with MLT alone failed to activate Wnt/β-catenin signalling. In summary, our work identified a critical role for MLT in promoting hair regeneration and will have potential implications for future hair loss treatment in humans.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is a complex and multi-factorial problem that is associated with significant psychological morbidity in women. Menopausal women represent a significant percentage of those affected, since the menopausal hormonal transition can be a contributing factor. A novel nutraceutical supplement has been specifically formulated with phytoactives to improve hair growth and quality in menopausal women (Nutrafol&reg; Women&rsquo;s Balance Capsules). The objective of this 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this oral supplement to promote hair growth in perimenopausal, menopausal, and postmenopausal women with self-perceived thinning. Subjects were randomized to the study supplement (n=40) or placebo (n=30). The primary endpoint was a statistically significant increase in the number of terminal and vellus hairs based on phototrichogram analysis. Daily intake of the nutraceutical supplement resulted in progressive and significant increase in terminal and total hair counts on days 90 (P&lt;0.01) and 180 (P&lt;0.01) compared to placebo. The vellus hair counts significantly increased for the active treatment group (P&lt;0.05) by day 180 while significantly decreasing for the placebo group subjects. Hair shedding progressively and significantly decreased for the active group compared to placebo, culminating in a reduction of 32.41% by day 180 (P&lt;0.01). The study supplement was well-tolerated.

      "abstract": "Pain, detected by nociceptors, is an integral part of injury, yet whether and how it can impact tissue physiology and recovery remain understudied. Here, we applied chemogenetics in mice to locally activate dermal TRPV1 innervations in naive skin and found that it triggered new regenerative cycling by dormant hair follicles (HFs). This was preceded by rapid apoptosis of dermal macrophages, mediated by the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). TRPV1 activation also triggered a macrophage-dependent induction of osteopontin (Spp1)-expressing dermal fibroblasts. The neuropeptide CGRP and the extracellular matrix protein Spp1 were required for the nociceptor-triggered hair growth. Finally, we showed that epidermal abrasion injury induced Spp1-expressing dermal fibroblasts and hair growth via a TRPV1 neuron and CGRP-dependent mechanism. Collectively, these data demonstrated a role for TRPV1 nociceptors in orchestrating a macrophage and fibroblast-supported mechanism to promote hair growth and enabling the efficient restoration of this mechano- and thermo-protective barrier after wounding.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss affects men and women of all ages. Myokines, which are mainly secreted by skeletal muscles during exercise, have numerous health benefits. VEGF, IGF-1, FGF and irisin are reprehensive myokines. Although VEGF, IGF-1 and FGF are positively associated with hair growth, few studies have researched the effects of irisin on hair growth. Here, we investigated whether irisin promotes hair growth using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo patch assays, as well as mouse models. We show that irisin increases proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mitochondrial membrane potential in human dermal papilla cells (hDPCs). Irisin activated the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, thereby upregulating Wnt5a, Wnt10b and LEF-1, which play an important role in hair growth. Moreover, irisin enhanced human hair shaft elongation. In vivo, patch assays revealed that irisin promotes the generation of new hair follicles, accelerates entry into the anagen phase, and significantly increases hair growth in C57BL/6 mice. However, XAV939, a Wnt/β-catenin signalling inhibitor, suppressed the irisin-mediated increase in hair shaft and hair growth. These results indicate that irisin increases hair growth via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and highlight its therapeutic potential in hair loss treatment.",

      "abstract": "Both alopecia areata (AA) and vitiligo share common pathogenesis involving, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-15 (IL-15) signalling pathways that activate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes. These shared mechanisms may explain why both diseases respond to currently available treatments (e.g. topical/systemic corticosteroid) and emerging treatment modalities. As compared with the speed of re-pigmentation in vitiligo lesions, the regeneration of pigmented terminal hair follicles in AA lesions appears fast in response to treatments targeting the inhibition of the Janus kinases (JAKs) and other kinases. We summarize the commonalities and differences between AA and vitiligo focusing on the treatment modalities, followed by recent findings associated with hair follicle stem cells (HFSC) in hair bulge (HBg) and melanocyte stem cells (McSC) in HBg and hair germ (HGm). We then discuss how HFSC and HGm-McSC are involved in the initiation of anagen phase, followed by pigmented terminal hair regrowth in the recovering AA lesions in association with immunology. We also discuss how HBg-McSC contribute to the migration of fully dendritic mature melanocytes into interfollicular epidermis and the equal distribution of melanin in recovering vitiligo lesions. Finally, we present four hypotheses to elucidate the delayed distribution of melanin by mature melanocytes in depigmented vitiligo lesions from the aspects of stem cell biology, as compared with quick hair recovery in AA: (1) McSC are less abundant than HFSC. (2) McSC require a long travel, whereas HFSC reside close to hair regeneration trigger point. (3) Keratinocyte scaffold to accept melanin is not well preserved, whereas scaffold for hair regrowth is well preserved. (4) Inhibitors targeting JAKs and other kinases have less direct effects on melanocyte proliferation and differentiation in vitiligo than hair regrowth in AA. Our review provides an overview of treatment modalities and bridges the gap between scientific advancement and clinical practice in AA and vitiligo management.",

In the hair follicle (HF) bulge of mammals, populations of slow-cycling stem cells regenerate the HF during cyclical rounds of anagen (growth), catagen (regression), and telogen (quiescence). Multipotent epidermal cells are also present in the HF above the bulge area, contributing to the formation and maintenance of sebaceous gland and upper and middle portions of the HF. Here, we report that the transcription factor KROX20 is enriched in an epidermal stem cell population located in the upper/middle HF. Expression analyses and lineage tracing using inducible Krox20-CreERT showed that Krox20-lineage cells migrate out of this HF region and contribute to the formation of the bulge in the HF, serving as ancestors of bulge stem cells. In vivo depletion of these cells arrests HF morphogenesis. This study identifies a marker for an epidermal stem cell population that is indispensable for hair homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "Ginger is an important cooking spice and herb worldwide, and scientific research has gradually confirmed the effect of ginger on preventing hair loss. Cedrol (CE) is a small sesquiterpene molecule in ginger and its external administration (EA) has shown hope in promoting hair growth, and alternative administration mode has become a potential treatment scheme to improve the efficacy of CE. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral administration (OA) and EA of CE on hair regeneration of C57BL/6 alopecia areata (AA) mice induced by cyclophosphamide (CP) and to clarify the potential hair growth mechanism of CE in AA model in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that CE-OA has a shorter hair-turning black time and faster hair growth rate, and can lessen hair follicle damage induced by CP and promote hair follicle cell proliferation. Its effect is superior to CE-EA. At the same time, CE can increase the cytokines IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-7 in the serum of mice, and decrease the expression of adhesion factors ICAM-1 and ELAM-1, thus alleviating the immunosuppression induced by CP. Mechanism research shows that CE regulates the JAK3/STAT3 signaling pathway, activates the Wnt3α/β-catenin germinal center, and ameliorates oxidative stress induced by CP, thus promoting the proliferation of hair follicle cells and reversing AA. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the anti-AA mechanism of CE-OA, indicating that CE can be used as raw material for developing oral hair growth drugs.",

Our analysis revealed that both combination therapies produced similar improvements in hair growth and had comparable safety profiles. Although the LDOM with finasteride/dutasteride group showed a greater average increase in hair width and density, these differences were not statistically significant.

      "title": "Hybrid hair follicle stem cell extracellular vesicles co-delivering finasteride and gold nanoparticles for androgenetic alopecia treatment.",
      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a non-fatal disease prevalent worldwide. However, mixed efficacy has been observed among different therapies for hair regrowth in AGA patients. Thus, a nano-platform with synergistic treatments based on a hybrid extracellular vesicle encapsulating gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and finasteride (Hybrid/Au@Fi) was constructed through membrane fusion between hair follicle stem cell (HFSC)-derived extracellular vesicles and liposomes. These hybrid vesicles (HVs) not only fuel hair regrowth by providing cellular signals in extracellular vesicles, but also improve storage stability, follicle retention, and drug encapsulation efficiency (EE%) for finasteride inhibiting 5α-reductase, and nano-size AuNPs that simulate low-level laser therapy (LLLT) with similar photothermal effects in vitro. The EE% of finasteride in these HVs reached 45.33%. The dual administration of these extracellular vesicles and finasteride showed a strong synergistic effect on HFSCs in vitro. In an AGA mouse model, once-daily topical Hybrid/Au@Fi (115.07 ± 0.32 nm, -7.50 ± 1.68 mV) gel led to a faster transition of hair follicles (HFs) from the catagen to the anagen, increased hair regrowth coverage, and higher quality of regrowth hair, compared to once-daily 5% minoxidil treatment. Compared to topical minoxidil, the multifaceted synergistic therapy of Hybrid/Au@Fi through topical administration offers a new option for intractable AGA patients with low side effects.",

      "title": "Mechanical forces across compartments coordinate cell shape and fate transitions to generate tissue architecture.",
      "abstract": "Morphogenesis and cell state transitions must be coordinated in time and space to produce a functional tissue. An excellent paradigm to understand the coupling of these processes is mammalian hair follicle development, which is initiated by the formation of an epithelial invagination-termed placode-that coincides with the emergence of a designated hair follicle stem cell population. The mechanisms directing the deformation of the epithelium, cell state transitions and physical compartmentalization of the placode are unknown. Here we identify a key role for coordinated mechanical forces stemming from contractile, proliferative and proteolytic activities across the epithelial and mesenchymal compartments in generating the placode structure. A ring of fibroblast cells gradually wraps around the placode cells to generate centripetal contractile forces, which, in collaboration with polarized epithelial myosin activity, promote elongation and local tissue thickening. These mechanical stresses further enhance compartmentalization of Sox9 expression to promote stem cell positioning. Subsequently, proteolytic remodelling locally softens the basement membrane to facilitate a release of pressure on the placode, enabling localized cell divisions, tissue fluidification and epithelial invagination into the underlying mesenchyme. Together, our experiments and modelling identify dynamic cell shape transformations and tissue-scale mechanical cooperation as key factors for orchestrating organ formation.",

      "abstract": "This post-hoc analysis of the ALLEGRO phase 2b/3 study (NCT03732807) evaluated the efficacy and safety of ritlecitinib, an oral Janus kinase 3/TEC family kinase inhibitor, in patients with alopecia totalis (AT) and alopecia universalis (AU). Patients aged ≥ 12 years with alopecia areata (AA) and ≥50% scalp hair loss received once-daily ritlecitinib 50 or 30 mg (± 4-week 200-mg loading dose) or placebo for 24 weeks. In a subsequent 24-week extension period, the ritlecitinib groups continued their doses and patients initially assigned to placebo switched to ritlecitinib (200/50 or 50 mg daily). In this analysis, clinician- and patient-reported hair regrowth outcomes were assessed at weeks 24 and 48 in four AA subgroups: AT/AU, AT, AU, and non-AT/AU. Safety was monitored throughout. Of the 718 randomized patients, 151 (21%) and 147 (20%) were defined as having AT or AU, respectively. At week 24, Severity of Alopecia Tool (SALT) score ≤20 (≤20% scalp hair loss) response rates were higher in the ritlecitinib-treated AT/AU, AT, and AU groups (7%-14%, 7%-21%, and 4%-10%, respectively) vs the placebo group (0% in the AT/AU, AT, and AU groups). The proportions of patients with a SALT score of ≤20 increased through week 48 (AT/AU, 13%-31%; AT, 11%-27%; AU, 6%-41%). Additionally, at week 24, 25%-43%, 32%-42%, and 12%-50% of patients with AT/AU, AT, and AU, respectively, who received ritlecitinib achieved a moderately or greatly improved response based on the Patient Global Impression of Change scale. Response rates generally increased through week 48 and were similar across AA subgroups. In patients with AT/AU, ritlecitinib was well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that of the overall AA population. Ritlecitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy, patient-reported improvement, and an acceptable safety profile in patients with AT and AU through week 48.

      "title": "Piperonylic Acid Promotes Hair Growth by Activation of EGFR and Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.",
      "abstract": "Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) are located at the bottom of the hair follicle and play a critical role in hair growth, shape, and cycle. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways are essential in promoting keratinocyte activation as well as hair follicle formation in DPCs. Piperonylic acid is a small molecule that induces EGFR activation in keratinocytes. However, the effects of piperonylic acid on DPCs in regard to the stimulation of hair growth have not been studied. In the present study, piperonylic acid was shown to activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in addition to the EGFR signaling pathway in DPCs. Piperonylic acid suppressed DKK1 expression, which presumably promoted the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus. In addition, piperonylic acid promoted cyclin D upregulation and cell growth and increased the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a DPC marker. In a clinical study, the group that applied a formulation containing piperonylic acid had a significantly higher number of hairs per unit area than the placebo group. These results identify piperonylic acid as a promising new candidate for hair loss treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ever since the discoveries that human hair follicles (HFs) display the functional peripheral equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, exhibit elements of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and even generate melatonin and prolactin, human hair research has proven to be a treasure chest for the exploration of neurohormone functions. However, growth hormone (GH), one of the dominant neurohormones of human neuroendocrine physiology, remains to be fully explored in this context. This is interesting since it has long been appreciated clinically that excessive GH serum levels induce distinct human skin pathology. Acromegaly, or GH excess, is associated with hypertrichosis, excessive androgen-independent growth of body hair, and hirsutism in females, while dysfunctional GH receptor-mediated signaling (Laron syndrome) is associated with alopecia and prominent HF defects. The outer root sheath keratinocytes have recently been shown to express functional GH receptors. Furthermore, and contrary to its name, recombinant human GH is known to inhibit female human scalp HFs' growth ex vivo, likely via stimulating the expression of the catagen-inducing growth factor, TGF-β2. These limited available data encourage one to systematically explore the largely uncharted role of GH in human HF biology to uncover nonclassical functions of this core neurohormone in human skin physiology.",

      "title": "Molecular Mechanisms of Hair Follicle Development.",
      "abstract": "Hair is an intricate biological structure that originates from hair follicles (HFs), which are complex mini-organs embedded in the skin. Each HF undergoes continuous cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen), driven by intricate signaling pathways and interactions between epithelial and mesodermal cells. The development of HFs requires the interplay of several key signaling pathways, including Wnt, Shh, Notch, and BMP. The Wnt pathway is primarily involved in induction, Shh is essential for early organogenesis and later stages of cytodifferentiation, Notch signaling governs the fate of HF stem cells, and BMP plays a role in cytodifferentiation. Hair health is closely associated with psychological well-being and personal distress. While hair loss (alopecia) does not impact biological health, it significantly affects social well-being. Therefore, a deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HF development is crucial for developing treatments for hair-related problems and improving hair health. This knowledge has led to significant advancements in therapeutic applications, particularly in treating hair loss disorders, enhancing wound healing, and developing cosmetic treatments. This paper aims to review the molecular mechanisms involved in HF development, with an emphasis on their potential impact on human health and well-being.",

      "abstract": "Oxytocin has various effects ranging from promoting labor in pregnant women to alleviating stress. Recently, we reported the hair growth-promoting effects of oxytocin in hair follicle organoids. However, its clinical application faces challenges such as rapid degradation in vivo and poor permeability due to its large molecular weight. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) agonists WAY267464 and LIT001 as alternatives to oxytocin on hair growth. Human dermal papilla (DP) cells were cultured in WAY267464 or LIT001-supplemented medium. The addition of WAY267464 and LIT001 increased the expression of hair growth-related genes in DP cells. We tested the hair growth-promoting effects of WAY267464 and LIT001 using hair follicle organoids in vitro and found that they significantly promoted hair follicle sprouting. Thus, our findings indicate that WAY267464 and LIT001 are potential hair growth agents and may encourage further research on the development of novel hair growth agents targeting OXTR in patients with alopecia.",

      "abstract": "GPR54, or KiSS-1R (Kisspeptin receptor), is key in puberty initiation and tumor metastasis prevention, but its role on hair follicles remains unclear. Our study shows that Gpr54 knockout (KO) accelerates hair cycle, synchronized hair regeneration and transplanted hair growth in mice. In Gpr54 KO mice, DPC (dermal papilla cell) activity is enhanced, with elevated expression of Wnts, VEGF, and IGF-1, which stimulate HFSCs. Gpr54 deletion also raises the number of CD34+ and Lgr5+ HFSCs. The Gpr54 inhibitor, kisspeptin234, promotes hair shaft growth in cultured mouse hair follicles and boosts synchronized hair regeneration in vivo. Mechanistically, Gpr54 deletion suppresses NFATC3 expression in DPCs and HFSCs, and decreases levels of SFRP1, a Wnt inhibitor. It also activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, promoting β-catenin nuclear localization and upregulating target genes such as Lef1 and ALP. Our findings suggest that Gpr54 deletion may accelerate the hair cycle and promote hair regeneration in mice by regulating the NAFTc3-SFRP1-Wnt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that Gpr54 could be a possible target for future hair loss treatments.",

Skin care activities are influenced by different factors, e.g., culture, knowledge, industrial developments and marketing activities. Therefore, various preferences, traditions, and behaviors exist worldwide including skin care of neonates and infants. The objective of this scoping review was to obtain an overview about the evidence of skin care activities in neonates and infants. Studies from 2010 were eligible if the population was (skin) healthy neonates and infants; if the concept was skin care interventions; and if the context was at home, in a community setting, in a pediatric outpatient service, or in a hospital. We searched for the literature via OVID in MEDLINE and Embase, in the Cochrane Library, in trial registries and for gray literature.",

      "title": "Gray Hair: From Preventive to Treatment.",
      "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable natural process, with gray hair being one of its most visible signs. Hair graying holds psychosocial importance and is an excellent model for studying human pigmentation and aging in an accessible mini-organ. This phenomenon results from decreased melanin production in hair follicles, influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Gray hair often poses aesthetic concerns and can be accelerated by environmental stressors, lifestyle choices, and nutritional deficiencies. Given the variation in onset and prevalence of gray hair, this study explores the underlying biological factors-namely, genetics, oxidative stress, and hormonal changes-to inform better prevention and treatment strategies. Recent advancements in prevention and treatment, such as topical melanin stimulants, antioxidants, dietary supplements, and low-level laser therapy (LLLT), offer promising approaches to managing gray hair. Understanding gray hair comprehensively-encompassing biological, psychological, and social dimensions-provides valuable insights into the aging process and can enhance overall well-being while addressing the stigma associated with aging. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that while graying correlates with certain health conditions, its primary significance is physiological rather than pathological. This understanding is essential for healthcare providers and the public to approach graying with scientific objectivity rather than social prejudice.",

      "title": "Dermatological adverse effects of hair dye use: A narrative review.",
      "abstract": "Hair dyeing is a popular practice dating back to ancient Egyptian times. Initially, hair dye use was restricted to concealing grey and white hairs of the elderly population. However, in recent times, its use is common among the younger generation as a fashion statement. Hair dye contact dermatitis is a common dermatological condition encountered by dermatologists. It is a delayed type of hypersensitivity reaction that commonly affects the scalp and the vicinity of hair line and neck. Para-phenylenediamine (PPD), a synthetic aromatic amine is the most common allergen specifically implicated in hair dye contact dermatitis. Para-phenylenediamine was announced as the allergen of the year in 2006 by the American Contact Dermatitis Society. Contact allergy to para-phenylenediamine can occur in 0.1-2.3% of the general population. Epicutaneous patch testing is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of hair dye contact dermatitis. However, para-phenylenediamine carries a risk of cross-sensitivity and co-sensitization to other allergens. Apart from contact dermatitis, hair dye use is also associated with various other cutaneous adverse effects such as pigmentary changes, hair loss, skin malignancies and autoimmune disorders. Due to the various adverse effects associated with hair dye use, it is prudent to look for safer alternatives to allergenic hair dyes. In this article, we review the epidemiology, cutaneous and systemic adverse effects associated with hair dye use, patch testing, preventive strategies to minimize the risk of hair dye contact dermatitis, and treatment aspects.",

      "abstract": "NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN, formerly known as neurofibromatosis type 2) is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with the growth of bilateral schwannomas on the cochleo-vestibular nerves and meningiomas. NF2-SWN is caused by pathogenic variations in the NF2, moesin-ezrin-radixin-like (MERLIN) tumour suppressor gene. The mostly benign tumours can cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and balance dysfunction. Outside the inner ear, tumours grow on other intra-cranial nerves, leading to further neurological issues and shortened life-expectancy. Here we re-evaluate some historic cases from our human temporal bone collection, and we review similar instances from the literature to highlight the structural and functional effects of such tumours on the cochlea and vestibular organs. Tumour growth is associated with the remodelling of sensory and ion-transporting epithelia, the loss of afferent neurons and hair cells, and signs of fluid dysregulation. These cases demonstrate the aggressive nature of this disease and the difficulties of surgically excising the bilateral tumours. They also emphasise the need for novel therapies that can slow or prevent tumour growth to preserve sensory function in people living with NF2-SWN.",

This class of compounds can increase the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and thus have the potential to be used as performance enhancing agents in sports. The purpose of this study was to investigate the detection of FG-4592 and metabolites in equine plasma and mane hair following a multiple dose oral administration to two Thoroughbred racehorses, to identify the best analytical targets for doping control laboratories. Urine samples were also analysed, and the results compared to previously published urine data. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry was used for metabolite identification in urine and plasma. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used for full sample analysis of urine, plasma and hair samples and generation of urine and plasma profiles. FG-4592 and a mono-hydroxylated metabolite were detected in plasma. FG-4592 was detected with the greatest abundance and gave the longest duration of detection, up to 312 h post-administration, and would be the recommended target in routine doping samples. FG-4592 was detected in all mane hair samples collected post-administration, up to 166 days following the final dose, showing extended detection can be achieved with this matrix. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of FG-4592 and metabolites in equine plasma and hair samples. Urine results were consistent with the previously published data, with FG-4592 offering the best target for detection and longest detection periods.",

      "abstract": "Grey hair, a common ageing-associated phenomenon in humans, is mainly attributed to the damage of melanocytes and the absence of melanin. Grey hair has long been treated with traditional medicine, and new research has shown that various plant-derived monomers can increase tyrosinase activity and melanogenesis, indicating that they may have therapeutic value in curing grey hair. In this study, we outlined the role of melanin and pigmentation during hair growth and collected various medicinal plant monomers with the potential value of grey hair reversal. Many active ingredients from medicinal plants, such as fraxinol, tribuloside, morin and naringenin, can upregulate melanogenesis and tyrosinase activity through different signalling pathways. Some of them can promote melanosome quantity, maturation and transportation as well. Monomers isolated from medicinal plants may act as stimulators of melanogenesis. Many plant-derived monomers perform as activators that upregulate melanin synthesis and tyrosinase activity through different signalling pathways. They are of great research value for the treatment of hair greying. Moreover, to further improve experimental effect, safety and reliability, a systematic and comprehensive evaluation system needs to be established in the future before studying their clinical efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Socioeconomic disadvantage during childhood predicts an increased risk for mental health problems across the life span. Socioeconomic disadvantage shapes multiple aspects of children's proximal environments and increases exposure to chronic stressors. Drawing from multiple literatures, we propose that childhood socioeconomic disadvantage may lead to adaptive changes in the regulation of stress response systems including the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These changes, in turn, affect the development of prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuitry responsible for top-down control over cognitive and emotional processes. Translational findings indicate that chronic stress reduces dendritic complexity and spine density in the medial PFC and anterior cingulate cortex, in part through altered HPA axis regulation. Socioeconomic disadvantage has frequently been associated with reduced gray matter in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC and anterior cingulate cortex and lower fractional anisotropy in the superior longitudinal fasciculus, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus during middle childhood and adolescence. Evidence of socioeconomic disparities in hair cortisol concentrations in children has accumulated, although null findings have been reported. Coupled with links between cortisol levels and reduced gray matter in the PFC and anterior cingulate cortex, these results support mechanistic roles for the HPA axis and these PFC circuits. Future longitudinal studies should simultaneously consider multiple dimensions of proximal factors, including cognitive stimulation, while focusing on epigenetic processes and genetic moderators to elucidate how socioeconomic context may influence the HPA axis and PFC circuitry involved in cognitive and emotional control. These findings, which point to modifiable factors, can be harnessed to inform policy and more effective prevention strategies.",

Physical examination findings similar to systemic sclerosis may be seen. Therefore, it may mimic this disease as misleading. A 43-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with a pre-diagnosis of systemic sclerosis complaint of skin hardening up to the ankle. In the first physical examination, there were wrinkles and thinning of the lip, suggesting systemic sclerosis in the facial appearance. On her capillaroscopy, there was tortuosity and an old focus of microhemorrhage. She had a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic osteomyelitis. When all symptoms, clinical findings, and antibody results were combined, it was thought that the patient might have WS. WS was diagnosed with homozygous c.2221 C>P p.R741*(rs763089663) positive in genetic analysis. It is known that WS creates a predisposition to malignancies, and most patients die secondary to malignancies. Therefore, early diagnosis becomes essential. Early diagnosis is of vital importance both to prevent complications and to delay treatment. In particular, systemic sclerosis-like findings of this syndrome may cause delays in diagnosis. For this reason, small clues suggesting WS in the clinic should be well known and well defined.",

The rice bran oil (RBO), defatted rice bran extract (DFRB), and rice husk (H) were determined for in vitro hair revitalization in melanin production, nitric oxide (NO) secretion, and steroid 5α-reductase inhibition. The results indicated that BB4CMU-RBO with high contents of iron, zinc, and free fatty acids showed a comparable induction of melanin production on melanocytes (130.18 ± 9.13% of control) to the standard drug theophylline with no significant difference (",

      "abstract": "Werner syndrome (WS) is an accelerated ageing disease caused by multiple mutations in the gene encoding the Werner DNA helicase (WRN). The major clinical features of WS include wrinkles, grey hair, osteoporosis, and metabolic phenomena such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and fatty liver, and resemble those seen in normal ageing, but occur earlier, in middle age. Defective DNA repair resulting from mutations in WRN explain the majority of the clinical features of WS, but the underlying mechanisms driving the larger metabolic dysfunction remain elusive. Recent studies in animal models of WS and in WS patient cells and blood samples suggest the involvement of impaired mitophagy, NAD+ depletion, and accumulation of damaged mitochondria in metabolic dysfunction. This mini-review summarizes recent progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction in WS, with the involvement of DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy reduction, stem cell impairment, and senescence. Future studies on NAD+ and mitophagy may shed light on potential therapeutic strategies for the WS patients.",

      "abstract": "The popular formula Qiye Qingnian Powder, prescribed by Hua Tuo (BC145 - 208), is believed to \"remove three kinds of worms, be conducive to the five main organs, keep fit, and prevent one's hair from turning gray\". It is a representative formula in terms of \"removing worms to prolong life\" in traditional Chinese medicine. This paper focuses on \"Qiye\" in this formula, which plays an important role in removing worms, reviews its place in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Tibetan medicine, and Ayurvedic medicine and compares the concept of \"removing worms\" in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. It was found that the name and efficacy of Bhallātaka in Ayurvedic medicine is related to \"Qiye\". It was also indicated that by comparing the concept of \"worms\" and the understanding of \"removing worms\" in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine, in the theory of traditional medicines worms are the causative factor of diseases. Traditional Chinese medicine has rich connotations which involved medicinal concepts of Buddhism and Taoism and the idea of \"removing worms to prolong life\" is a unique contribution of traditional Chinese medicine to human health.",

      "title": "Delivering a geriatric OSCE station in times of Covid-19 using makeup artistry.",
      "abstract": "In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, people over 65 or suffering from certain conditions were deemed at high risk and asked to isolate themselves. This led to the simulated patient (SP) program at the University of Bern being depleted of middle-aged and elderly SP. Meanwhile, an OSCE had to be delivered using adapted cases that minimized physical contact between candidates and SP. Short of suitable cases at such short notice, the case of an elderly patient with postural instability had to be added to the exam blueprint. With elderly SP off the roster, it was decided to use makeup effects to achieve visual authenticity. A combination of wigs (grey hair, hairdo), 3D Probondo transfers (forehead wrinkles), old age stipple (crow's feet), and colouring (age spots) were used to achieve the old-age effects, while SPs wore scarves to cover their neckline. The lower face was covered with protective face masks in accordance with the exam's Covid-19 hygiene protocol. Case-related feedback from candidates and examiners was analysed for any direct or indirect remark attributable to the ageing effects. As no comment touched upon the subject of the appearance of age, this was interpreted as success, as any distracting effect from the SPs' appearance in this regard would surely have prompted remarks or even complaints. The SPs' feedback revealed how applying the ageing effects helped them adopt the octogenarian's role. This report explains how SP in their fifties were made fit for an octogenarian's case in an OSCE using makeup effects. The effort required for the ageing simulation was considerable, but it is hoped that in future, with more planning time, the amount of effort required can be reduced. The feedback obtained from the candidates suggest the appearance of SPs was not experienced as a distraction, which was the primary objective of this exercise. Adapting our approach to their own contexts allows educators to include cases with elderly patients in their OSCE that cannot be re-written for younger SP, so long as Covid-19 prevents elderly SP from participating.",

Brittle nail syndrome, onychomycosis, paronychia, nail psoriasis, longitudinal melanonychia, Beau's lines, onychomadesis and retronychia are common nail disorders seen in clinical practice. These conditions stem from infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic and traumatic aetiologies. Though each nail condition presents with its own distinct characteristics, the clinical findings may overlap between different conditions, resulting in misdiagnosis and treatment delays. Patients can present with nail plate changes (e.g. hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, pitting), discolouration, pain and inflammation. The diagnostic work-up of nail disease should include a detailed history and clinical examination of all 20 nail units. Dermoscopy, diagnostic imaging and histopathologic and mycological analyses may be necessary for diagnosis. Nail findings concerning for malignancy should be promptly referred to a dermatologist for evaluation and biopsy. Nail disease management requires a targeted treatment approach. Treatments include topical and/or systemic medications, discontinuation of offending drugs or surgical intervention, depending on the condition. Patient education on proper nail care and techniques to minimize further damage to the affected nails is also important. This article serves to enhance familiarity of the most common nail disorders seen in clinical practice. It will highlight the key clinical manifestations, systematic approaches to diagnosis and treatment options for each nail condition to improve diagnosis and management of nail diseases, as well as patient outcomes.Key messagesNail disease is not only a cosmetic issue, as nail changes can indicate the presence of a serious underlying systemic disease, infection or malignancy.Nail pain and changes associated with NP are physically and emotionally distressing and may contribute to functional impairment and diminished quality of life.LM is a hallmark sign of subungual melanoma and this finding warrants further investigation to rule out malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Surgical fixation of distal femur fractures in geriatric patients is an evolving topic. Unlike hip fractures, treatment strategies for distal femur fractures are ill-defined and lack substantive high-quality evidence. With an increasing incidence and an association with significant morbidity and mortality, it is essential to understand existing treatment options and their supporting evidence. Current fixation methods include the use of either retrograde intramedullary nails, or plate and screw constructs. Due to the variability in fracture patterns, the unique anatomy of the distal femur, and the presence or absence or pre-existing implants, decision-making as to which method to use can be challenging. Recent literature has sought to describe the advantages and disadvantages of each, however, there is currently no consensus on a standard of care, and little randomized evidence is available that directly compares intramedullary nails with plating. Future randomized studies comparing intramedullary nails with plating constructs are necessary in order to develop a standard of care based on injury characteristics.",

Subungual hematoma is diagnosed clinically and treated with observation or nail trephination. Nail bed lacerations are treated by removal of the nail and repair of the nail bed. Distal interphalangeal joint dislocations typically occur dorsally and result from hyperextension or hyperflexion during sports or because of accidental trauma. Management primarily involves closed reduction and splinting; however, surgical intervention might be necessary for complex cases. Distal phalanx fractures are most often minimally displaced and amenable to closed reduction and splinting; open and intra-articular fractures involving more than one-third of the articular surface require referral to a hand surgeon. Mallet finger comprises rupture of the extensor digitorum tendon or avulsion from the adjacent distal phalanx, inhibiting distal interphalangeal joint extension, and typically heals after 6 to 8 weeks of constant immobilization. Jersey finger involves similar injuries to the flexor digitorum profundus tendon but necessitates referral for surgical repair to restore function.",

      "abstract": "Hip fractures are a leading cause of hospitalisation in elderly patients, representing an increasing socioeconomic problem arising from demographic changes, considering the increased number of elderly people in our countries. Adequate peri-operative treatment is essential to decrease mortality rates and avoid complications. Modern management should involve a coordinated multidisciplinary approach, early surgery, pain treatment, balanced fluid therapy, and prevention of delirium, to improve patients' functional and clinical outcomes. The operative treatment for intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures is intramedullary nail or sliding/dynamic hip screw (DHS) on the basis of the morphology of the fracture. In the case of neck fractures, total hip replacement (THR) or hemiarthroplasty are recommended. However, several topics remain debated, such as the optimum thromboprophylaxis to reduce venous thromboembolism or the use of bone cement. Postoperatively, patients can benefit from early mobilisation and geriatric multidisciplinary care. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a prolonged time to operation with a subsequent increased complication rate have burdened frail and elderly patients with hip fractures. Future studies are needed with the aim to investigate better strategies to improve nutrition, postoperative mobility, to clarify the role of home-based rehabilitation, and to identify the ideal analgesic treatment and adequate tools in case of patients with cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Gel manicures have become part of a popular personal care service in the last two decades due to increased longevity of the polish and the added strength to the nail plate. Prolonged exposure to nail ultraviolet (UV) lamps is required to cure the gel polish. Despite the increased use of UV nail lamps, there is limited consensus in the literature on the risk of skin malignancy associated with UV nail lamps. The objective of this article was to provide a systematic review of the risk of skin malignancy associated with the use of UV nail lamps and to synthesize evidence-based recommendations on their safe usage. A systematic review of the literature was conducted on the databases, Medline and Embase, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 2,331 non-duplicate articles. Nine were ultimately included, of which three were case reports, one was a cross-sectional study, and five were experimental studies. The risk of bias per the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines was high or unclear, likely due to the number of case reports included. Prolonged and repeated exposure to UV nail lamps may pose a low risk of skin cancer. It is important to note that the available evidence is weak, and patients should be informed about the limited data to make their own decisions. Dermatologists and other healthcare providers should be updated with the latest evidence to address patients' concerns about gel manicures and suggest practices which can effectively reduce the risk of cutaneous malignancy associated with gel manicures, such as the use of UV-blocking gloves or properly applied sunscreens.",

In this review, we describe the various clinical features of nail changes associated with diabetes, which can be broadly divided into infections, vascular changes, neuropathic manifestations and miscellaneous changes, although there is overlap between them. There is no pathognomonic nail alteration, but it is important for clinicians to be aware of the potential nail manifestations in diabetes as they can facilitate investigations and thereby early diagnosis of diabetes, resulting in holistic management of the patient.",

      "abstract": "As the world's population of adults greater than 60 years old continues to increase, it is important to manage nail disorders that may impact their daily lives. Nail disorders may have significant impact on quality of life due to decreased functionality, extreme pain, or social embarrassment. In this review, we discuss nail disorders affecting older patients, including physiologic, traumatic, drug-induced, infectious, environmental, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions. Diagnosis of these conditions involves a detailed history, physical examination of all 20 nails, and depending on the condition, a nail clipping or biopsy and/or diagnostic imaging. Nails grow even more slowly in older adults compared to younger individuals, and therefore it is important for accurate diagnosis, and avoidance of inappropriate management and delay of treatment. Increased awareness of nail pathologies may help recognition and management of nail conditions in older adults.",

Various nail cosmetics are available, such as nail polish along with its variants like shellacs, finishes, artificial nails, adornments, and nail polish removers. Nail cosmetics serve aesthetic as well as therapeutic purposes, with the end result being smooth, attractive nails. Nail grooming procedures have evolved from a basic manicure to many other advanced procedures like gel nails, nail tattooing, etc. Although a majority of nail cosmetics are considered safe, they may have potential complications, including allergic and irritant reactions, infections, and mechanical effects. The majority of the procedures related to nail enhancement are not performed by dermatologists but by beauticians with inadequate or no knowledge of the nail's anatomy and functions. The hygiene at the so-called nail-salons/beauty parlours is not standardized, leading to acute complications like paronychia and nail dystrophy following matrix injury. The use of nail cosmetics has become widespread, making it essential for dermatologists to be aware of the nail care products, aesthetic procedures pertaining to nails, and related adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Subungual keratoacanthoma (SKA) is a rare benign nail bed tumor in dogs, and its radiographic characteristics have not been reported based on the authors' review of the literature. The purpose of this multicenter, retrospective, observational, descriptive study was to describe the radiographic features of SKA in dogs. Twelve dogs for a total of 12 digits with histologically confirmed SKA met the inclusion criteria. The radiographs of the manus or pes were reviewed by two veterinary radiologists and one veterinarian. The radiology reports were interpreted based on a consensus. In six dogs, there was lysis of both the middle phalanx (P2) and the distal phalanx (P3), whereas in the other six dogs, there was only lysis of P3. In all dogs with osteolysis of P2, the lysis involved the distal articular surface. Osteolysis of P3 was more severe in the ungual process than in the ungual crest in all dogs. The margins of the lytic regions of P2 and P3 were well defined and smoothly marginated in most dogs. Expansile changes in the P3 crest were observed in 83.3% (10/12 dogs), and the nail of the affected digit was enlarged and deformed in 91.6% (11/12 dogs). In summary, the radiographic features of canine SKA include severe pressure resorption of the P3 ungual process, expansile change of the P3 ungual crest, and nail enlargement and deformation. With these radiographic features, SKA should be considered as a differential diagnosis.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and treatment of nail melanoma: a review of the clinicopathologic, dermoscopic, and genetic characteristics.",
      "abstract": "Nail melanoma (NM) is an important differential diagnosis in patients with longitudinal melanonychia. However, diagnosis is often challenging as it is difficult to differentiate from other pigmented nail disorders. The main challenge for diagnosis is obtaining adequate nail matrix biopsy specimens for histopathological assessment. Furthermore, the histopathological changes in the early stages of NM are subtle and contribute to a delay in diagnosis and care. Therefore, the integration of clinical and histopathological analyses is essential. Clinical and dermoscopic features, such as a broadened width of asymmetric bands in an irregular pattern, with multicolour pigmentation, periungual pigmentation, and continuous growth, are features that support the diagnosis of NM. The essential histological features that must be assessed are cellular morphology, architectural features, melanocyte density, and inflammatory changes. The reported mutations in NMs were BRAF (0-43%), NRAS (0-31%), KIT (0-50%), NF1 (0-50%), and GNAQ (0-25%). Surgery is the primary treatment for NM. The recommended treatment for in situ or minimally invasive NM is functional surgery, but cases with suspected bone invasion should be treated with amputation. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are indicated for advanced stages of NM. This review summarizes the updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of NM.",

      "abstract": "Nail dermoscopy (onychoscopy) is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating diseases in the nail apparatus. It is non-invasive, allowing clinicians to prioritize particular nails for biopsy. Thus, it can improve diagnostic accuracy and expedite treatment. Evaluating inflammatory nail disorders using onychoscopy is a relatively new approach to clinical assessment and has the potential to augment clinical care. This review highlights key dermoscopic features of major inflammatory nail disorders, including trachyonychia, nail psoriasis, nail lichen planus, onychotillomania, nail lichen striatus and allergic contact dermatitis due to artificial nails. It also illustrates their management and differential diagnoses, including onychomycosis, onycholysis, nail dystrophy due to systemic amyloidosis and malignant nail tumours. Limitations of this review included the low amount of literature on this topic and non-standardized terminology used among research-ers. As onychoscopy is a relatively new technique, further studies and standardization of terminology are warranted to consolidate the role of dermoscopy in evaluating inflammatory nail disorders.",

      "abstract": "Onychomycosis, a common fungal nail infection, can present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges in special populations including the elderly, children, individuals with diabetes, immunocompromised patients, and those with compromised organ function or psoriasis. These groups face increased susceptibility due to factors such as impaired immunity, vascular insufficiency, comorbidities, and altered nail morphology. Despite its often-benign perception, untreated onychomycosis in these populations can lead to complications, including secondary infection, ulceration, and systemic spread. Accurate diagnosis, requiring mycological confirmation, is important as clinical features may overlap with non-fungal nail disorders. Treatment must be tailored to individual risk profiles, with careful consideration of drug efficacy, safety, and potential interactions with comorbidities and polypharmacy. While systemic antifungals remain the standard for moderate-to-severe disease, their use may be limited by comorbidities, such as renal and hepatic impairment, and drug interactions. Topical antifungals such as efinaconazole, tavaborole, and ciclopirox can be considered for mild to moderate onychomycosis. This review provides an in-depth overview of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of onychomycosis in special populations, underscoring the importance of individualized care to improve outcomes and reduce recurrence.",

Known for their versatility in formulating various consumer, health care, and industrial products, acrylates also have come under scrutiny for their potential to cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). Allergic contact dermatitis to acrylates previously was largely occupational in nature, but the expanded use of acrylates in products ranging from nail cosmetics to medical devices has increasingly brought this allergy to the general population. Herein, we discuss the chemistry and allergenicity of acrylates and highlight common sources of exposure, clinical presentations, pertinent considerations for patch testing, and tips for the management/prevention of acrylate ACD. We hope to emphasize the shifting trend of exposure sources from the workplace to consumers, underlining the need for increased vigilance from physicians. Collaborative efforts among health care providers and patient education about allergen avoidance strategies are essential to mitigate potential complications arising from acrylate sensitization.",

This study examines occupational risks of inhaling organic dust in the working environment of Podologists (PDL) through their erythrocyte morphologies. Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to determine fatigue symptoms of the participants related to occupational exposures. 25 PDL and 26 control subjects were compared. Peripheral smear technique was used to identify erythrocyte morphologies. The results demonstrated that physical, mental, total fatigue levels, and erythrocyte anomaly amounts of the individuals in the PDL group were higher (p < .05). Findings also revealed that fatigue effectively formed Hypochromic, Stomatocytes, Dacrocytes, Elliptocytes, Spherocytes, and Ovalocytes.

An update of these guidelines and literature search was planned every 5 years, given the clinical, molecular and therapeutic advances, including the use of biologic therapies. We present here updated guidelines that have been developed by a reorganized multidisciplinary group of international experts after a systematic review of recent literature, discussions and consensus reached at an expert conference held in June 2023. The guidelines provide summarized evidence and expert-based recommendations that aim to guide clinicians in the management of these rare and often complex diseases. These guidelines consist of two sections. Part one is reported elsewhere. Here, Part two covers the management of complications (eye, ear-nose-throat, pruritus, pain, cutaneous infections, vaccinations, growth failure and nutritional deficiency, hair and nail anomalies, reaction to hot and cold climates, physical limitations, comorbidities) and the particularities of the neonatal period and Netherton syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Onychophagia, commonly referred to as nail biting, is a chronic condition that is repetitive and compulsive in nature, and generally seen in children and young adults. Multiple factors play a role in the development of nail biting, ranging from genetic components to underlying psychiatric conditions. Complications of chronic, compulsive nail biting range from obvious distortion of the nail bed unit to ungual and oral infection. Dental hygiene is typically less well-maintained in patients with nail-biting disorders, and teeth may become chipped or notched and gums many become inflamed. Treatment of nail biting involves a multidisciplinary team that provides social, psychiatric, dermatologic, and dental care. Treatment ranges from psychotherapy modalities to medication trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and N-acetylcysteine. Proper nail hygiene remains a mainstay in the prevention of the complications of chronic nail biting. Additional supportive measures include the support of self-motivational novels and television episodes that help children learn coping mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Dyskeratosis congenital (DC) is the first genetic syndrome described among telomeropathies. Its classical phenotype is characterized by the mucocutaneous triad of reticulated pigmentation of skin lace, nail dystrophy and oral leukoplakia. The clinical presentation, however, is heterogeneous and serious clinical complications include bone marrow failure, hematological and solid tumors. It may also involve immunodeficiencies, dental, pulmonary and liver disorders, and other minor complication. Dyskeratosis congenita shows marked genetic heterogeneity, as at least 14 genes are responsible for the shortening of telomeres characteristic of this disease. This review discusses clinical characteristics, molecular genetics, disease evolution, available therapeutic options and differential diagnosis of dyskeratosis congenita to provide an interdisciplinary and personalized medical assessment that includes family genetic counseling.",

These products are not regulated by the United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and hence there is no centralized database listing current products. The goal of this study was to document and examine the labeling and marketing methods of these products. Methods Supplements including the words \"glow,\" \"beauty,\" \"skin,\" \"hair,\" or \"nails\" on the label were included in the sample. Seven stores within a 3-mile radius were included. Results A total of 176 unique supplements were identified. It was found that most products lacked independent testing; many utilized outdated daily values (DVs) of nutrients. Some had confusing dosing instructions, and most products made health-related marketing claims. Conclusion Dermatologists and primary care providers should be aware of the marketing claims commonly made by these products. Patients should be educated that these claims are generally not verified by independent testing agencies, the U.S. FDA, or by high-quality randomized control trials.",

      "abstract": "Understanding changes in oral flora during pregnancy, its association to maternal health, and its implications to birth outcomes is essential. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library in May 2020 (updated search in April and June 2021), and conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to assess the followings: (1) oral microflora changes throughout pregnancy, (2) association between oral microorganisms during pregnancy and maternal oral/systemic conditions, and (3) implications of oral microorganisms during pregnancy on birth outcomes. From 3983 records, 78 studies were included for qualitative assessment, and 13 studies were included in meta-analysis. The oral microflora remains relatively stable during pregnancy; however, pregnancy was associated with distinct composition/abundance of oral microorganisms when compared to postpartum/non-pregnant status. Oral microflora during pregnancy appears to be influenced by oral and systemic conditions (e.g. gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia, etc.). Prenatal dental care reduced the carriage of oral pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus mutans). The Porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque was more abundant in women with preterm birth. Given the results from meta-analyses were inconclusive since limited studies reported outcomes on the same measuring scale, more future studies are needed to elucidate the association between pregnancy oral microbiota and maternal oral/systemic health and birth outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Oral microbiota are among the most diverse in the human body. More than 700 species have been identified in the mouth, and new sequencing methods are allowing us to discover even more species. The anatomy of the oral cavity is different from that of other body sites. The oral cavity has mucosal surfaces (the tongue, the buccal mucosa, the gingiva, and the palate), hard tissues (the teeth), and exocrine gland tissue (major and minor salivary glands), all of which present unique features for microbiota composition. The connection between oral microbiota and diseases of the human body has been under intensive research in the past years. Furthermore, oral microbiota have been associated with cancer development. Patients suffering from periodontitis, a common advanced gingival disease caused by bacterial dysbiosis, have a 2-5 times higher risk of acquiring any cancer compared to healthy individuals. Some oral taxa, especially Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, have been shown to have carcinogenic potential by several different mechanisms. They can inhibit apoptosis, activate cell proliferation, promote cellular invasion, induce chronic inflammation, and directly produce carcinogens. These microbiota changes can already be seen with potentially malignant lesions of the oral cavity. The causal relationship between microbiota and cancer is complex. It is difficult to accurately study the impact of specific bacteria on carcinoma development in humans. This review focuses on the elucidating the interactions between oral cavity bacterial microbiota and cancer. We gather literature on the current knowledge of the bacterial contribution to cancer development and the mechanisms behind it.",

      "abstract": "Regenerative dentistry is a rapidly evolving field in dentistry, which has been driven by advancements in biomedical engineering research and the rising treatment expectations and demands that exceed the scope of conventional approaches. Tissue engineering, the foundation of regenerative dentistry, mainly focuses on 3 key components: stem cells, bioactive molecules, and scaffolds. Dental tissue-derived stem cells are especially significant in this regard due to their remarkable properties. Regenerative techniques have provided novel approaches to many conventional treatment strategies in various disciplines of dentistry. For instance, regenerative endodontic procedures such as pulp revascularisation have provided an alternative approach to conventional root canal treatment. In addition, conventional surgical and nonsurgical periodontal treatment is being taken over by modified approaches of guided tissue regeneration with the aid of 3-dimensional bioprinting and computer-aided design, which has revolutionised oral and maxillofacial tissue engineering. This review presents a concise overview of the latest treatment strategies that have emerged into clinical practice, potential future technologies, and the role of dental tissue-derived stem cells in regenerative dentistry.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonia (AP) is a sub-type of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) still poorly recognized especially in the absence of an aspiration event. A further difficulty is the differentiation between AP and aspiration pneumonitis. From a clinical perspective, AP is becoming increasingly relevant as a potential cause of severe and life-threatening respiratory infection among frail and very old patients, particularly among those with CAP requiring inpatient care. Moreover, AP is frequently underdiagnosed and a clear-cut definition of this pathological entity is lacking. There are different factors that increase the risk for aspiration, but other common factors influencing oral colonization such as malnutrition, smoking, poor oral hygiene or dry mouth, are also important in the pathogenesis of AP and should be considered. While there is no doubt in the diagnosis of AP in cases of a recent witnessed aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric content, we here proposed a definition of AP that also includes silent unobserved aspirations. For this reason, the presence of one or more risk factors of oropharyngeal aspiration is required together with one or more risk factors for oral bacterial colonization. This proposed definition based on expert opinion not only unifies the diagnostic criteria of AP, but also provides the possibility to devise easily applicable strategies to prevent oral colonization.",

      "abstract": "The popularity of e-cigarettes has increased rapidly in the last decade, particularly among teens and young adults, being advertised as a less harmful alternative to conventional tobacco products. However, in vitro and in vivo studies have evidenced a variable quantity of potentially harmful components and some recognized carcinogens which may cause DNA damage in oral cells. Additionally, evidence suggests that e-cigarettes may play active roles in the pathogenesis of other malignancies, such as lung and bladder cancers. Therefore, this rapid review aimed to assess the available clinical evidence about using e-cigarettes as a risk factor for oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral cancer.",

      "abstract": "Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ) represents a serious health condition, impacting the lives of many patients worldwide. The condition challenges clinical care due to its complex etiology and limited therapeutic options. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiological and patient-related factors that promote disease development is essential. Recently, the oral microbiome has been implicated as a potential driver and modulating factor of BRONJ by several studies. Modern genomic sequencing methods have provided a wealth of data on the microbial composition of BRONJ lesions; however, the role of individual species in the process of disease development remains elusive. A comprehensive PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant studies on the microbiome of BRONJ patients using the terms \"microbiome\", \"osteonecrosis of the jaws\", and \"bisphosphonates\". Studies focusing on symptoms, epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors, and treatment options were included. The principal risk factors for BRONJ are tooth extraction, surgical procedures, and the administration of high doses of bisphosphonates. Importantly, the oral microbiome plays a significant role in the progression of the disease. Several studies have identified alterations of microbial composition in BRONJ lesions. However, there is no consensus regarding bacterial species that are associated with BRONJ across studies. The bacterial genera typically found include ",

It is therefore important to assess what awaits us in the coming years. Both with regard to supporting and treating (former) oncology patients. Forinstance, detecting secondary effects of cancer treatments such as oral mucositis and medication- and radiation-related jaw necrosis, as well as the early detection of oral cavity carcinomas and sun-related skin damage on the lips and face.

      "abstract": "Prominent lower front teeth (Class III malocclusion) may be due to jaw or tooth position or both. The upper jaw (maxilla) can be too far back or the lower jaw (mandible) too far forward; the upper front teeth (incisors) may be tipped back or the lower front teeth tipped forwards. Orthodontic treatment uses different types of braces (appliances) fitted inside or outside the mouth (or both) and fixed to the teeth. A facemask is the most commonly reported non-surgical intervention used to correct Class III malocclusion. The facemask rests on the forehead and chin, and is connected to the upper teeth via an expansion appliance (known as 'rapid maxillary expansion' (RME)). Using elastic bands placed by the wearer, a force is applied to the top teeth and jaw to pull them forwards and downward. Some orthodontic interventions involve a surgical component; these go through the gum into the bone (e.g. miniplates). In severe cases, or if orthodontic treatment is unsuccessful, people may need jaw (orthognathic) surgery as adults. This review updates one published in 2013.",

Here, we linked single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and secretome analysis to characterize human fetal tooth development over time. A spatiotemporal atlas of human tooth development at multiple levels was mapped, identifying previously uncharacterized epithelial subpopulations with distinct gene expression profiles and spatial localization. Dynamic changes in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions across developmental stages were characterized. Secretome analysis confirmed the extensive paracrine signaling from the epithelial to mesenchymal compartments and uncovered signaling factors produced by dental epithelium (DE) that regulate mesenchymal cell fate and differentiation. Integration of these datasets highlighted the crucial role of the DE in orchestrating tooth morphogenesis. Our multi-omics approach not only provides unprecedented insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ectoderm-derived tissue development but also serves as a valuable resource, which is publicly available online, for future studies on human tooth regeneration and related diseases.",

The idea of developing an enamel-like adhesion interface holds great promise in achieving enduring dentin adhesion. In this study, we constructed an enamel-like adhesion interface using a rapid remineralization strategy comprising an acidic primer and a rapid remineralization medium. Specifically, the acidic primer of 10-methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) nanocomplex (MDP@EGCG primer) was utilized to partially demineralize dentin within 30 s, and the MDP@EGCG nanocomplex showed a strong interaction with exposed collagen, enhancing collagen remineralization properties. Then, the rapid remineralization medium containing polyaspartate (Pasp) stabilized amorphous calcium and phosphorus nanoclusters (rapid Pasp-CaP) was applied to modified dentin collagen for 1 min, which caused rapid collagen remineralization within a clinically acceptable time frame. This strategy successfully generated an inorganic rough and porous adhesive interface resembling etched enamel, fundamentally addressed issues of collagen exposure, and achieved durable dentin adhesion ",

      "abstract": "The regulatory processes in developmental biology research are significantly influenced by long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). However, the dynamics of lncRNA expression during human tooth development remain poorly understood. In this research, we examined the lncRNAs present in the dental epithelium (DE) and dental mesenchyme (DM) at the late bud, cap, and early bell stages of human fetal tooth development through bulk RNA sequencing. Developmental regulators co-expressed with neighboring lncRNAs were significantly enriched in odontogenesis. Specific lncRNAs expressed in the DE and DM, such as PANCR, MIR205HG, DLX6-AS1, and DNM3OS, were identified through a combination of bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell analysis. Further subcluster analysis revealed lncRNAs specifically expressed in important regions of the tooth germ, such as the inner enamel epithelium and coronal dental papilla (CDP). Functionally, we demonstrated that CDP-specific DLX6-AS1 enhanced odontoblastic differentiation in human tooth germ mesenchymal cells and dental pulp stem cells. These findings suggest that lncRNAs could serve as valuable cell markers for tooth development and potential therapeutic targets for tooth regeneration.",

The primary aim of this revision is to analyze the association between oral healthcare and carcinogenic gastrointestinal processes, providing a possible future preventive strategy for dental care. Moreover, we intend to raise awareness about the importance of oral healthcare as a new paradigm and study variable in the global health care system.",

      "title": "Biogeographical Impacts of Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Microbial Reservoirs.",
      "abstract": "The human mouth, or oral cavity, is at the crossroads of our external and internal environments, and it is increasingly evident that local colonization of dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) tissues and cells by bacteria and viruses may also have systemic effects across myriad diseases and disorders. Better understanding of this phenomenon will require a holistic understanding of host-microbial interactions in both spatiotemporal and biogeographical contexts while also considering person-, organ-, tissue-, cell-, and molecular-level variation. After the acute phase interaction with microbes, the establishment of site-specific reservoirs constitutes an important relationship to understand within the human body; however, despite a preliminary understanding of how viral reservoirs originate and persist across the human body, the landscape of single-cell and spatial multiomic tools has challenged our current understanding of what cells and niches can support microbial reservoirs. The lack of complete understanding impacts research into these relevant topics and implementing precision care for microbial-induced or microbial-influenced diseases. Here, via the lens of acute and chronic microbial infections of the DOC tissues, the goal of this review is to highlight and link the emerging spatiotemporal biogeography of host-viral interactomics at 3 levels: (1) DOC cell types in distinct tissues, (2) DOC-associated microbes, and (3) niche-specific DOC pathologies. Further, we will focus on the impact of postacute infectious syndromes such as long COVID, neurodegenerative disorders, and other underappreciated postviral conditions. We will provide hypotheses about how DOC tissues may play roles systemically in these conditions. Throughout, we will underscore how COVID-19 has catalyzed a new understanding of these biological questions, discuss future directions to study these phenomena, and highlight the utility of noninvasive oral biofluids in screening, monitoring, and intervening to prevent and/or ameliorate human infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "An ageing population, an estimated 47 million people currently living with dementia, and predictions of a threefold increase in people living with a diagnosis by 2050 have led the WHO to declare dementia a public health priority. Emerging research also suggests that dementia is linked to poor oral health and that oral health declines alongside cognitive decline. Drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of field and capital, this paper presents an analysis of interview data from participants with dementia, carers and carer/diagnosed dyads participating in a qualitative study of the mouth and oral health. We argue that Bourdieu's conceptual toolkit provides a way of contextualising experiences of oral health within dementia and un-picking the multi-layered impact of structure, institutions, biology, resource mobilisation and self in the context of a progressive disease which ultimately challenges knowledge of the self and the ability to interact with the world around us.",

      "title": "Revolutionizing oral care: Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-Regulating biomaterials for combating infection and inflammation.",
      "abstract": "The human oral cavity is home to a delicate symbiosis between its indigenous microbiota and the host, the balance of which is easily perturbed by local or systemic factors, leading to a spectrum of oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, and pulp infections. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in the host's innate immune defenses. However, in chronic inflammatory oral conditions, dysregulated immune responses can result in excessive ROS production, which in turn exacerbates inflammation and causes tissue damage. Conversely, the potent antimicrobial properties of ROS have inspired the development of various anti-infective therapies. Therefore, the strategic modulation of ROS by innovative biomaterials is emerging as a promising therapeutic approach for oral infection and inflammation. This review begins by highlighting the state-of-the-art of ROS-regulating biomaterials, which are designed to generate, scavenge, or modulate ROS in a bidirectional manner. We then delve into the latest innovations in these biomaterials and their applications in treating a range of oral diseases, including dental caries, endodontic and periapical conditions, periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and oral candidiasis. The review concludes with an overview of the current challenges and future potential of these biomaterials in clinical settings. This review provides novel insights for the ongoing development of ROS-based therapeutic strategies for oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cancer therapy-induced oral mucositis is a frequent major oncological problem, secondary to cytotoxicity of chemo-radiation treatment. Oral mucositis commonly occurs 7-10 days after initiation of therapy; it is a dose-limiting side effect causing significant pain, eating difficulty, need for parenteral nutrition and a rise of infections. The pathobiology derives from complex interactions between the epithelial component, inflammation, and the oral microbiome. Our longitudinal study analysed the dynamics of the oral microbiome (bacteria and fungi) in nineteen patients undergoing chemo-radiation therapy for oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma as compared to healthy volunteers. The microbiome was characterized in multiple oral sample types using rRNA and ITS sequence amplicons and followed the treatment regimens. Microbial taxonomic diversity and relative abundance may be correlated with disease state, type of treatment and responses. Identification of microbial-host interactions could lead to further therapeutic interventions of mucositis to re-establish normal flora and promote patients' health. Data presented here could enhance, complement and diversify other studies that link microbiomes to oral disease, prophylactics, treatments, and outcome.",

Electronic search was conducted on November 2021 using seven databases to identify case reports/series describing lesions in oral mucosa in COVID-19 confirmed cases. A total of 5,179 studies were found, being 39 eligible from 19 countries, totalling 116 cases. It was observed only COVID-19 non-vaccinated cases and no sex or age predilection. The oral lesions presentation was mostly single location (69.8%), commonly in the tongue, lips, and palate, being ulcer the main clinical presentation. According to severity index for COVID-19, the reports were more frequent in patients with mild and moderate symptoms, being 75.8% in acute phase. The oral lesion appearance in post-acute COVID-19 were described after 14 to two months after patient recovery. Histologically, keratinocytes with perinuclear vacuolization, thrombosis and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate were also described with the presence of the virus in keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and minor salivary glands. In conclusion, health care professionals should consider COVID-19 association when patient present ulcerated oral lesions and mild to moderate symptoms for COVID-19 or had acute-COVID-19.",

In this study, we characterized simultaneously the oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes in a large cohort of systemically healthy Chinese adults by sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal internal transcribed spacer. We showed that different factors shaped the oral bacterial and fungal microbiomes in healthy adults. Sex and age were associated with the alpha diversity of the healthy oral bacterial microbiome but not that of the fungal microbiome. Age was also a major factor affecting the beta diversity of the oral bacterial microbiome; however, it only exerted a small effect on the oral fungal microbiome when compared with other variables. After controlling for age and sex, the bacterial microbiota structure was most affected by marital status, recent oral conditions and oral hygiene-related factors, whereas the fungal microbiota structure was most affected by education level, fruits and vegetables, and bleeding gums. Bacterial-fungal interactions were limited in the healthy oral microbiota, with the strongest association existing between Pseudomonas sp. and ",

Dietary monitoring is also crucial to reduce the likelihood of chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes by analyzing food types, amounts and diet patterns. Therefore, the oral cavity and dietary monitoring are vital for accurate personalized healthcare management that can improve healthcare. To perform continuous oral cavity and dietary monitoring in real-time, a wearable sensing system capable of continuous analysis is necessary. In this review, we classify chemical and physical biosensing methods and summarize recent progress in wearable sensor development for oral cavity and dietary monitoring for personalized healthcare and digital medicine. We also discuss future perspectives and the potential of wearable sensors to provide robust data for food-intake monitoring and the saliva analysis of super-aged/aging societies, non-face-to-face social life, and global pandemic disease issues. We believe that this review will result in a paradigm shift toward personalized healthcare and digital medicine using wearable sensors through the analysis of massively parallel healthcare data.",

      "abstract": "Severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has led to more than 3.25 million recorded deaths worldwide as of May 2021. COVID-19 is known to be clinically heterogeneous, and whether the reported oral signs and symptoms in COVID-19 are related to the direct infection of oral tissues has remained unknown. Here, we review and summarize the evidence for the primary infection of the glands, oral mucosae, and saliva by SARS-CoV-2. Not only were the entry factors for SARS-CoV-2 found in all oral tissues, but these were also sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Furthermore, saliva from asymptomatic individuals contained free virus and SARS-CoV-2-infected oral epithelial cells, both of which were found to transmit the virus. Collectively, these studies support an active role of the oral cavity in the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition to maintaining the appropriate use of personal protective equipment and regimens to limit microbial spread via aerosol or droplet generation, the dental community will also be involved in co-managing COVID-19 \"long haulers\"-now termed Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome. Consequently, we propose that, as SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and as new clinical challenges related to COVID-19 are documented, oral symptoms should be included in diagnostic and prognostic classifications as well as plans for multidisciplinary care.",

We describe our experience with three-dimensional (3D) TOETVA. We recruited 98 patients who were willing to undergo 3D TOETVA. Inclusion criteria were: (a) patients with a neck ultrasound (US) with an estimated thyroid diameter of 10cm or less; (b) estimated US gland volume ≤45ml; (c) nodule size ≤50mm; (d) benign tumor, such as thyroid cyst, goiter with one nodule, or goiter with multiple nodules; (e) follicular neoplasia; and (f) papillary microcarcinoma without evidence of metastases. The procedure is performed using a three-port technique at the oral vestibule, a 10mm port for the 30° endoscope, and two additional 5mm ports for dissecting and coagulation instruments. The CO2 insufflation pressure is set at 6mmHg. An anterior cervical subplatysmal space is created from the oral vestibule to the sternal notch and laterally to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Thyroidectomy is performed entirely 3D endoscopically with conventional endoscopic instruments and intraoperative neuromonitoring. There were 34% total thyroidectomies and 66% hemithyroidectomies. Ninety-eight 3D TOETVA procedures were successfully performed without any conversions. The mean operative time was 87.6 minutes (59-118 minutes) for lobectomy and 107.6 minutes (99-135 minutes) for bilateral surgery. We observed one case of transient postoperative hypocalcemia. Paralysis of the recurrent laryngeal nerve did not occur. The cosmetic outcome was excellent in all patients. This is the first case series of 3D TOETVA.",

      "abstract": "The history of dentistry and medicine has a deep and ancient bond with the history of anatomy. From the ancient times to the present, the study of the human body represents the basis for research and clinical therapy. The historical contribution of anatomists to the development of dental medicine also helped in its characterization as an integrated but special and independent branch of medicine. From Galen's studies on animals to the discoveries of dental hard tissues characteristics using a microscope, this paper provides a brief literature review of how anatomy broadly contributed to the development of the dental sciences and how it still allows us to direct critical and fundamental anatomical-clinical paths for modern patient care. The history of the anatomy of teeth, description of skull bones, maxillary sinus characterization, the salivary glands, the tongue and labial musculature, and the microscopic anatomy of dental hard tissues will be examined. Historical research on the understanding of and progress in the oral field is of utmost importance in current clinical practice, thus inducing a future orientation in research. Most of the research especially that connected to the more distant historical periods has seen as main characters great personalities of morphological sciences, which contributes constituted fundamental basis for dental clinical aspects. Through a punctual and continuous historical assay, the ancient insights are reconnected to more recent knowledge and distinct research, thus permitting a detailed reconstruction of the historical-anatomical course in the progress of knowledge regarding the oral cavity and related anatomical structures.",

The diagnosis is usually quite clear in endemic regions such as Brazil, but it can be challenging to clinicians in nonendemic counties when faced with a patient who has acquired the infection elsewhere. We report two clinical cases of human intraoral myiasis and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Two men, both of whom were in situations of vulnerability presented with myiasis: the first patient had larvae infesting the alveolar ridge region after tooth extraction, while the second was diagnosed with inflammatory fibrous hyperplasia associated with larvae along the edges of the lesion. Both were treated with ivermectin and antibiotics, and given guidance on preventative care. Such infestations are often a clear sign of neglect, and clinicians need to pay attention to the general health of patients affected by oral myiasis.",

      "abstract": "Oral microbial dysbiosis contributes to the development of schizophrenia (SZ). While numerous studies have investigated alterations in the oral bacterial microbiota among SZ patients, investigations into the fungal microbiota, another integral component of the oral microbiota, are scarce. In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 118 Chinese patients with SZ and 97 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) to evaluate the oral fungal microbiota from tongue coating samples using internal transcribed spacer 1 amplicon sequencing and assess host immunity via multiplex immunoassays. Our findings revealed that SZ patients exhibited reduced fungal richness and significant differences in β-diversity compared to HCs. Within the oral fungal communities, we identified two distinct fungal clusters (mycotypes): Candida and Malassezia, with SZ patients showing increased Malassezia and decreased Candida levels. These key functional oral fungi may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers for SZ. Furthermore, SZ patients displayed signs of immunological dysfunction, characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, and chemokines including MIP-1α and MCP-1. Importantly, Malassezia mycotype correlated positively with peripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines, while Candida mycotype exhibited a negative correlation with these cytokines. In conclusion, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of altered oral fungal communities and systemic immune dysfunction in Chinese SZ patients compared to HCs, providing novel insights into the potential role of oral fungi as biomarkers and the broader implications for understanding SZ pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "The oral microbiota is an essential microbial community within the human body, playing a vital role in maintaining health. In older adults, age-related changes in the oral microbiota are linked to both systemic and oral health impairments. The use of various medications for systemic diseases in the elderly can also contribute to the development of oral diseases. Oral microbiota dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the composition of oral microbial communities. This imbalance, along with disruptions in the host immune response and prolonged inflammation, is closely associated with the onset and progression of several diseases. It contributes to oral conditions such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. It is also linked to systemic diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aspiration pneumonia. This review aims to explore how oral microbiota influences specific health outcomes in older individuals, focusing on Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and aspiration pneumonia. The oral microbiota holds promise as a diagnostic tool, therapeutic target, and prognostic biomarker for managing cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases, infectious diseases and autoimmune diseases. Emphasizing proper oral health care and instilling an understanding of how drugs prescribed for systemic disease impact the oral microbiome, is anticipated to emerge as a key strategy for promoting the general health of older adults.",

Given its adverse health outcomes and high healthcare and societal costs, other treatment options beyond pharmacotherapy have been explored. Case-control studies have shown that dietary patterns may influence the risk of ADHD, and specific dietary interventions have been proposed as coadjuvant treatments in this disorder. These include nutritional supplements, gut microbiome-targeted interventions with biotics, and elimination diets. The purpose of this review is to examine which dietary patterns are most associated with ADHD and to summarize the existing evidence for the clinical use of dietary interventions. The literature showed that non-healthy dietary patterns were positively associated with ADHD, whereas healthy patterns were negatively associated. As for nutritional supplements, only vitamin D and vitamin D + magnesium appeared to improve ADHD symptoms when baseline levels of vitamin D were insufficient/deficient. Regarding biotics, evidence was only found for ",

      "abstract": "All nations which have undergone a nutrition transition have experienced increased frequency and falling latency of chronic degenerative diseases, which are largely driven by chronic inflammatory stress. Dietary supplementation is a valid strategy to reduce the risk and severity of such disorders. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endocannabinoid-like lipid mediator with extensively documented anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects. It is well tolerated and devoid of side effects in animals and humans. PEA's actions on multiple molecular targets while modulating multiple inflammatory mediators provide therapeutic benefits in many applications, including immunity, brain health, allergy, pain modulation, joint health, sleep and recovery. PEA's poor oral bioavailability, a major obstacle in early research, has been overcome by advanced delivery systems now licensed as food supplements. This review summarizes the functionality of PEA, supporting its use as an important dietary supplement for lifestyle management.",

Micronutrients play critical roles in embryogenesis, fetal growth, and maternal health, as energy, protein, vitamin, and mineral needs can increase during pregnancy. Increased needs can be met by increasing the intake of dietary micronutrients. Severe micronutrient deficiency or excess during pregnancy can have negative effects on fetal growth (intrauterine growth retardation, low birth weight, or congenital malformations) and pregnancy development (pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes). We investigate whether it is necessary to continue micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy to improve women's health in this stage and whether this supplementation could prevent and control pathologies associated with pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Accumulating research evidence suggests that nutrition might be implicated in the risk of development and in the management of autoimmune disease, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), characterized by immune-inflammatory response. Nutrition can have direct roles through the provision of pro- or anti-inflammatory foods, and indirect roles through management of co-morbidity management. The review updates on the evidence relating RA risk and management with focus on specific foods such as fish and diets/dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, fasting and elimination diets and oral nutritional supplements including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Evidence on herbs and spices, beverages, Vitamin D, and probiotics is also reviewed. Diet has been shown to improve disease activity through reducing inflammation and oxidation and through its beneficial effects on the gut microbiota. Based on the existing evidence, it is recommended that as an adjunct to medical treatment, nutrition therapy for RA should be based on an anti-inflammatory Mediterranean diet (MD) supplemented with at least twice a week consumption of oily fish and/or omega-3 PUFA supplements at 2 g/day. The need for rheumatologists to work more closely with registered dietitians in the management of patients particularly in supporting a well-balanced diet according to individual needs, is highlighted.",

Despite its safety and potential for use against various diseases, curcumin's utility is restricted due to its low oral bioavailability. Co-administration of curcumin along with piperine could potentially improve the bioavailability of curcumin. The present review aimed to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of curcumin-piperine co-supplementation in human health. The findings of this comprehensive review show the beneficial effects of curcumin-piperine in improving glycemic indices, lipid profile and antioxidant status in diabetes, improving the inflammatory status caused by obesity and metabolic syndrome, reducing oxidative stress and depression in chronic stress and neurological disorders, also improving chronic respiratory diseases, asthma and COVID-19. Further high-quality clinical trial studies are needed to firmly establish the clinical efficacy of the curcumin-piperine supplement.",

      "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are oxidized in the muscle and result in stimulating anabolic signals-which in return may optimize performance, body composition and recovery. Meanwhile, among athletes, the evidence about BCAA supplementation is not clear. The aim of this study was to review the effects of BCAAs in athletic populations. The research was conducted in three databases: Web of Science (all databases), PubMed and Scopus. The inclusion criteria involved participants classified both as athletes and people who train regularly, and who were orally supplemented with BCAAs. The risk of bias was individually assessed for each study using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2.0). From the 2298 records found, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Although BCAAs tended to activate anabolic signals, the benefits on performance and body composition were negligible. On the other hand, studies that included resistance participants showed that BCAAs attenuated muscle soreness after exercise, while in endurance sports the findings were inconsistent. The protocols of BCAA supplements differed considerably between studies. Moreover, most of the studies did not report the total protein intake across the day and, consequently, the benefits of BCAAs should be interpreted with caution.",

      "title": "The IRONy in Athletic Performance.",
      "abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient for athletes, intricately linked to their performance, by regulating cellular respiration and metabolism. Impaired iron levels in the body can significantly hinder athletic performance. The increased demand for iron due to exercise, coupled with potential dietary iron insufficiencies, particularly among endurance athletes, amplifies the risk of iron deficiency. Moreover, prolonged exercise can impact iron absorption, utilization, storage, and overall iron concentrations in an athlete. On the contrary, iron overload may initially lead to enhanced performance; however, chronic excess iron intake or underlying genetic conditions can lead to detrimental health consequences and may negatively impact athletic performance. Excess iron induces oxidative damage, not only compromising muscle function and recovery, but also affecting various tissues and organs in the body. This narrative review delineates the complex relationship between exercise and iron metabolism, and its profound effects on athletic performance. The article also provides guidance on managing iron intake through dietary adjustments, oral iron supplementation for performance enhancement in cases of deficiency, and strategies for addressing iron overload in athletes. Current research is focused on augmenting iron absorption by standardizing the route of administration while minimizing side effects. Additionally, there is ongoing work to identify inhibitors and activators that affect iron absorption, aiming to optimize the body's iron levels from dietary sources, supplements, and chelators. In summary, by refining the athletic diet, considering the timing and dosage of iron supplements for deficiency, and implementing chelation therapies for iron overload, we can effectively enhance athletic performance and overall well-being.",

      "title": "Oral iron supplementation in iron-deficient women: How much and how often?",
      "abstract": "Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) are major public health problems worldwide, especially in young women. Oral iron supplementation can be an effective strategy to treat and prevent IDA, but guidelines vary. Some experts recommend doses of 150-200 mg elemental iron per day, with the dose split through the day. However, recent studies suggest this may not be an optimal regimen. The fraction of iron absorbed from high doses of oral iron is low, and unabsorbed iron can cause gut irritation, inflammation and dysbiosis, and these reduce compliance. In recent studies using serum hepcidin profiles and stable iron isotopes to quantify iron absorption in young women, we have shown that: (a) oral iron doses ≥60 mg in iron-deficient women, and doses ≥100 mg in women with IDA, stimulate an acute increase in hepcidin that persists 24 h after the dose, but subsides by 48 h; (b) therefore, to maximize fractional iron absorption, oral doses ≥60 mg should be given on alternate days; (c) the circadian increase in plasma hepcidin is augmented by a morning iron dose; therefore, iron doses should not be given in the afternoon or evening after a morning dose. If rate of Hb response is important, a pooled analysis of our data done for this review indicates that total iron absorption is also higher if twice the target daily iron dose is given on alternate days. In summary, these studies suggest changing from daily to alternate-day schedules and from divided to morning single doses increases iron absorption and may reduce side effects. Thus, providing morning doses of 60-120 mg iron as a ferrous salt given with ascorbic acid on alternate days may be an optimal oral dosing regimen for women with iron-deficiency and mild IDA.",

      "abstract": "Low muscle mass is prevalent among patients with cancer and a predictor of adverse clinical outcomes. To counteract muscle loss, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation has been proposed as a potential therapy for older adults and various diseases states. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects and safety of HMB supplementation in relation to muscle mass and function and other clinical outcomes in patients with cancer. A systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, ProQuest, and grey literature for reports published from inception to December 2021 was conducted. Included studies provided supplements containing any dose of HMB to adult patients with active cancer. A synthesis without meta-analysis was conducted using a vote-counting approach based solely on the direction of the effect (i.e. regardless of statistical significance). Risk of bias was assessed for each outcome domain, and evidence from higher-quality studies (i.e. those with either low or moderate risk of bias) was examined. Safety was evaluated using both lower-quality and higher-quality studies. Fifteen studies were included, in which six were randomized controlled trials in patients with various cancer types and treatments. Studies prescribed HMB combined with amino acids (73.3%), HMB in oral nutritional supplements (20.0%), or both supplement types (6.7%); Ca-HMB doses of 3.0 g/day were provided in 80.0% of the studies. Four studies had high risk of bias across all outcome domains. Considering the higher-quality studies, evidence of a beneficial effect of HMB supplementation was found in four of four studies for muscle mass, two of two for muscle function, three of three for hospitalization, and five of seven for survival. In contrast, no beneficial effects of HMB on quality of life or body weight was found in two of four and three of five studies, respectively. A limited number of higher-quality studies evaluating the impact of HMB on cancer therapy-related toxicity, inflammation, and tumour response were observed. No serious adverse effects directly related to the nutrition intervention were reported. Although limited, current evidence suggests that HMB supplementation has a beneficial effect on muscle mass and function in patients with cancer. Well-designed trials are needed to further explore the clinical benefit of HMB supplementation in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "Spirulina is a kind of blue-green algae (BGA) that is multicellular, filamentous, and prokaryotic. It is also known as a cyanobacterium. It is classified within the phylum known as blue-green algae. Despite the fact that it includes a high concentration of nutrients, such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids-in particular, the necessary omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids-the percentage of total fat and cholesterol that can be found in these algae is substantially lower when compared to other food sources. This is the case even if the percentage of total fat that can be found in these algae is also significantly lower. In addition to this, spirulina has a high concentration of bioactive compounds, such as phenols, phycocyanin pigment, and polysaccharides, which all take part in a number of biological activities, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. As a result of this, spirulina has found its way into the formulation of a great number of medicinal foods, functional foods, and nutritional supplements. Therefore, this article makes an effort to shed light on spirulina, its nutritional value as a result of its chemical composition, and its applications to some food product formulations, such as dairy products, snacks, cookies, and pasta, that are necessary at an industrial level in the food industry all over the world. In addition, this article supports the idea of incorporating it into the food sector, both from a nutritional and health perspective, as it offers numerous advantages.",

DOACs were initially considered drugs with no significant food interactions; however, clinical observations from daily practice have proved otherwise as interactions with food ingredients have been reported. Food, dietary supplements or herbs may contain substances that, when administered concomitantly with DOACs, can potentially affect the plasma concentration of the drugs.

      "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on an analysis of the literature regarding the effects of β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate (HMB). The following 12 points have been approved by the Research Committee of the Society: 1. HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that is naturally produced in both humans and other animals. Two forms of HMB have been studied: Calcium HMB (HMB-Ca) and a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA). HMB-FA appears to lead to increased appearance of HMB in the bloodstream when compared to HMB-Ca, though recent results are mixed. 2. The available safety/toxicity data suggest that chronic HMB-Ca and HMB-FA consumption are safe for oral HMB supplementation in humans up to at least one year. 3. There are no negative effects of HMB-Ca and HMB-FA on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in humans. There may be improvements in glucose metabolism in younger adults. 4. The primary mode of action of HMB appears to be through its dual mechanism to enhance muscle protein synthesis and suppress muscle protein breakdown. HMB's activation of mTORC1 is independent of the leucine-sensing pathway (Sestrin2-GATOR2 complex). 5. HMB may help reduce muscle damage and promote muscle recovery, which can promote muscle growth/repair. HMB may also have anti-inflammatory effects, which could contribute to reducing muscle damage and soreness. 6. HMB consumption in close proximity to an exercise bout may be beneficial to increase muscle protein synthesis and attenuate the inflammatory response. HMB can provide a beneficial physiological effect when consumed both acutely and chronically in humans. 7. Daily HMB supplementation (38 mg/kg body weight) in combination with exercise training may improve body composition through increasing lean mass and/or decreasing fat mass with benefits in participants across age, sex, and training status. The most pronounced of these improvements in body composition with HMB have been observed in studies with robust resistance training programs and dietary control. 8. HMB may improve strength and power in untrained individuals, but its performance benefits in trained athletes are mixed and increase with an increase in study duration (>6 weeks). HMB's beneficial effects on athletic performance are thought to be driven by improved recovery. 9. HMB supplementation appears to potentially have a positive impact on aerobic performance, especially in trained athletes. The mechanisms of the effects are unknown. 10. HMB supplementation may be important in a non-exercising sedentary and aging population to improve muscle strength, functionality, and muscle quality. The effects of HMB supplementation with exercise are varied, but the combination may have a beneficial effect on the treatment of age-associated sarcopenia under select conditions. 11. HMB may be effective in countering muscle disuse atrophy during periods of inactivity due to illness or injury. The modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism by HMB may be a potential mechanism for preventing disuse atrophy and aiding rehabilitation beyond HMB's effects on rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. 12. The efficacy of HMB in combination with certain nutrients may be enhanced under select conditions.",

      "title": "International society of sports nutrition position stand: nutrition and weight cut strategies for mixed martial arts and other combat sports.",
      "abstract": "Following an extensive literature review, the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) has developed an official position on nutritional and weight cut strategies for combat sports. The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in). 11. Post-weigh-in, rapid weight gain strategies are utilized to recover lost body fluid/mass before competition with the intent of gaining a competitive advantage. 12. Oral rehydration solutions (1 to 1.5 liters/h) combined with a sodium range of 50-90 mmol/dL should take precedence immediately post-weigh-in. 13. Fast-acting carbohydrates at a tolerable rate of ≤ 60 g/h should follow oral rehydration solutions. Post weigh-in intake of fiber should be limited to avoid gastrointestinal distress. 14. Post-weigh-in carbohydrate intake at 8-12 g/kg may be appropriate for combat athletes that undertook significant glycogen depletion strategies during fight week. About 4-7 g/kg may be suitable for modest carbohydrate restriction. 15. Post weigh-in, rehydration/refueling protocols should aim to regain ≥10% of body mass to mitigate declines in performance and the negative effects of rapid weight loss. 16. The long-term effects of frequent weight cuts on health and performance are unknown, necessitating further research.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disorder. It disrupts sleep and well-being and is often associated with other conditions. This review examines the potential of dietary supplements to manage RLS symptoms and reduce reliance on medications. A total of 10 randomized clinical trials involving 482 participants were analyzed, focusing on the impact of various supplements on symptom severity, sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness. Findings suggest some supplements may have positive results. Magnesium oxide and vitamin B6 significantly improved sleep quality and RLS symptoms, with magnesium showing greater effectiveness. Vitamin D supplementation did not show significant benefits. Oral iron has promising results, indicating potential efficacy but issues related to compliance and absorption. Both vitamins C and E positively affect RLS symptoms, likely due to their antioxidant properties. Valerian improved RLS and sleep but did not show a statistically significant improvement. Despite these encouraging results, a high risk of bias was noted in half of the studies, emphasizing the need for more rigorous research. Overall, this review suggests that dietary supplements may be a promising approach to managing RLS. However, further investigation is required to confirm the efficacy and safety.",

      "abstract": "The impact of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) on patients with complications (disease related morbidity) requires further exploration. This systematic review included 44 randomised controlled trials (RCT) (29 RCT surgical, 15 RCT medical patients) examining the effect of ONS in community settings on the incidence of complications (n = 716, mean age 67 years, range 35-87). ONS (mean intake 588 kcal/day, range 125-1750; protein 22 g/day, range 0-54; mean energy from protein 22 %, range 0-54) were prescribed for a mean 74 days, range 5-365. Most RCT (77 %) reported fewer complications in the ONS group versus control. Meta-analysis (39 RCT) showed ONS consumption reduced complications including infections, pressure ulcers, wound and fracture healing (OR 0.68, 95 % CI 0.59,0.79; p<0.001). Results showed reductions when ONS were used in hospital and community settings (OR 0.72, 95 % CI 0.59,0.87; p = 0.001) or just in the community (OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.52, 0.80; p<0.001). Reductions in complications were only seen with high ONS adherence ≥ 80 % (OR 0.63, 95 % CI 0.48,0.83; p = 0.001) and ready-to-drink ONS (OR 0.69, 95 % CI 0.60,0.81; p<0.001). This systematic review and meta-analysis show community-based use of ONS in addition to the diet substantially reduces the incidence of complications. The diversity of ONS, patient populations and complication outcomes within the trials included in this review mean further research is warranted.",

Exacerbating this problem, some children are described by their parent as a picky eater with behaviors such as eating limited food and unwillingness to try new foods. Timely intervention can help prevent nutritional decline and promote growth recovery; oral nutritional supplements (ONS) and dietary counseling (DC) are commonly used. The present study aimed to determine the effects of ONS along with DC on growth in comparison with the effects of DC only. Enrolled children (N = 321) were >24 to ≤48 months old, at malnutrition risk (weight-for-height percentile 3rd to 15th), and described as a picky eater by their parent. Enrollees were randomized to one of the three groups (N = 107 per group): ONS1 + DC; ONS2 + DC; and DC only. From day 1 to day 90, study findings showed significant increases in weight-for-height percentile for ONS1 + DC and for ONS2 + DC interventions, as compared to DC only (",

      "abstract": "Oral health is essential for both overall health and quality of life. The mouth is a window into the body's health, and nutrition can strongly impact the state of general and oral health. A healthy diet involves the synergistic effect of various nutraceutical agents, potentially capable of conferring protective actions against some inflammatory and chronic-degenerative disorders. Nutraceuticals, mostly present in plant-derived products, present multiple potential clinical, preventive, and therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, preclinical and epidemiological studies suggested a protective role for these compounds, but their real preventive and therapeutic effects in humans still await confirmation. Available evidence suggests that plant extracts are more effective than individual constituents because they contain different phytochemicals with multiple pharmacological targets and additive/synergistic effects, maximizing the benefits for oral health. Moreover, nutritional recommendations for oral health should be personalized and aligned with valid suggestions for overall health. This review is aimed to: introduce the basic concepts of nutraceuticals, including their main food sources; examine the logic that supports their relationship with oral health, and summarize and critically discuss clinical trials testing the utility of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "According to the new classification, periodontitis is defined as a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease associated with dysbiotic biofilms and characterized by progressive destruction of the tooth-supporting apparatus. This definition, based on the current scientific evidence, clearly indicates and emphasizes, beside the microbial component dental biofilm, the importance of the inflammatory reaction in the progressive destruction of periodontal tissues. The idea to modulate this inflammatory reaction in order to decrease or even cease the progressive destruction was, therefore, a logical consequence. Attempts to achieve this goal involve various kinds of anti-inflammatory drugs or medications. However, there is also an increasing effort in using food supplements or so-called natural food ingredients to modulate patients' immune responses and maybe even improve the healing of periodontal tissues. The aim of this chapter of Periodontology 2000 is to review the evidence of various food supplements and ingredients regarding their possible effects on periodontal inflammation and wound healing. This review may help researchers and clinicians to evaluate the current evidence and to stimulate further research in this area.",

They are of particular interest because these uremic solutes are responsible for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. Evidence suggests that the relation between uremic toxins, the microbiome, and its host is altered in patients with chronic kidney disease, with the colon's motility, epithelial integrity, and absorptive properties also playing an important role. Studies found an alteration of the microbiota composition with differences in species proportion, diversity, and function. Since uremic toxins precursors are generated by the microbiota, multiple therapeutic options are currently being explored to address dysbiosis. While an oral adsorbent can decrease the transport of bacterial metabolites from the intestinal lumen to the blood, dietary measures, supplements (prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics), and antibiotics aim to target directly the gut microbiota composition. Innovative approaches, such as the modulation of bacterial enzymes, open new perspectives to decrease the plasma level of uremic toxins.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics are living bacterial cells that have significant therapeutic potential for treating human infectious diseases. There is a huge market for probiotics in the pharmaceutical sector. They have been frequently used to treat the gastrointestinal diseases and improve gut immunity. In this review, the strains currently in use for manufacturing oral probiotic formulations are discussed. The review further recommends the use of probiotics for the control of various oral health disorders, like dental caries, periodontitis, gingivitis, halitosis, burning mouth syndrome, and oral cancer. Finally, this review also explores the use of various commercial probiotic products in maintaining oral health, their market values, and government acts and regulations that are relevant to the production and marketing of probiotics. Probiotics have tremendous therapeutic potential and more in-depth research must be done on these beneficial bacteria to make them one of the leading drugs in treating oral disorders.",

      "abstract": "Achieving adequate micronutrient status, while avoiding deficiencies, represents a challenge for people globally. Consequently, many individuals resort to oral nutrient supplementation (ONS) in order to correct suboptimal dietary intakes. Advances in the fields of nutrigenetics and nutritional genomics have identified differences in response to micronutrient supplementation according to genetic makeup, adding dietary supplement use to the clinician's toolkit in the precision nutrition era. This review focuses on published evidence linking genetic variants to the responses associated with some of the most popular dietary supplements. With an increasing number of health professionals becoming involved in the prescription of ONS, identifying and matching individuals to the appropriate dietary supplement according to their genotype is important for achieving optimal health benefits and micronutrient equilibrium, while reducing the adverse events and financial costs often associated with excessive ONS.",

      "abstract": "Oral health is one of the necessary preludes to the overall quality of life. Several medical procedures and therapies are available to treat oral diseases in general and periodontal diseases in particular, yet caries, periodontitis, oral cancer, and oral infections remain a global concern. Natural molecules, with their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbic properties, are one of the main sources of oral health and dental health care, and should be supplemented to exploit their beneficial effects. A possible way to improve the intake of these molecules is adhering to a diet that is rich in fruits, vegetables, and probiotics, which has many beneficial properties and can improve overall health and wellbeing. The Mediterranean diet, in particular, provides several beneficial natural molecules, mainly because of the precious nutrients contained in its typical ingredients, mainly plant-based (olives, wine, citrus fruits, and many more). Its beneficial effects on several diseases and in increasing the overall wellbeing of the population are currently being studied by physicians. Among its nutrients, polyphenols (including, among other molecules, lignans, tannins, and flavonoids) seem to be of outmost importance: several studies showed their anticariogenic properties, as well as their effects in decreasing the incidence of non-communicable diseases. Therefore, plant-derived molecules - such as polyphenols - and probiotics - such as Lactobacillus reuteri - have shown a significant potential in treating and curing oral diseases, either alone or in combination, owing to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Probiotics are typically marketed as foods and dietary supplements, categories for products intended to maintain health in generally healthy populations and which, unlike drugs, cannot claim to treat or cure disease. This review addresses the existing evidence that probiotics are beneficial to healthy people. Our approach was to perform a descriptive review of efficacy evidence that probiotics can prevent urinary, vaginal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections, and improve risk factors associated with cardiovascular health or reduce antibiotic use. Other endpoints such as mental, dental, or immune health were not specifically addressed. We concluded that there is sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety for clinicians and consumers to consider using specific probiotics for some indications - such as the use of probiotics to support gut function during antibiotic use or to reduce the risk of respiratory tract infections - for certain people. However, we did not find a sufficiently high level of evidence to support unconditional, population-wide recommendations for other preventive endpoints we reviewed for healthy people. Although evidence for some indications is suggestive of the preventive benefits of probiotics, additional research is needed.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides an identification and detailed assessment of hormetic dose responses of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with particular emphasis on cell renewal (proliferation) and differentiation, underlying mechanistic foundations and potential therapeutic implications. Hormetic dose responses were commonly reported, being induced by a broad range of chemicals, including pharmaceuticals (e.g., atorvastatin, isoproterenol, lithium, nicotine, ouabain), dietary supplements (e.g., curcumin, multiple ginsenosides, resveratrol), endogenous agents (e.g., estrogen, hydrogen peroxide, melatonin), and physical stressor agents (e.g., hypoxia, ionizing radiation). ESC-hormetic dose responses are similar for other stem cell types (e.g., adipose-derived stem cells, apical papilla, bone marrow stem cells, dental pulp stem cells, endothelial stem cells, muscle stem cells, periodontal ligament stem cells, neural stem cells), indicating a high degree of generality for the hormetic-stem cells response. The widespread occurrence of hormetic dose responses shown by ESCs and other stem cells suggests that the hormetic dose response may represent a fundamental and highly conserved evolutionary strategy.",
