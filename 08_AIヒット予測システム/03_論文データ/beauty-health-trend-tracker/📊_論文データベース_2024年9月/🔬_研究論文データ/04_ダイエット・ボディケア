      "abstract": "Weight regain after successful weight loss resulting from lifestyle interventions is a major challenge in the management of overweight and obesity. Knowledge of the causal mechanisms for weight regain can help researchers and clinicians to find effective strategies to tackle weight regain and reduce obesity-associated metabolic and cardiovascular complications. This Review summarizes the current understanding of a number of potential physiological mechanisms underlying weight regain after weight loss, including: the role of adipose tissue immune cells; hormonal and neuronal factors affecting hunger, satiety and reward; resting energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis; and lipid metabolism (lipolysis and lipid oxidation). We describe and discuss obesity-associated changes in these mechanisms, their persistence during weight loss and weight regain and their association with weight regain. Interventions to prevent or limit weight regain based on these factors, such as diet, exercise, pharmacotherapy and biomedical strategies, and current knowledge on the effectiveness of these interventions are also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Martínez-Gómez, MG and Roberts, BM. Metabolic adaptations to weight loss: A brief review. J Strength Cond Res 36(10): 2970-2981, 2022-As the scientific literature has continuously shown, body mass loss attempts do not always follow a linear fashion nor always go as expected even when the intervention is calculated with precise tools. One of the main reasons why this tends to happen relies on our body's biological drive to regain the body mass we lose to survive. This phenomenon has been referred to as \"metabolic adaptation\" many times in the literature and plays a very relevant role in the management of obesity and human weight loss. This review will provide insights into some of the theoretical models for the etiology of metabolic adaptation as well as a quick look into the physiological and endocrine mechanisms that underlie it. Nutritional strategies and dietetic tools are thus necessary to confront these so-called adaptations to body mass loss. Among some of these strategies, we can highlight increasing protein needs, opting for high-fiber foods or programming-controlled diet refeeds, and diet breaks over a large body mass loss phase. Outside the nutritional aspects, it might be wise to increase the physical activity and thus the energy flux of an individual when possible to maintain diet-induced body mass loss in the long term. This review will examine these protocols and their viability in the context of adherence and sustainability for the individual toward successful body mass loss.",

These benefits include extended longevity, weight loss, and counteracting various disease conditions. Such procedures positively influence the benefits of human tissue-specific microbiomes and minimize the consequences of organellar apoptosis.

All forms of fasting reviewed here-alternate-day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating (TRE)-produced mild to moderate weight loss (1-8% from baseline) and consistent reductions in energy intake (10-30% from baseline). These regimens may benefit cardiometabolic health by decreasing blood pressure, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels are also lowered, but findings are variable. Other health benefits, such as improved appetite regulation and favorable changes in the diversity of the gut microbiome, have also been demonstrated, but evidence for these effects is limited. Intermittent fasting is generally safe and does not result in energy level disturbances or increased disordered eating behaviors. In summary, intermittent fasting is a safe diet therapy that can produce clinically significant weight loss (>5%) and improve several markers of metabolic health in individuals with obesity.",

      "title": "Cancer Cachexia: Its Mechanism and Clinical Significance.",
      "abstract": "The term \"cachexia\" is derived from the Greek words kakos (bad) and hexis (habit). Cachexia is a malnutrition associated with chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, and autoimmune diseases, and is characterized by decreased skeletal muscle mass. Cancer cachexia is quite common in patients with advanced cancer. Weight loss is also a characteristic symptom of cancer cachexia, along with decreased skeletal muscle mass. As nutritional supplementation alone cannot improve cachexia, cytokines and tumor-derived substances have been attracting attention as its relevant factors. Cancer cachexia can be also associated with reduced chemotherapeutic effects, increased side effects and treatment interruptions, and even poorer survival. In 2011, a consensus definition of cachexia has been proposed, and the number of relevant research reports has increased significantly. However, the pathogenesis of cachexia is not fully understood, and there are currently few regulatory-approved standard treatments for cachexia. The main reason for this is that multiple etiologies are involved in the development of cachexia. In this review, we will outline the current status of cachexia, the mechanisms of which have been elucidated in recent years, especially from the perspective of advanced cancer.",

      "title": "Incretin-Based Weight Loss Pharmacotherapy: Can Resistance Exercise Optimize Changes in Body Composition?",
      "abstract": "This narrative review highlights the degree to which new antiobesity medications based on gut-derived nutrient-stimulated hormones (incretins) cause loss of lean mass, and the importance of resistance exercise to preserve muscle. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) induce substantial weight loss in randomized trials, effects that may be enhanced in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists. Liraglutide and semaglutide (GLP-1RA), tirzepatide (GLP-1 and GIP receptor dual agonist), and retatrutide (GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptor triple agonist) are peptides with incretin agonist activity that induce ∼15-24% weight loss in adults with overweight and obesity, alongside beneficial impacts on blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin. However, these agents also cause rapid and significant loss of lean mass (∼10% or ∼6 kg), comparable to a decade or more of aging. Maintaining muscle mass and function as humans age is crucial to avoiding sarcopenia and frailty, which are strongly linked to morbidity and mortality. Studies indicate that supervised resistance exercise training interventions with a duration >10 weeks can elicit large increases in lean mass (∼3 kg) and strength (∼25%) in men and women. After a low-calorie diet, combining aerobic exercise with liraglutide improved weight loss maintenance compared with either alone. Retaining lean mass during incretin therapy could blunt body weight (and fat) regain on cessation of weight loss pharmacotherapy. We propose that tailored resistance exercise training be recommended as an adjunct to incretin therapy to optimize changes in body composition by preserving lean mass while achieving fat loss.",

      "abstract": "New appetite-regulating antiobesity treatments such as semaglutide and agents under investigation such as tirzepatide show promise in achieving weight loss of 15% or more. Energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and lean mass preservation are important determinants of weight loss and weight-loss maintenance beyond appetite regulation. This review discusses prior failures in clinical development of weight-loss drugs targeting energy expenditure and explores novel strategies for targeting energy expenditure: mitochondrial proton leak, uncoupling, dynamics, and biogenesis; futile calcium and substrate cycling; leptin for weight maintenance; increased sympathetic nervous system activity; and browning of white fat. Relevant targets for preserving lean mass are also reviewed: growth hormone, activin type II receptor inhibition, and urocortin 2 and 3. We endorse moderate modulation of energy expenditure and preservation of lean mass in combination with efficient appetite reduction as a means of obtaining a significant, safe, and long-lasting weight loss. Furthermore, we suggest that the regulatory guidelines should be revisited to focus more on the quality of weight loss and its maintenance rather than the absolute weight loss. Commitment to this research focus both from a scientific and from a regulatory point of view could signal the beginning of the next era in obesity therapies.",

      "abstract": "The history of antiobesity pharmacotherapies is marked by disappointments, often entangled with societal pressure promoting weight loss and the prevailing conviction that excess body weight signifies a lack of willpower. However, categories of emerging pharmacotherapies generate hope to reduce obesity rates. This systematic review of phase 2 and phase 3 trials in adults with overweight/obesity investigates the effect of novel weight loss pharmacotherapies, compared to placebo/control or US Food and Drug Administration-approved weight loss medication, through searching Medline, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov (2012-2024). We identified 53 phase 3 and phase 2 trials, with 36 emerging antiobesity drugs or combinations thereof and 4 withdrawn or terminated trials. Oral semaglutide 50 mg is the only medication that has completed a phase 3 trial. There are 14 ongoing phase 3 trials on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) (ecnoglutide, orforglipron, and TG103), GLP-1 RA/amylin agonist (CagriSema), GLP-1/glucagon RAs (mazdutide and survodutide), GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon RA (retatrutide), dapagliflozin, and the combination sibutramine/topiramate. Completed phase 2 trials on incretin-based therapies showed a mean percent weight loss of 7.4% to 24.2%. Almost half of the drugs undergoing phase 2 trials are incretin analogs. The obesity drug pipeline is expanding rapidly, with the most promising results reported with incretin analogs. Data on mortality and obesity-related complications, such as cardio-renal-metabolic events, are needed. Moreover, long-term follow-up data on the safety and efficacy of weight maintenance with novel obesity pharmacotherapies, along with studies focused on underrepresented populations, cost-effectiveness assessments, and drug availability, are needed to bridge the care gap for patients with obesity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Obesity is the epidemic of the 21st century. Except for the newer injectable medications, drugs with suboptimal efficacy have been available in the clinician's armamentarium for weight management. However, emerging alternatives of novel agents and combinations populate the current obesity therapeutic pipeline. This systematic review identifies the state and mechanism of action of emerging pharmacotherapies undergoing or having completed phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. The information provided herein furthers the understanding of obesity management, implying direct clinical implications and stimulating research initiatives.",

      "abstract": "Unintentional weight loss in people older than 65 years is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Nonmalignant diseases are more common causes of unintentional weight loss in this population than malignant causes. However, malignancy accounts for up to one-third of cases of unintentional weight loss. Medication use and polypharmacy can interfere with the sense of taste or induce nausea and should not be overlooked as causative factors. Social factors such as isolation and financial constraints may contribute to unintentional weight loss. A readily identifiable cause is not found for 6% to 28% of cases. Recommended tests include age-appropriate cancer screenings, complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, lactate dehydrogenase measurement, ferritin, protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis. Chest radiography and fecal occult blood testing should be performed. Further imaging and invasive testing may be considered based on initial evaluation. When the initial evaluation is unremarkable, a three- to six-month observation period is recommended with follow-up based on clinician and patient preferences. Treatment should focus on the underlying cause if known. Dietary modifications that consider patient preferences and chewing or swallowing disabilities should be considered. Appetite stimulants and high-calorie supplements are not recommended. Treatment should focus on feeding assistance, addressing contributing medications, providing appealing foods, and social support.",

The relationship between the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk is a controversial topic. This publication aimed to present evidence on the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. The ketogenic diet does not fulfill the criteria of a healthy diet. It presents the potential for rapid short-term reduction of body mass, triglycerides level, Hb1Ac, and blood pressure. Its efficacy for weight loss and the above-mentioned metabolic changes is not significant in long-term observations. In terms of cardiovascular mortality, the low-carb pattern is more beneficial than very low-carbohydrate (including the ketogenic diet). There is still scarce evidence comparing ketogenic to the Mediterranean diet. Other safety concerns in cardiovascular patients such as adverse events related to ketosis, fat-free mass loss, or potential pharmacological interactions should be also taken into consideration in future research.",

      "title": "The impact of weight loss on fat-free mass, muscle, bone and hematopoiesis health: Implications for emerging pharmacotherapies aiming at fat reduction and lean mass preservation.",
      "abstract": "Similar to bariatric surgery, incretin receptor agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, achieving up to 15-25 % weight loss in many patients, i.e., at a rate approaching that achieved with bariatric surgery. However, over 25 % of total weight lost from both surgery and pharmacotherapy typically comes from fat-free mass, including skeletal muscle mass, which is often overlooked and can impair metabolic health and increase the risk of subsequent sarcopenic obesity. Loss of muscle and bone as well as anemia can compromise physical function, metabolic rate, and overall health, especially in older adults. The myostatin-activin-follistatin-inhibin system, originally implicated in reproductive function and subsequently muscle regulation, appears to be crucial for muscle and bone maintenance during weight loss. Activins and myostatin promote muscle degradation, while follistatins inhibit their activity in states of negative energy balance, thereby preserving lean mass. Novel compounds in the pipeline, such as Bimagrumab, Trevogrumab, and Garetosmab-which inhibit activin and myostatin signaling-have demonstrated promise in preventing muscle loss while promoting fat loss. Either alone or combined with incretin receptor agonists, these medications may enhance fat loss while preserving or even increasing muscle and bone mass, offering a potential solution for improving body composition and metabolic health during significant weight loss. Since this dual therapeutic approach could help address the challenges of muscle and bone loss during weight loss, well-designed studies are needed to optimize these strategies and assess long-term benefits. For the time being, considerations like advanced age and prefrailty may affect the choice of suitable candidates in clinical practice for current and emerging anti-obesity medications due to the associated risk of sarcopenia.",

Decline in physical performance of patients with cachexia is associated with poor quality of life, and currently there are no effective pharmacological interventions that restore physical performance. Here we examine the effect of GDF15 neutralization in a mouse model of cancer-induced cachexia (TOV21G) that manifests weight loss and muscle function impairments. With comprehensive assessments, our results demonstrate that cachectic mice treated with the anti-GDF15 antibody mAB2 exhibit body weight gain with near-complete restoration of muscle mass and markedly improved muscle function and physical performance. Mechanistically, the improvements induced by GDF15 neutralization are primarily attributed to increased caloric intake, while altered gene expression in cachectic muscles is restored in caloric-intake-dependent and -independent manners. The findings indicate potential of GDF15 neutralization as an effective therapy to enhance physical performance of patients with cachexia.",

We highlight the main cytokine and immune cell-driven pathways that have been linked to weight loss and tissue wasting in the context of cancer-associated and infection-associated cachexia. Moreover, we discuss the potential immunometabolic consequences of cachexia on the basis of newly identified pathways and explore the multilayered area of immunometabolic crosstalk both upstream and downstream of tissue catabolism.

      "abstract": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases in the United States and worldwide. Obesity accounts for much of the risk for primary hypertension through several mechanisms, including neurohormonal activation, inflammation, and kidney dysfunction. As the prevalence of obesity continues to increase, hypertension and associated cardiorenal diseases will also increase unless more effective strategies to prevent and treat obesity are developed. Lifestyle modification, including diet, reduced sedentariness, and increased physical activity, is usually recommended for patients with obesity; however, the long-term success of these strategies for reducing adiposity, maintaining weight loss, and reducing blood pressure has been limited. Effective pharmacotherapeutic and procedural strategies, including metabolic surgeries, are additional options to treat obesity and prevent or attenuate obesity hypertension, target organ damage, and subsequent disease. Medications can be useful for short- and long-term obesity treatment; however, prescription of these drugs is limited. Metabolic surgery is effective for producing sustained weight loss and for treating hypertension and metabolic disorders in many patients with severe obesity. Unanswered questions remain related to the mechanisms of obesity-related diseases, long-term efficacy of different treatment and prevention strategies, and timing of these interventions to prevent obesity and hypertension-mediated target organ damage. Further investigation, including randomized controlled trials, is essential to addressing these questions, and emphasis should be placed on the prevention of obesity to reduce the burden of hypertensive cardiovascular and kidney diseases and subsequent mortality.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease that affects more than 650 million adults worldwide. Obesity not only is a significant health concern on its own, but predisposes to cardiometabolic comorbidities, including coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Lifestyle interventions effectively promote weight loss of 5% to 10%, and pharmacological and surgical interventions even more, with some novel approved drugs inducing up to an average of 25% weight loss. Yet, maintaining weight loss over the long-term remains extremely challenging, and subsequent weight gain is typical. The mechanisms underlying weight regain remain to be fully elucidated. The purpose of this Pennington Biomedical Scientific Symposium was to review and highlight the complex interplay between the physiological, behavioral, and environmental systems controlling energy intake and expenditure. Each of these contributions were further discussed in the context of weight-loss maintenance, and systems-level viewpoints were highlighted to interpret gaps in current approaches. The invited speakers built upon the science of obesity and weight loss to collectively propose future research directions that will aid in revealing the complicated mechanisms involved in the weight-reduced state.",

      "abstract": "Throughout their experience of illness and during the course of treatment, a substantial proportion of cancer patients are prone to develop nutritional and/or metabolic disturbances. Additionally, cancer patients often encounter long-term side effects from therapies, which may lead to impaired digestion, nutrient absorption or bowel motility. Therefore, the preservation and maintenance of an optimal and balanced nutritional status are pivotal to achieving a better prognosis, increasing the tolerance and adherence to cancer therapies and improving the overall quality of life. In this context, personalized nutritional programs are essential for addressing conditions predisposing to weight loss, feeding difficulties, digestion problems and intestinal irregularity, with the goal of promoting adequate nutrient absorption and minimizing the detrimental effects of treatment regimens. The focus of this research is to examine the most common clinical conditions and metabolic changes that cancer patients may experience, including stomatitis, xerostomia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, sub-occlusion, dysgeusia, dysosmia, anorexia, and cachexia. Furthermore, we present a pragmatic example of a multidisciplinary workflow that incorporates customized recipes tailored to individual clinical scenarios, all while maintaining the hedonic value of the meals.",

Here, I reinterpret the results of \"The Biggest Loser\" study in the context of a constrained model of human energy expenditure. Specifically, \"The Biggest Loser\" contestants engaged in large, sustained increases in physical activity that may have caused compensatory metabolic adaptations to substantially decrease resting metabolic rate and thereby minimize changes in total energy expenditure. This interpretation helps explain why the magnitude of persistent metabolic adaptation was largest in contestants with the greatest increases in sustained physical activity and why weight-loss interventions involving lower levels of physical activity have not measured similarly large metabolic adaptations. Additional longitudinal studies quantifying the interrelationships between various components of energy expenditure and energy intake are needed to better understand the dynamics of human body weight regulation.",

      "abstract": "The intragastric balloon is a temporary and minimally invasive therapy for weight loss, currently being the main choice for mild obesity. As a space-occupying device, it reduces stomach capacity, resulting in decreased hunger and food intake. There are different balloon models, filled with liquid or air. The most used is the non-adjustable liquid-filled balloon, due to its lower rate of complications. The mechanism of action is multifactorial, involving physiological and neurohormonal changes. The device functions as an artificial bezoar, filling the stomach and leading to early satiety. In the Brazilian Intragastric Balloon Consensus Statement, there was a mean excess weight loss of 18.4%, showing effective weight loss and good safety profile. It is a valid option for overweight and obese patients unresponsive to clinical therapy or who are either not candidates for surgery or who do not wish to undergo a definitive procedure. Besides weight loss, recent studies have shown a positive effect on metabolic parameters. New devices have been developed, such as procedureless and adjustable balloons, with promising results.",

      "title": "Obesity pharmacotherapy in older adults: a narrative review of evidence.",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity in older adults (people aged >60 years) is increasing in line with the demographic shift in global populations. Despite knowledge of obesity-related complications in younger adults (increased risk of type 2 diabetes, liver and cardiovascular disease and malignancy), these considerations may be outweighed, in older adults, by concerns regarding weight-loss induced reduction in skeletal muscle and bone mass, and the awareness of the 'obesity paradox'. Obesity in the elderly contributes to various obesity-related complications from cardiometabolic disease and cancer, to functional decline, worsening cognition, and quality of life, that will have already suffered an age-related decline. Lifestyle interventions remain the cornerstone of obesity management in older adults, with emphasis on resistance training for muscle strength and bone mineral density preservation. However, in older adults with obesity refractory to lifestyle strategies, pharmacotherapy, using anti-obesity medicines (AOMs), can be a useful adjunct. Recent evidence suggests that intentional weight loss in older adults with overweight and obesity is effective and safe, hence a diminishing reluctance to use AOMs in this more vulnerable population. Despite nine AOMs being currently approved for the treatment of obesity, limited clinical trial evidence in older adults predominantly focuses on incretin therapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide). AOMs enhance weight loss and reduce cardiometabolic events, while maintaining muscle mass. Future randomised controlled trials should specifically evaluate the effectiveness of novel AOMs for long-term weight management in older adults with obesity, carefully considering the impact on body composition and functional ability, as well as health economics.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic and complex disease associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and financial burden. It is expected that by 2030 one of two people in the United States will have obesity. The backbone for obesity management continues to be lifestyle interventions, consisting of calorie deficit diets and increased physical activity levels, however, these interventions are often insufficient to achieve sufficient and maintained weight loss. As a result, multiple patients require additional interventions such as antiobesity medications or bariatric interventions in order to achieve clinically significant weight loss and improvement or resolution of obesity-associated comorbidities. Despite the recent advances in the field of obesity pharmacotherapy that have resulted in never-before-seen weight loss outcomes, comorbidity improvement, and even reduction in cardiovascular mortality, there is still a significant interindividual variability in terms of response to antiobesity medications, with a subset of patients not achieving a clinically significant weight loss. Currently, the trial-and-error paradigm for the selection of antiobesity medications results in increased costs and risks for developing side effects, while also reduces engagement in weight management programs for patients with obesity. The implementation of a precision medicine framework to the selection of antiobesity medications might help reduce heterogeneity and optimize weight loss outcomes by identifying unique subsets of patients, or phenotypes, that have a better response to a specific intervention. The detailed study of energy balance regulation holds promise, as actionable behavioral and physiologic traits could help guide antiobesity medication selection based on previous mechanistic studies. Moreover, the rapid advances in genotyping, multi-omics, and big data analysis might hold the key to discover additional signatures or phenotypes that might respond better to a certain intervention and might permit the widespread adoption of a precision medicine approach for obesity management.",

      "abstract": "Overweight and obesity-chronic illnesses in which an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences-negatively impact female fertility. Adverse conception outcomes are multifactorial, ranging from poor oocyte quality and implantation issues to miscarriages and fetal health issues. However, with the advent of novel pharmacologic agents, significant weight loss can be achieved, improving the chances of healthy pregnancies, and their use should be considered during periconceptual counseling. There are currently 6 FDA-approved medications for weight loss: 2 GLP1-receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) liraglutide and semaglutide, 1 dual GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide agonist (GLP1-GIP) tirzepatide, Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion), Qsymia (phentermine/Topamax), and Xenical (orlistat). GLP1-RAs reduce food cravings, appetite, and \"food noise\" and improve insulin sensitivity and satiety, all of which lead to significant weight loss, ranging from 6 to 30% of starting total body weight or greater, depending on the specific agent used. Their efficacy and relative safety should make them first-line options for women seeking to lose weight in the year before trying to conceive. Contrave, the combination of naltrexone and bupropion, seems to work most significantly for weight loss by inhibiting the rewarding and reinforcing effects of food consumption. Clinical trials report ~ 6% loss of starting total body weight with use of Contrave, as well as improvement in metabolic health factors. It may also improve a woman's ability to conceive by mitigating the effects of PCOS and endometriosis and reducing the drive for alcohol and smoking. Qsymia, the combination of phentermine and topiramate, results in more weight loss than Contrave but cannot be used in the acute preconception period, as its topiramate component is a known teratogen. Orlistat is another FDA-approved medication for weight loss; however, it is currently used much less often than other anti-obesity drugs because of its relatively lower efficacy and significant side effects. Bariatric surgery, which can lead to significant weight loss (25-50%), was previously regarded as the most durable method for weight loss, before the advent of GLP1-RAs. Given the inherent risks of surgery, the development of vitamin (i.e. B12, folate, vitamin D) and mineral (i.e. iron, copper, zinc) deficiencies, that may impact the health of the mother and fetus, as well as the recommended delay of 1-2 years prior to attempting pregnancy, bariatric surgery should not be considered first-line therapy for obesity management in women of reproductive age, especially for women who are hoping to conceive quickly or are nearing advanced maternal age.",

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle's metabolic and mechanical functions make it critical for maintaining human health, physical function, and quality of life in adults. The impact of skeletal muscle mass and the metabolic quality of muscle tissue becomes even more critical with advancing age and in patients with chronic diseases. To this end, cachexia is the involuntary loss of body weight, including muscle and fat loss, accompanying an underlying disease or condition. Cancer-induced cachexia occurs across many types of cancer and contributes to increased patient mortality, morbidity, and treatment toxicities, negatively impacting survival. Furthermore, there are currently no approved pharmacological treatments and limited evidence-based therapeutic options to prevent muscle loss or promote muscle recovery in cancer patients. While the systemic effects of cancer and subsequent treatment continue to be examined as drivers of overall wasting, the impact of skeletal muscle mass and metabolic quality in the cancer patient remains a critical area of investigation. A vital knowledge gap exists in understanding how maintaining muscle function and metabolic properties improves cancer patients' survival. The chapter explores the current understanding of how cancer and subsequent treatment impact skeletal muscle mass, function, and metabolic quality. To this end, the current understanding of systemic mediators and metabolic crosstalk between tissues that promote cancer-induced wasting is explored. Additional factors related to sex, physical activity level, chemotherapy-specific effects, and cancer heterogeneity are discussed concerning their impact on cancer-induced muscle wasting.",

      "abstract": "The extent to which genetic variations contribute to interindividual differences in weight loss and metabolic outcomes after bariatric surgery is unknown. Identifying genetic variants that impact surgery outcomes may contribute to clinical decision making. This review evaluates current evidence addressing the association of genetic variants with weight loss and changes in metabolic parameters after bariatric surgery. A search was conducted using Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Fifty-two eligible studies were identified. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at ADIPOQ (rs226729, rs1501299, rs3774261, and rs17300539) showed a positive association with postoperative change in measures of glucose homeostasis and lipid profiles (n = 4), but not with weight loss after surgery (n = 6). SNPs at FTO (rs11075986, rs16952482, rs8050136, rs9939609, rs9930506, and rs16945088) (n = 10) and MC4R (rs11152213, rs476828, rs2229616, rs9947255, rs17773430, rs5282087, and rs17782313) (n = 9) were inconsistently associated with weight loss and metabolic improvement. Four studies examining the UCP2 SNP rs660339 reported associations with postsurgical weight loss. In summary, there is limited evidence supporting a role for specific genetic variants in surgical outcomes after bariatric surgery. Most studies have adopted a candidate gene approach, limiting the scope for discovery, suggesting that the absence of compelling evidence is not evidence of absence.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Behavioral interventions targeting sustained weight loss have largely failed for decades, with little chance of improvement using prevailing methods. Objective To address treatment limitations, a focused 25-year research program was reviewed through the lens of social cognitive theory, probative investigations, and original predictive models. Innovative, but evidence-based, treatment suggestions were sought. Results Task 1 of the research program addressed adherence to exercise, a well-established requirement for maintained weight loss. A culminating model addressing this treatment aspect suggested that interrelations among changes in self-regulatory skills usage, self-efficacy, and mood should guide exercise-support programming. Task 2 attached an eating-behavior change component and probed for malleable psychosocial variables predictive of success over the weight-loss phase (initial 6 months after treatment initiation). After thorough evaluation of selected theory- and research-driven psychosocial variables, changes in self-regulation, self-efficacy, and mood were again deemed to be the most salient predictors driving eating change. In Task 3, treatment foci related to changes in the 3 psychosocial variables were supported into the weight-loss maintenance phase (beyond 6 months), and the carry-over of changes in self-regulation and self-efficacy from exercise- to eating-related contexts was identified and leveraged. Task 4 suggested value in additionally addressing emotional eating as a distinct factor. Conclusion Suggestions informing principles and extensions of a treatment approach previously demonstrating atypically high degrees of success with maintaining weight loss in field- and community-based settings are provided. Those methods emanate from the reviewed research program, which shaped novel procedures to leverage exercise-induced psychosocial changes for their carry-over benefits for controlling eating.",

      "abstract": "Cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome is a multifactorial condition characterized by significant weight loss due to muscle loss. It is associated with functional impairment, changes in body composition and nutritional disorders. Ghrelin receptors are involved in the release of growth hormone (GH) in the pituitary gland and increase appetite via the hypothalamus. The secretion of GH from the pituitary gland stimulates the liver to secrete insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which promotes muscle protein synthesis. Anamorelin is a ghrelin receptor agonist used to treat cancer cachexia. It promotes GH secretion via ghrelin receptor activation and increases appetite, resulting in increased muscle mass and weight.

      "abstract": "Obesity is a disease of epidemic proportions in the United States and contributes to morbidity and mortality for a large part of the population. In addition, the financial costs of this disease to society are high. Lifestyle modifications are key to prevention and treatment but adherence and long-term success have been challenging. Bariatric surgery has been available and pharmacologic approaches, first developed in the 1950s, continue to be an option; however, existing formulations have not provided optimal clinical efficacy and have had many concerning adverse effects. Over the last decade, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, a novel group of medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, were found to produce significant weight loss. Several formulations, at higher doses, received FDA approval for the treatment of obesity or those overweight with weight-related co-morbidities. More hormone-based therapies were and are being developed, some with dual or triple-receptor agonist activity. Their use, however, is not without questions and concerns as to long-term safety and efficacy, problems with cost and reimbursement, and how their use may intersect with public health efforts to manage the obesity epidemic. This review will focus on the GLP-1 receptor agonists currently used for weight loss and discuss their pharmacology, pertinent research findings establishing their benefits and risks, issues with prescribing these medications, and a perspective from a public health point of view.",

      "abstract": "For more than a century, physicians have searched for ways to pharmacologically reduce excess body fat. The tide has finally turned with recent advances in biochemically engineered agonists for the receptor of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and their use in GLP-1-based polyagonists. These polyagonists reduce body weight through complementary pharmacology by incorporating the receptors for glucagon and/or the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). In their most advanced forms, gut-hormone polyagonists achieve an unprecedented weight reduction of up to ∼20%-30%, offering a pharmacological alternative to bariatric surgery. Along with favorable effects on glycemia, fatty liver, and kidney disease, they also offer beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and adipose tissue. These new interventions, therefore, hold great promise for the future of anti-obesity medications.",

Utilizing targeted cold exposure to adipose tissue, cryolipolysis devices induce cellular apoptosis in adipocytes while sparing surrounding tissues, resulting in the selective disruption of fat cells and subsequent removal of damaged cells by macrophages. A reduction of the fat layer produces a noninvasive cosmetic benefit that provides an accessible alternative to liposuction. Objective and subjective measurements have demonstrated significant reduction in fat volume and high patient satisfaction rates. Cryolipolysis has been proven to be safe with minimal adverse effects. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of cryolipolysis and its efficacy in different treatment areas.

      "abstract": "Similar to bariatric surgery, incretin receptor agonists have revolutionized the treatment of obesity, achieving up to 15-25 % weight loss in many patients, i.e., at a rate approaching that achieved with bariatric surgery. However, over 25 % of total weight lost from both surgery and pharmacotherapy typically comes from fat-free mass, including skeletal muscle mass, which is often overlooked and can impair metabolic health and increase the risk of subsequent sarcopenic obesity. Loss of muscle and bone as well as anemia can compromise physical function, metabolic rate, and overall health, especially in older adults. The myostatin-activin-follistatin-inhibin system, originally implicated in reproductive function and subsequently muscle regulation, appears to be crucial for muscle and bone maintenance during weight loss. Activins and myostatin promote muscle degradation, while follistatins inhibit their activity in states of negative energy balance, thereby preserving lean mass. Novel compounds in the pipeline, such as Bimagrumab, Trevogrumab, and Garetosmab-which inhibit activin and myostatin signaling-have demonstrated promise in preventing muscle loss while promoting fat loss. Either alone or combined with incretin receptor agonists, these medications may enhance fat loss while preserving or even increasing muscle and bone mass, offering a potential solution for improving body composition and metabolic health during significant weight loss. Since this dual therapeutic approach could help address the challenges of muscle and bone loss during weight loss, well-designed studies are needed to optimize these strategies and assess long-term benefits. For the time being, considerations like advanced age and prefrailty may affect the choice of suitable candidates in clinical practice for current and emerging anti-obesity medications due to the associated risk of sarcopenia.",

      "abstract": "The landmark discoveries of leptin and adiponectin firmly established adipose tissue as a sophisticated and highly active endocrine organ, opening a new era of investigating adipose-mediated tissue crosstalk. Both obesity-associated hyperleptinemia and hypoadiponectinemia are important biomarkers to predict cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting a crucial role for adiponectin and leptin in obesity-associated cardiovascular disorders. Normal physiological levels of adiponectin and leptin are indeed essential to maintain proper cardiovascular function. Insufficient adiponectin and leptin signaling results in cardiovascular dysfunction. However, a paradox of high levels of both leptin and adiponectin is emerging in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disorders. Here, we (1) summarize the recent progress in the field of adiponectin and leptin and its association with cardiovascular disorders, (2) further discuss the underlying mechanisms for this new paradox of leptin and adiponectin action, and (3) explore the possible application of partial leptin reduction, in addition to increasing the adiponectin/leptin ratio as a means to prevent or reverse cardiovascular disorders.",

Although etiology and pathogenesis of lipedema is unclear, possible role of hormonal and genetic factors have been proposed previously. Patients with lipedema suffer from pain, easy bruising, tenderness, and disfigurement. Pain is the leading symptom in lipedema. Since the pain is associated with depression and impaired quality of life, reduction of pain is the major therapeutic approach. Pain in lipedema is attributed to allodynia, exaggerated sympathetic signaling, and estrogens. Although the mechanism of pain in lipedema is uncertain, effective treatment of lipedema should provide a satisfactory pain reduction. Efficacy of the conservative treatment is a matter of debate. Microcannular tumescent liposuction is the most effective therapeutic option for lipedema. There is a large body of evidence that this procedure significantly reduces pain in patients with lipedema.",

      "abstract": "The Scandinavian winter-swimming culture combines brief dips in cold water with hot sauna sessions, with conceivable effects on body temperature. We study thermogenic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in experienced winter-swimming men performing this activity 2-3 times per week. Our data suggest a lower thermal comfort state in the winter swimmers compared with controls, with a lower core temperature and absence of BAT activity. In response to cold, we observe greater increases in cold-induced thermogenesis and supraclavicular skin temperature in the winter swimmers, whereas BAT glucose uptake and muscle activity increase similarly to those of the controls. All subjects demonstrate nocturnal reduction in supraclavicular skin temperature, whereas a distinct peak occurs at 4:30-5:30 a.m. in the winter swimmers. Our data leverage understanding of BAT in adult human thermoregulation, suggest both heat and cold acclimation in winter swimmers, and propose winter swimming as a potential strategy for increasing energy expenditure.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the use of the ketogenic diet as a proper nutritional treatment for lipedema has been hypothesized in the literature. This is the first clinical study evaluating the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy in lipedema patients. In the present study, it was decided to use a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in combination with carboxytherapy. Since lipedema is characterized by microangiopathy, local hypoxia, and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) deposition, carboxytherapy could improve painful symptoms and skin tone. A total of 22 subjects were included in the data analysis, divided into three groups; 8 patients underwent MMKD combined with carboxytherapy sessions (KDCB group), 8 underwent MMKD nutritional treatment alone (KD group), and 6 patients underwent only carboxytherapy sessions (CB group), for a total of 10 weeks of treatment for all three groups. It was observed that the ketogenic diet effectively induced weight and fat mass loss, including in the limbs, areas considered unresponsive to diet therapy in lipedema patients. However, the best results were obtained from the combination of the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy, which showed improvements in both body composition and skin texture and a reduction in pain, along with an improvement in sleep quality. It would be helpful to conduct a clinical trial on a larger scale and over a more extended period to observe the results in the long term as well.",

      "title": "Trapped fat: Obesity pathogenesis as an intrinsic disorder in metabolic fuel partitioning.",
      "abstract": "Our understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity remains at best incomplete despite a century of research. During this time, two alternative perspectives have helped shape thinking about the etiology of the disorder. The currently prevailing view holds that excessive fat accumulation results because energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, with excessive food consumption being the primary cause of the imbalance. The other perspective attributes the initiating cause of obesity to intrinsic metabolic defects that shift fuel partitioning from pathways for mobilization and oxidation to those for synthesis and storage. The resulting reduction in fuel oxidation and trapping of energy in adipose tissue drives a compensatory increase in energy intake and, under some conditions, a decrease in expenditure. This theory of obesity pathogenesis has historically garnered relatively less attention despite its pedigree. Here, we present an updated comprehensive formulation of the fuel partitioning theory, focused on evidence gathered over the last 80 years from major animal models of obesity showing a redirection of fuel fluxes from oxidation to storage and accumulation of excess body fat with energy intake equal to or even less than that of lean animals. The aim is to inform current discussions about the etiology of obesity and by so doing, help lay new foundations for the design of more efficacious approaches to obesity research, treatment and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Lipedema is a lipodystrophic disease that is typically characterized by a marked increase in lower-body subcutaneous adipose tissue that is purported to have increased inflammation and fibrosis, have impaired microvascular/lymphatic circulation, and be resistant to reduction by weight loss therapy. However, these outcomes have not been adequately studied. We evaluated body composition, insulin sensitivity, metabolic health, and adipose tissue biology in women with obesity and lipedema (Obese-LIP) before and after moderate (∼9%) diet-induced weight loss. At baseline, people with Obese-LIP had ∼23% greater leg fat mass, ∼11% lower android-to-gynoid ratio, and ∼48% greater insulin sensitivity (all P < 0.05) than women matched on age, BMI, and whole-body adiposity. In Obese-LIP, macrophage content and expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis were greater, whereas lymph/angiogenesis-related genes were lower in thigh than abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Weight loss improved insulin sensitivity and decreased total fat mass, with similar relative reductions in abdominal and leg fat masses, but without changes in markers of inflammation and fibrosis. These results demonstrate that affected adipose tissue in women with lipedema is characterized by increased inflammation and fibrogenesis, and alterations in lymphatic and vascular biology. Moderate diet-induced weight loss improves metabolic function and decreases lower-body adipose tissue mass.",

      "abstract": "Obesity can mediate the occurrence of many cardiovascular metabolic diseases, such as coronary heart disease and diabetes, which will lead to a significant increase in all-cause mortality in obese people. Visceral fat refers to the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in abdominal organs, which can lead to impaired normal function of organs. In recent years, it has been reported that probiotics can reduce obesity and visceral fat content, and some studies have put forward the opposite conclusion. In order to guide the practice of nutrition, we use Meta-analysis method to analyze these conclusions. The authors searched randomized controlled trials on the effects of oral probiotics on body weight and visceral fat content in obese people published before January 2024 in several public databases, such as PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and CNKI. The primary outcome was body weight, and the secondary outcomes included BMI, waist circumference, visceral fat content, and low-density lipoprotein levels. This trial has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024521353). A total of 8 randomized controlled trials involving 412 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that the weight loss of the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.00001). The reduction of waist circumference in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P = 0.01). The decrease of visceral fat content in the experimental group taking probiotics was significantly different from that in the control group (P < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in BMI and LDL-C levels between the experimental group and the control group. Oral probiotics can reduce weight loss, waist circumference and visceral fat content in obese patients, which may be a potential nutritional treatment for obese patients in the future. However, whether oral probiotics can reduce BMI and LDL-C levels in obese patients needs to be included in more RCTs and further discussed in the future.",

      "abstract": "Adipose tissue, or body fat, plays a critical role in the maintenance of health and the development of metabolic diseases. The pathological expansion of adipose tissue during obesity and the pathological reduction of adipose tissue during lipodystrophy can lead to a similar array of metabolic diseases that include diabetes, but mechanisms remain to be fully defined. In our recent studies, we explored the contribution of the lipid kinase PIK3C3/VPS34 to adipose tissue health and metabolic disease. We found that adipocyte-specific PIK3C3/VPS34 deficiency causes defects in the differentiation, survival and functional properties of adipocytes, resulting in reduced adipose tissue mass, altered blood lipid levels, fatty liver disease, diabetes, and defective body temperature control. These abnormalities mirror those observed in patients with lipodystrophy. These findings identify adipocyte PIK3C3/VPS34 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.",

      "title": "The Effects of Intermittent Cold Exposure on Adipose Tissue.",
      "abstract": "Intermittent cold exposure (ICE) has garnered increased attention in popular culture, largely for its proposed effects on mood and immune function, but there are also suggestions that the energy-wasting mechanisms associated with thermogenesis may decrease body weight and fat mass. Considering the continued and worsening prevalence of obesity and type II diabetes, any protocol that can reduce body weight and/or improve metabolic health would be a substantial boon. Here, we present a narrative review exploring the research related to ICE and adipose tissue. Any publicly available original research examining the effects of repeated bouts of ICE on adipose-related outcomes was included. While ICE does not consistently lower body weight or fat mass, there does seem to be evidence for ICE as a positive modulator of the metabolic consequences of obesity, such as glucose tolerance and insulin signaling. Further, ICE consistently increases the activity of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and transitions white adipose tissue to a phenotype more in line with BAT. Lastly, the combined effects of ICE and exercise do not seem to provide any additional benefit, at least when exercising during ICE bouts. The majority of the current literature on ICE is based on rodent models where animals are housed in cold rooms, which does not reflect protocols likely to be implemented in humans such as cold water immersion. Future research could specifically characterize ICE via cold water immersion in combination with controlled calorie intake to clearly determine the effects of ICE as it would be implemented in humans looking to lower their body weight via reductions in fat mass.",

Its bulk is mostly deep facial fat immediately superficial to the buccinator muscle.

It can be removed in patients with round, heavy faces and anterior buccal fullness to slim the lower face and contour the jawline. This article describes the authors' technique for buccal fat pad removal, with a goal of conservative fat pad reduction.",

      "title": "How does adipose tissue contribute to inflammageing?",
      "abstract": "Across aging, white adipose tissue (WAT) undergoes significant changes in quantity and distribution, with an increase in visceral adipose tissue, ectopic fat deposition and a decline in gluteofemoral subcutaneous depot. In particular, WAT becomes dysfunctional with an increase in production of inflammatory peptides and a decline of those with anti-inflammatory activity and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Moreover, dysfunction of WAT is characterized by preadipocyte differentiation decline, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction in vascularization and hypoxia, increased fibrosis and senescent cell accumulation. WAT changes represent an important hallmark of the aging process and may be responsible for the systemic pro-inflammatory state (\"inflammageing\") typical of aging itself, leading to age-related metabolic alterations. This review focuses on mechanisms linking age-related WAT changes to inflammageing.",

      "title": "Hepatocyte-specific fibroblast growth factor 21 overexpression ameliorates high-fat diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis in mice.",
      "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is an endocrine growth factor mainly secreted by the liver in response to a ketogenic diet and alcohol consumption. FGF21 signaling requires co-receptor β-klotho (KLB) co-acting with FGF receptors, which has pleiotropic metabolic effects, including induced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis, in human and animal models of obesity. We examined the hepatocyte-specific enhancer/promoter of FGF21 expression plasmids in high-fat diet-fed mice for 12 weeks. Hydrodynamic injection for FGF21 delivery every 6 weeks sustained high circulating levels of FGF21, resulting in marked reductions in body weight, epididymal fat mass, insulin resistance, and liver steatosis. FGF21-induced lipolysis in the adipose tissue enabled the liver to be flooded with fat-derived FFAs. The hepatic expression of Glut2 and Bdh1 was upregulated, whereas that of gluconeogenesis-related genes, G6p and Pepck, and lipogenesis-related genes, Srebp-1 and Srebp-2, was significantly suppressed. FGF21 induced the phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172 and Raptor at ser792 and suppressed that of mTOR at ser2448, which downregulated mTORC1 signaling and reduced IRS-1 phosphorylation at ser1101. Finally, in the skeletal muscle, FGF21 increased Glut4 and Mct2, a membrane protein that acts as a carrier for ketone bodies. Enzymes for ketone body catabolism (Scot) and citrate cycle (Cs, Idh3a), and a marker of regenerating muscle (myogenin) were also upregulated via increased KLB expression. Thus, FGF21-induced lipolysis was continuously induced by a high-fat diet and fat-derived FFAs might cause liver damage. Hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body synthesis may act as hepatic FFAs' disposal mechanisms and contribute to improved liver steatosis. Liver-derived ketone bodies might be used for energy in the skeletal muscle. The potential FGF21-related crosstalk between the liver and extraliver organs is a promising strategy to prevent and treat metabolic syndrome-related nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.",

Surgical options carry disadvantages, such as the usage of anesthetics, swelling, pain and long time for recovery, so there is a growing public request for the techniques with fewer side effects and shorter recovery periods. Several new noninvasive body contouring ways have been advanced such as, cryolipolysis radiofrequency energy, suction-massage, high-frequency focused ultrasound, and laser therapy. Noninvasive laser improves the body's appearance by the elimination of excess adipose tissue, specifically in areas in which fat perseveres in spite of diet and exercise.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for noninvasive aesthetic treatments has increased significantly. New systems and technological innovations open new possibilities for practitioners and patients in the field of body contouring, noninvasive face lifting, skin tightening and rejuvenation, as well as effective therapies for urinary incontinence or erectile dysfunction. Currently, the most well-known innovations include technologies such as high-intensity focused electromagnetic field (HIFEM™) and radiofrequency (RF), which, after more than 30 years of research, could be combined in the RF-SYNCHRODE™ (BTL Medizintechnik GmbH, Prague, Czech republic) without any health risks for the patient. This allows the reduction of adipose tissue and the building of muscle in a single treatment. The newer HIFES™ technology was developed specifically for the treatment of the facial area and facial muscles. It is used with synchronized radiofrequency for noninvasive, painless face lifting and skin tightening, and is also suitable for botulinum toxin patients. Visible, noticeable, and long-lasting treatment results are achieved without significant side effects after only 4-6 sessions. These noninvasive, FDA(Food and Drug Administration)- and CE-certified systems are used in everyday practice and clinical routine in dermatology, gynecology, urology, and physiotherapy and represent a real alternative to invasive aesthetic plastic surgery.",

      "abstract": "Dicarboxylic fatty acids are generated in the liver and kidney in a minor pathway called fatty acid ω-oxidation. The effects of consuming dicarboxylic fatty acids as an alternative source of dietary fat have not been explored. Here, we fed dodecanedioic acid, a 12-carbon dicarboxylic (DC12), to mice at 20% of daily caloric intake for 9 weeks. DC12 increased metabolic rate, reduced body fat, reduced liver fat, and improved glucose tolerance. We observed DC12-specific breakdown products in liver, kidney, muscle, heart, and brain, indicating that oral DC12 escaped first-pass liver metabolism and was utilized by many tissues. In tissues expressing the \"a\" isoform of acyl-CoA oxidase-1 (ACOX1), a key peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation enzyme, DC12 was chain shortened to the TCA cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA. In tissues with low peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation capacity, DC12 was oxidized by mitochondria. In vitro, DC12 was catabolized even by adipose tissue and was not stored intracellularly. We conclude that DC12 and other dicarboxylic acids may be useful for combatting obesity and for treating metabolic disorders.",

Given its rapid metabolism, clinical measurability, and modifiability, epicardial fat works well as therapeutic target of drugs modulating the adipose tissue. Epicardial fat responds to glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1A) and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). GLP-1A and SGLT2i provide weight loss and cardiovascular protective effects beyond diabetes control, as recently demonstrated. The potential of modulating the epicardial fat morphology and genetic profile with targeted pharmacological agents can open new avenues in the pharmacotherapy of diabetes and obesity, with particular focus on cardiovascular risk reduction.",

      "abstract": "The demand for body fat reduction is increasing. However, conventional lipolytic approaches fail to control adipose tissue reduction and cause severe side effects in adjacent nonadipose tissues. A strategy to specifically reduce subcutaneous fat using adipocytolytic polymer nanoparticles in a minimally invasive manner is reported here. The polymer nanoparticles are designed to generate carbon dioxide gas when selectively absorbed by adipocytes. The carbon dioxide gas generated within late endosomes/lysosomes induces adipocytolysis, thereby reducing the number of cells. Localized injection of the adipocytolytic nanoparticles substantially reduces subcutaneous fat in a high-fat diet-induced obese mouse model, without significant changes in hematological or serum biochemical parameters. The adipocytolytic efficacy of the nanoparticles is also evaluated in a porcine model. This strategy addresses the need to develop safe and effective adipocytolytic agents using functional polymer nanoparticles.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is associated with higher risks of cardiac arrhythmias. Although this may be partly explained by concurrent cardiometabolic ill-health, growing evidence suggests that increasing adiposity independently confers risk for arrhythmias. Among fat depots, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) exhibits a proinflammatory secretome and, given the lack of fascial separation, has been implicated as a transducer of inflammation to the underlying myocardium. The present review explores the mechanisms underpinning adverse electrophysiological remodeling as a consequence of EAT accumulation and the consequent inflammation. We first describe the physiological and pathophysiological function of EAT and its unique secretome and subsequently discuss the evidence for ionic channel and connexin expression modulation as well as fibrotic remodeling induced by cytokines and free fatty acids that are secreted by EAT. Finally, we highlight how weight reduction and regression of EAT volume may cause reverse remodeling to ameliorate arrhythmic risk.",

Selenium-enriched cultivation can significantly improve the contents of vitamins and functional elements in kiwifruits, especially vitamin C, selenium, and manganese, thus enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in Se-Kiwi. Se-Kiwi can significantly improve the activity of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of hyperlipidaemic mice, restore the liver morphology of mice close to normal, reduce the fat content in the liver, and inhibit the accumulation of abdominal fat cells. Meanwhile, the expression levels of inflammation-related factors (TNF-α and NF-κB) and lipid synthesis related genes (SREBP-1c and FAS) are inhibited at the gene transcription and protein expression levels, and the expression levels of energy expenditure related genes (PPAR-α and CPT1) are increased, resulting in lipid reductions and liver protection. In conclusion, our results indicate that the protective mechanism of Se-Kiwi on high-fat diet mice is associated with enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, reducing the degree of the inflammatory reaction, inhibiting the fat synthesis, and accelerating body energy consumption.",

      "abstract": "In order to solve the relationship between youth aerobic exercise and obesity reduction, an improved ant colony algorithm-oriented aerobic exercise method was proposed. Firstly, the changes in body shape, weight, BMI, body fat, body circumference, and other indicators of obese adolescents before and after aerobic exercise were used as the initial pheromone distribution matrix, and the random evolution factor and evolutionary drift threshold were introduced to establish the target function of reducing obesity caused by aerobic exercise in adolescents. The constraint conditions of the relationship between aerobic exercise and adolescent obesity reduction were explained, and the particle algorithm was introduced to establish the optimal model of aerobic exercise for adolescent obesity reduction. The experimental results show that with the increasing number of experiments, the advantages of this method are more obvious. From the overall level, the average modeling error of this method is about 0.053%, while the average error of the traditional method is about 0.186%, which shows that this method can control the error within a reasonable range, and it is proved that the improved ant colony algorithm can have a good correlation with the method of aerobic exercise.",

TRF trials (mainly 16:8 model, with a duration of 5-48 weeks) reported a significant weight loss (1.2-10.2%, ~ 1.4-9.4 kg), with a considerable decrease in total fat mass (1.6-21%, ~ 0.5-7 kg) and visceral adipose compartment (VAC, 11-27%) in overweight and obese subjects. Experimental TRF in normal-fed and obesogenic-diet-fed mice and rats (with a fasting duration ranging between 9 and 21 h within 1-17 weeks) reported a significant reduction in body weight (~ 7-40%), total fat mass (~ 17-71%), and intrahepatic fat (~ 25-72%). TRF also improves VAC and subcutaneous adipose compartment (SAC) function by decreasing adipocyte size, macrophage infiltration, M1-macrophage polarity, and downregulating inflammatory genes. In conclusion, beyond its effect on body weight loss, total fat mass, and intrahepatic fat accumulation, TRF favors adipose organ fat redistribution in overweight and obese subjects by decreasing VAC and improving the function of VAC and SAC.",

      "abstract": "Integrative top-down proteomics is an analytical approach that fully addresses the breadth and complexity needed for effective and routine assessment of proteomes. Nonetheless, any such assessments also require a rigorous review of methodology to ensure the deepest possible quantitative proteome analyses. Here, we establish an optimized general protocol for proteome extracts to improve the reduction of proteoforms and, thus, resolution in 2DE. Dithiothreitol (DTT), tributylphosphine (TBP), and 2-hydroxyethyldisulfide (HED), combined and alone, were tested in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (1DE), prior to implementation into a full 2DE protocol. Prior to sample rehydration, reduction with 100 mM DTT + 5 mM TBP yielded increased spot counts, total signal, and spot circularity (i.e., decreased streaking) compared to other conditions and reduction protocols reported in the literature. The data indicate that many widely implemented reduction protocols are significantly 'under-powered' in terms of proteoform reduction and thus, limit the quality and depth of routine top-down proteomic analyses.",

      "abstract": "Dry blood spots (DBS) offer many advantages over other blood banking protocols due to the reduction of time and equipment needed for collection and the ease of processing, storage, and shipment. In addition, the sample size makes it a very attractive method when considering the banking of small pediatric samples. On that note, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) preanalytical standards for DBS are commonly used in the worldwide mass spectrometry-based inborn errors of metabolism screening programs. However, these guidelines may not apply for analytes and protocols not included in these programs. In fact, the availability of leftover samples and the ongoing interest in protocols outside this scenario are providing us with new DBS biobanking insights. Herein, we review the literature for indicators that should be considered in the design of prospective fit for purpose DBS biobanks, especially for those focused mostly on pediatric and OMIC platforms.",

Small, limited case series suggest that centromedian thalamus deep brain stimulation (CM-DBS) may be an effective treatment option. The optimal CM-DBS target for IGE is underexamined. Here, we present a retrospective analysis of CM-DBS targeting and efficacy for five patients with drug-resistant IGE. Volume of tissue activated (VTA) overlap with CM nucleus was performed using an open-source toolbox. Median follow-up time was 13 months. Median convulsive seizure frequency reduction was 66%. One patient had only absence seizures, with >99% reduction in absence seizure frequency. Four patients had electrode contacts positioned within the CM nucleus target, all of whom had >50% reduction in primary semiology seizure, with 85% median seizure reduction (p = .004, paired-sample t test). Volumetric \"sweet-spot\" mapping revealed that best outcomes were correlated with stimulation of the middle ventral CM nucleus. Connectivity strength between the sweet-spot region and central peri-Rolandic cortex was increased significantly relative to other cortical regions (p = 8.6 × 10",

However, their environmental impacts are often shadowed due to national security reasons. The current paper aims to go through the devastating impacts of military operations and wars on climate change and biodiversity loss and challenges that hinder the inclusion of military-related activities into environmental crisis mitigation efforts. The information blind spot induced by concerns about national security reasons jeopardizes the efforts to involve the military-industrial complex and military operations in the global climate and biodiversity agendas. Besides that, many military-related challenges, such as specificity of operational requirements and lifecycles, dependence on fossil fuels, complex supply change, inadequate civilian technologies and innovations, and requirements of structural changes, can hinder emission reduction. Meanwhile, wars and conflicts not only threaten to drain all human and material resources available to tackle environmental problems but also inflict long-lasting destructions, pains, and trauma that can lead to hatred and distrust among nations and parties. With the rising hatred and distrust, global agreement and commitment to address climate change and biodiversity will hardly be achieved. Thus, promoting peace is the humanistic and planetary conscience.",

Lockdowns were imposed throughout countries and even Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) affected patients had to face it and adapt, with management strategies changes coming along. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine (Phe) metabolism causing, when not treated, blood Phe increases and consequent central nervous system (CNS) damage. Dietary intervention is the main recognized treatment and must be maintained long-life, however adherence is often suboptimal in adulthood.

      "title": "The Attitude of Physicians Towards Female Genital Cosmetic Surgery.",
      "abstract": "Introduction Female genital cosmetic surgery (FGCS) is a trending topic in the field of gynecology practice. It is defined as any genital procedure that is not medically indicated but is designed to improve the appearance of the genitals. With the increasing demand for FGCS, little is known about the attitudes of physicians, especially gynecologists, toward FGCS. The study objective is to assess physicians' attitudes towards female genital cosmetic surgeries in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was done among physicians in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Four-sectioned questionnaires were distributed to physicians. All board-certified consultants and registrars of obstetrics and gynecology, plastic, and reconstructive surgery in private/public hospitals were included in the study. Data management was done using the SPSS program version 19 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results Out of 165 physicians, 40 were practicing physicians (female genital cosmetic surgery) (24.2%) while 125 were non-practicing physicians (75.8%). The age of practicing and non-practicing respondents ranges from 26 to 60 with a mean and standard deviation (42.6±8.6) and 24 to 60 (40.1±8.9) years old. Our study showed that there were females under 18 years old requesting FGCS from all physicians. Results of attitude towards FGCS showed that the majority of non-practicing physicians were more comfortable in providing advice about FGCS (N=53) and very confident about female anatomy (N=65). Non-practicing physicians also knew a lot more about the long and short-term risks of FGCS and discussed them all the time with their patients. In terms of giving advice on labiaplasty, clitoral hood reduction, perineoplasty, hymenoplasty, and G-spot augmentation procedures, practicing physicians were more confident compared to non-practicing physicians. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between practicing and non-practicing physicians in terms of gender (p=0.001), career level (p=0.005) and type of work (p=0.006), giving advice on labiaplasty (p=0.001), clitoral hood reduction (p=0.001), perineoplasty (p=0.016) and G-spot augmentation (p=0.001), the number of patients per month, patients seeking advice about FGCS, knowledge about short-term and long-term risks and possible risks of FGCS, vaginal examination, offering referral/counseling and confidence in assessing female anatomy (all, p=0.001).  Conclusion Physicians in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia showed an overall positive attitude towards FGCS. The study suggests that with enough training and knowledge about FGCS, physicians could exhibit a more positive attitude towards FGCS.",

      "abstract": "Adequate intake of iodine is important during pregnancy because of its essential role in foetal growth and neurodevelopment. Data on iodine status of South African pregnant women are scarce, and the salt reduction policy implemented in 2016 may decrease iodine intake of South Africans. This cross-sectional study assessed the iodine status of pregnant women residing in urban Johannesburg, South Africa. A total of 250 pregnant women were enrolled into the 'Nutrition during Pregnancy and Early Development' (NuPED) study and 312 pregnant women into the 'Assessment of dried blood spot thyroglobulin in pregnant women to redefine the range of median urinary iodine concentration that indicates adequate iodine intake, South Africa' (STRIPE-SA) study and were included in this analysis. Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was analysed in a spot urine sample. Thyroglobulin (Tg) was measured in serum, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and total thyroxine (tT4) were measured in dried blood spots. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] UIC of pregnant women was 144 (84-234) μg/L. Women in the first (n = 99), second (n = 262) and third (n = 174) trimester had a median UIC of 133 (81-316), 145 (84-236) and 156 (89-245) μg/L, respectively (p = 0.419). Median TSH, tT4 and Tg were 2.7 (2.3-3.2) mU/L, 202 (163-236) nmol/L and 9.2 (5.4-17.9) μg/L, respectively. Based on the median UIC, pregnant women residing in urban Johannesburg may be borderline iodine deficient. These findings highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of iodine status among vulnerable pregnant women, especially considering the recently introduced salt reduction policy in South Africa.",

      "abstract": "Collisions with wild animals on high-speed expressways not only lead to roadkill but can also cause accidents that incur considerable human and economic costs. Based on roadkill data from 2004-2019 for four common wildlife species involved in collisions with vehicles on expressways in Korea (water deer, common raccoon dog, Korean hare, and wild boar), the present study conducted optimized hotspot analysis and identified spatiotemporal patterns using a space-time cube (STC) approach. Temporal and spatial differences in the roadkill data were observed between species. Water deer were the most common roadkill species of the four studied, with hotspots in the southern region of the capital area, in the Chungnam region, and in the western Chungbuk and Gangwon-do regions. However, the instances of water deer roadkill over time differed between each region. In addition, it was found that the number of cases of wild boar roadkill has increased recently. In particular, a number of new hotspot areas were observed centered on the metropolitan area Gyeonggi-do, which contains a high population and significant infrastructure. Overall, the emerging hotspot analysis based on STCs was able to determine cold spot and hotspot trends over time, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of spatiotemporal clustering patterns and associated changes than cumulative density-oriented hotspot analysis. As a result, it becomes easier to analyze the causes of roadkill and to establish reduction measures according to priority.",

Metallic oxides nanoparticles present a new approach to the control of plant pathogens. ZnO nanoparticles (ZNPs) have very important role in phytopathology. In current study, biosynthesized ZNPs were tested against two devastating bacterial pathogens including Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and Ralstonia solanacearum causing bacterial leaf spot and bacterial wilt in tomato. ZNPs were produced using a new extract from the plant Picea smithiana using an environmentally friendly, cost-effective and simple procedure. Zinc acetate was added to P. smithiana extract, stirred and heated to 200 °C. The white precipitation at the bottom were clear indication of synthesis of nanoparticles, which were further dried by subjecting them at 450 °C. X-ray diffraction pattern determined that the ZNPs had a crystallite size of about 26 nm, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated a peak between 450 and 550 cm",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization recommended reducing one's salt intake below 5 g/day to prevent disability and death from cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. This review aimed to identify salt estimation at the population level in South Asian countries, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. We searched electronic databases and government websites for the literature and reports published between January 2011 and October 2021 and also consulted key informants for unpublished reports. We included studies that assessed salt intake from urinary sodium excretion, either spot urine or a 24 h urine sample, on a minimum of 100 samples in South Asian countries. We included 12 studies meeting the criteria after screening 2043 studies, out of which five followed nationally representative methods. This review revealed that salt intake in South Asian countries ranges from 6.7-13.3 g/day. The reported lowest level of salt intake was in Bangladesh and India, and the highest one was in Nepal. The estimated salt intake reported in the nationally representative studies were ranging from 8 g/day (in India) to 12.1 g/day (in Afghanistan). Salt consumption in men (8.9-12.5 g/day) was reported higher than in women (7.1-12.5 g/day). Despite the global target of population salt intake reduction, people in South Asian countries consume a much higher amount of salt than the WHO-recommended level.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Alternaria and Septoria leaf spot severity on sunflower yield across different years in a humid subtropical climate. We conducted 37 experiments in Santa Maria, RS, Brazil, over 7 years. The hybrids Embrapa 122, Helio 358, Aguará 03, and Altis 99 were sowed and managed according to national crop recommendations. Severity assessments for Alternaria and Septoria spots were performed at 2- to 7-day intervals using a diagrammatic scale. We evaluated the effects of Alternaria and Septoria leaf spot severity on crop yield using upper limit graphs. The 37 experiments comprised 13 normal season crops (August to October) and 24 late season crops (November to February). The results were also classified according to the contemporaneous phases of the ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation): El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral. In normal season crops, severities of up to 24% do not result in yield decrease. After this, each 1% increment in disease severity produces a decrease of 66 kg ha",

The procedures that can be included under female cosmetic genital surgery are the following: reduction labiaplasty, vaginoplasty, hymenoplasty, \"G-Spot amplification\", and miscellaneous. Those who support these procedures could argue that women undergo such procedures as a matter of choice, whereas those opposed could argue that this choice is made because of society's fascination with physical appearance and feeling young. Prima facie these procedures appear to contradict the Hippocratic principle of \"primum non nocere\". There has been an increase in the marketing and conduct of the above mentioned procedures. Practitioners need to be both sceptical and cautious while performing these surgeries. Patients requesting them need to be counseled regarding the lack of data supporting their efficacy, and the potential complications of the procedures.",

      "title": "Acute Idiopathic Blind Spot Enlargement Syndrome-New Perspectives in the OCT Era.",
      "abstract": "Acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome (AIBSES) is characterized by unilateral visual field loss in the blind spot area, acute onset photopsia, and funduscopically few or no optic disc changes. AIBSES predominantly affects young adults and is often misdiagnosed as optic neuritis because of low awareness. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become the gold standard in diagnosing AIBSES as a disease of the outer retina. In our case series, we present three consecutive patients with AIBSES followed prospectively with and without steroid therapy. The patients, aged 25 to 27 years, presented in our neuroophthalmology department between 2020 and 2021. We report their disease course and management and discuss therapeutic options, as no well-established procedures exist. Common pitfalls and diagnostic errors are analysed. Two women and one man showed unilateral acute-onset photopsia and blind spot enlargement on perimetry without visual acuity reduction. Spectral domain OCT (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) revealed marked peripapillary changes in the ellipsoid zone and autofluorescence in all patients, corresponding to faint blurring of the optic disc margin. Characteristically, there was no P100 latency delay in the visual evoked potential in any of the patients. Two patients received weight-adapted oral prednisolone, which was gradually tapered over six to eight weeks. Two patients showed full recovery of their symptoms at six and seven months after onset, while mild defect healing was seen in one treated patient after 12 months. Follow-up OCT showed restoration of the outer retinal layers 6-12 months after disease onset. Careful history taking and an unprejudiced ophthalmological workup helps in diagnosing AIBSES in young adults with unilateral acute visual field defects. While its etiology is still unclear, accurate diagnosis of AIBSES can be made with peripapillary OCT. In our cases, the disease course of AIBSES was much better than its reputation. Early corticosteroid treatment may support outer retinal reorganisation, which can be followed with OCT in accordance with visual field restoration. This should be addressed in a prospective study.",

      "abstract": "Reducing salt and increasing potassium intake are recommended lifestyle modifications for patients with hypertension. The estimated 24-h urinary salt excretion value from spot urine using Tanaka's formula and the salt check-sheet scores, questionnaire-based scores of salt intake, are practical indices of daily salt intake. However, few studies have evaluated salt intake with these methods in hypertensive outpatients. We examined salt and potassium intake with the spot urine method and the salt check-sheet scores of hypertensive outpatients in a multi-facility, real-world setting and examined whether the salt or potassium intake evaluated with these methods related to inadequate blood pressure control. Hypertensive outpatients from 12 medical facilities in the Okinawa prefecture were enrolled from November 2011 to April 2014 (n = 1559, mean age 63.9 years, 46% women). The mean blood pressure, urinary salt excretion value, urinary potassium excretion value, and total score on the salt check-sheet were 129/75 mmHg, 8.7 g/day, 1.6 g/day, and 10.4 points, respectively. The urinary salt excretion value and total score on the salt check-sheet but not urinary potassium excretion value were associated with inadequate blood pressure control (≥140/90 mmHg). Higher body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary potassium excretion value, total score on the salt check-sheet, and presence of inadequate blood pressure control were associated with high urinary salt excretion (≥10.2 g/day). In conclusion, hypertensive outpatients with high urinary salt excretion values estimated using Tanaka's formula or with high scores on the salt check sheet may be candidates for more intensive salt reduction guidance.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the feasibility of classifying soybean frogeye leaf spot (FLS) is investigated. Leaf images and hyperspectral reflectance data of healthy and FLS diseased soybean leaves were acquired. First, image processing was used to classify FLS to create a reference for subsequent analysis of hyperspectral data. Then, dimensionality reduction methods of hyperspectral data were used to obtain the relevant information pertaining to FLS. Three single methods, namely spectral index (SI), principal component analysis (PCA), and competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), along with a PCA and SI combined method, were included. PCA was used to select the effective principal components (PCs), and evaluate SIs. Characteristic wavelengths (CWs) were selected using CARS. Finally, the full wavelengths, CWs, effective PCs, SIs, and significant SIs were divided into 14 datasets (DS1-DS14) and used as inputs to build the classification models. Models' performances were evaluated based on the classification accuracy for both the overall and individual classes. Our results suggest that the FLS comprised of five classes based on the proportion of total leaf surface covered with FLS. In the PCA and SI combination model, 5 PCs and 20 SIs with higher weight coefficient of each PC were extracted. For hyperspectral data, 20 CWs and 26 effective PCs were also selected. Out of the 14 datasets, the model input variables provided by five datasets (DS2, DS3, DS4, DS10, and DS11) were more superior than those of full wavelengths (DS1) both in support vector machine (SVM) and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifiers. The models developed using these five datasets achieved overall accuracies ranging from 91.8% to 94.5% in SVM, and 94.5% to 97.3% in LS-SVM. In addition, they improved the classification accuracies by 0.9% to 3.6% (SVM) and 0.9% to 3.7% (LS-SVM).",

      "abstract": "Tooth reduction guides allow clinicians to obtain the ideal space required for ceramic restorations. This case report describes a novel design (CAD) for an additive computer-aided manufactured (a-CAM) tooth reduction guide with channels that permitted access for the preparation and evaluation of the reduction with the same guide. The guide features innovative vertical and horizontal channels that permit comprehensive access for preparation and evaluation of the reduction with a periodontal probe, ensuring uniform tooth reduction and avoiding overpreparation. This approach was successfully applied to a female patient with non-carious lesions and white spot lesions, resulting in minimally invasive tooth preparations and hand-crafted laminate veneer restorations that met the patient's aesthetic demands while preserving tooth structure. Compared to traditional silicone reduction guides, this novel design offers greater flexibility, enabling clinicians to evaluate tooth reduction in all directions and providing a more comprehensive assessment. Overall, this 3D printed tooth reduction guide represents a significant advancement in dental restoration technology, offering clinicians a useful tool for achieving optimal outcomes with minimal tooth reduction. Future work is warranted to compare tooth reductions and preparation time for this guide to other 3D printed guides.",

Utilizing targeted cold exposure to adipose tissue, cryolipolysis devices induce cellular apoptosis in adipocytes while sparing surrounding tissues, resulting in the selective disruption of fat cells and subsequent removal of damaged cells by macrophages. A reduction of the fat layer produces a noninvasive cosmetic benefit that provides an accessible alternative to liposuction. Objective and subjective measurements have demonstrated significant reduction in fat volume and high patient satisfaction rates. Cryolipolysis has been proven to be safe with minimal adverse effects. However, further research is needed to fully understand the mechanism of cryolipolysis and its efficacy in different treatment areas. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of cryolipolysis, including its mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, adverse effects, results and outcomes, safety profile, and areas requiring further research.",

      "abstract": "The number of aesthetic procedures performed worldwide continues to grow together with an increase in the population seeking the restoration or preservation of a youthful appearance. Requests for non-surgical body rejuvenation are increasing. Patients are looking for safe and effective minimally invasive aesthetic procedures. Soft-tissue dermal fillers can meet these expectations. Based on the beneficial outcomes of these treatments in many facial areas, a new trend is developing to target body areas. Different dermal fillers are available and include collagen stimulators initially developed to restore facial volume. Furthermore, they are associated with long-lasting efficiency, a high level of patient satisfaction and a good safety profile, with mainly minor adverse events reported. In appropriate conditions of use, they are now used for body rejuvenation in clinical practice. Their use is expanding and allows addressing various issues including volume loss, skin laxity, cellulite, striae distensae and wrinkles. This review focuses on poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), used in the first collagen stimulator and one of the most investigated in facial and in off-facial body applications. The available published data, although still limited, are presented by body area, neck and chest, buttocks, abdomen, upper arms, thighs, knees, and hands. Key features of the concerned zones and the main clinical signs affecting the body part as well as the injection modalities are provided along with the aesthetic results. This represents the state of the art on which to base further developments necessary for optimal and safe outcomes of treatment with the PLLA-based collagen stimulators and others in this class for body rejuvenation.",

      "abstract": "Non-facial (body) rejuvenation is a treatment of increasing demand, with patients seeking to harmonize the benefits of rejuvenated facial appearance with other areas of the body. Poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)-SCA (Sculptra®) has been approved for facial aesthetic uses since 1999 in Europe and since 2009 in the USA and more recently evaluated for the treatment of cellulite of the buttocks and thighs and other body indications. The current evidence base consists largely of prospective observational analyses and case series although systematic evaluations for a number of body areas are underway. Current data support a potential benefit for the use of PLLA-SCA for the aesthetic treatment of the neck, knees, abdomen, hands and upper arms. Improvements in aesthetic appearance (e.g. sagging, wrinkling, dimpling, cellulite) that are sustained over time with minimal side effects can be achieved. Standardization of injection protocols for different body areas is now needed along with the validation of clinical tools that can be used to agree on treatment goals and to evaluate aesthetic improvements over time. A group of international experts in the fields of facial and body aesthetics, plastic surgery and dermatology were selected based on their educational, scientific and publication merits together with clinical experience using PLLA-SCA for body rejuvenation. Here, we provide an evidence-based and expert-led consensus (14 years of off-face treatment experience) on recommendations for appropriate injection protocols for different body sites and evaluation tools when using the biostimulator PLLA-SCA for body aesthetic and rejuvenation procedures.Level of Evidence IV This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

Surgeons interested in such cases must first understand the aesthetic ideals and principles of gluteal shaping as it pertains to men. By using gluteal implants, fat transfer techniques, local tissue rearrangement principles, or a combination thereof, one can sculpt an aesthetically pleasing male buttock with a high degree of patient satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Breast and body contouring procedures are plastic surgery's most popular and effective interventions. Although these procedures are generally safe, they are not without risks and complications. Antifibrinolytic drugs such as tranexamic acid (TXA) have been used as an adjunct to improve outcomes. The authors of this meta-analysis explore the impact of TXA on complications in breast and body contouring procedures. They searched PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) for studies that used TXA in standard breast reconstruction and body contouring procedures. They then performed a meta-analysis on the following complications: hematoma, seroma, infection, and wound-healing complications. A Mantel-Haenszel method random-effects model was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) within and a 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes. Subgroups were created for studies that utilized systemic (IV), topical or concurrent IV, and topical TXA administration. A total of 13 studies were selected and included in the analysis. There was a significant lower risk of hematoma (OR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.18-077; P = .008) in the TXA cohort. There were no significant differences observed in terms of wound-healing issues or seroma formation. The subgroup analysis of this study demonstrated significantly decreased risks of infection (OR = 0.41; 95% CI = 0.22-077; P = .005) in the topical TXA cohort. In breast and body contouring procedures, the risk of hematoma and wound-healing complications can potentially be reduced by IV TXA administration. The infection risk can be potentially reduced by topical TXA administration. Level of Evidence: 3 (Therapeutic).",

The goals of contouring are to optimize abdominal aesthetics while also addressing lateral thigh and buttock skin excess with an easily concealed scar. Key concepts in contemporary lower lift include a low anterior scar that gently slopes superior to help with waist accentuation and addressing lateral thigh contour. The posterior scar lies at the top of the gluteal crease to preserve the buttocks aesthetic unit, allow for autoaugmentation, and minimize wound-healing complications. Patient safety considerations include thromboembolism prevention, minimizing blood loss, and keeping the patient warm. With proper planning, the lower body lift effectively and aesthetically removes circumferential skin laxity.",

      "abstract": "The practice of large volume liposuction, when executed by board-certified plastic surgeons using a variety of energy-assisted liposuction devices, has been substantiated as a secure procedure, yielding enhanced aesthetic results and minimal complications. Techniques including the superwet technique and ultrasonic-assisted liposuction are utilized to diminish blood loss, while also maintaining a keen awareness of the maximum volume of infiltration fluid permissible for safe infusion. Adherence to evidence-based protocols is of paramount importance to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. These protocols encompass hypothermia prevention, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. To ensure the highest quality of care, it is recommended that large volume liposuction procedures be performed in accredited hospitals or certified ambulatory surgery centers. Postoperative procedures should include overnight admission of patients to facilitate proper hemodynamic monitoring. While the employment of multiple devices such as VASERLipo and Renuvion has been noted to augment skin and soft tissue contraction, it is worth noting that there may be a heightened risk of seroma formation (at 2.27%) and subcutaneous emphysema (at 1.47%). Consequently, prudent use of these advanced medical devices is essential to avoid any potential adverse events.",

Hormonal therapy can bring about a considerable change in the physical transformation. However, there is an increase in requests for specific body contouring procedures because of increased awareness in the society. There are significant differences between the skeletal as well as soft tissue characteristics of male and female body. Body contouring in transgender individuals can be achieved by altering the skeletal structure or the overlying soft tissues or combining both. In this article, we discuss body contouring as an adjunct to gender affirming surgeries, in both male to female and female to male transgender individuals.",

In literature are not described techniques to accomplish a sound aesthetic result in sculpting surgery about lower extremities.",

Fleur-de-lis abdominoplasty provides best vector correction with nice contouring results, especially for central body type patients, with superior waist definition with or without associated circumferential belt lipectomies. Special interest has been addressed on technical refinements to enhance vertical scar with neoumbilicoplasty as well as the mons pubis projection with marking and suturing refinements. Both the inner scar umbilicus and the monsplasty are simple, safe, and reproducible techniques, presenting low complication rates with sustainable and natural results.",

The focussing of sound waves according to the principle of a bundling of rays is carried out without injury to the skin. The penetration depth of the coagulation depends on the wavelength. Wavelengths that reach penetration depths of 6mm, 9mm and even 13mm and therefore deeper layers of the dermis and fat tissue are new. These enable fat cells to be eliminated and ultimately lead to girth reduction and also additionally to tightening. The effectiveness has been confirmed by several studies.",

With the increasing popularity of aesthetic treatments and the growing share of patients who are millennials, it is important for physicians to understand the current trends, which can offer insights to better forecast patient demand and optimize practice management. Although it has been anecdotally reported that the popularity of cosmetic procedures has increased with millennials, available data on consumer behavior is limited. Our data fills this gap in the literature by examining the patterns of cosmetic procedures in millennials and discussing reasons for these findings. Our data proves an overall upward trend and also breaks down these trends for various individual procedures. Physicians can utilize this information to optimize marketing strategies for millennials in order to capture greater market share and potentially increase practice revenues.",

      "abstract": "The recent demand for noninvasive fat reduction and muscle toning has generated the need for a variety of noninvasive body contouring devices, including cryolipolysis, radiofrequency, focused ultrasound, laser energy, and high intensity focused electromagnetic energy. Many of the recent technologies are still relatively new, and clinical trials are limited. There is also a lack of comparison between modalities, which makes it difficult for practitioners to select the best treatment option for patients. We review the currently available treatment modalities and offer relevant insights.",

Given that weight loss patients often have multiple concerns, combination procedures are often utilized and must be planned with the patient's goals and safety in mind.",

The emerging niche is distinct from the adult because its main role is to support the progenitors that build organ systems in development. Emerging niches mature through distinct stages to form the adult niche and enable proper stem cell support. As a model of emerging niches, this review highlights how differences in the skeletal muscle microenvironment influence emerging versus satellite cell (SC) niche formation in skeletal muscle, which is among the most regenerative tissue systems. We contrast how stem cell niches regulate intrinsic properties between progenitor and stem cells throughout development to adulthood. We describe new applications for generating emerging niches from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) using developmental principles and highlight potential applications for regeneration and therapeutics.",

      "title": "Exploring the Role of Sprint Biomechanics in Hamstring Strain Injuries: A Current Opinion on Existing Concepts and Evidence.",
      "abstract": "Hamstring strain injuries are one of the most common injuries in sprint-based sports with the mechanism of injury considered the result of an interaction between applied mechanical strain and the capacity of the muscle to tolerate strain. To date, injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies have frequently focused on enhancing the capacity of the hamstrings to tolerate strain, with little consideration of factors directly influencing mechanical strain. Sprint running biomechanics are one factor proposed to influence the mechanical strain applied to the hamstrings that may be modified (towards reduced strain) within rehabilitation and injury prevention programs. This article aims to explore the theoretical mechanistic link between sprint running mechanics and hamstring strain injury, along with the available supporting evidence. In doing so, it hopes to provide practitioners with an understanding of mechanical parameters that may influence hamstring strain injury whilst also identifying areas for further research exploration.",

      "abstract": "Short-term energy deficits impair anabolic hormones and muscle protein synthesis. However, the effects of prolonged energy deficits on resistance training (RT) outcomes remain unexplored. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of PubMed and SportDiscus for randomized controlled trials performing RT in an energy deficit (RT+ED) for ≥3 weeks. We first divided the literature into studies with a parallel control group without an energy deficit (RT+CON; Analysis A) and studies without RT+CON (Analysis B). Analysis A consisted of a meta-analysis comparing gains in lean mass (LM) and strength between RT+ED and RT+CON. Studies in Analysis B were matched with separate RT+CON studies for participant and intervention characteristics, and we qualitatively compared the gains in LM and strength between RT+ED and RT+CON. Finally, Analyses A and B were pooled into a meta-regression examining the relationship between the magnitude of the energy deficit and LM. Analysis A showed LM gains were impaired in RT+ED vs RT+CON (effect size (ES) = -0.57, p = 0.02), but strength gains were comparable between conditions (ES = -0.31, p = 0.28). Analysis B supports the impairment of LM in RT+ED (ES: -0.11, p = 0.03) vs RT+CON (ES: 0.20, p < 0.001) but not strength (RT+ED ES: 0.84; RT+CON ES: 0.81).

      "abstract": "Reviews focused on the ketogenic diet (KD) based on the increase in fat-free mass (FFM) have been carried out with pathological populations or, failing that, without population differentiation. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to verify whether a ketogenic diet without programmed energy restriction generates increases in fat-free mass (FFM) in resistance-trained participants. We evaluated the effect of the ketogenic diet, in conjunction with resistance training, on fat-free mass in trained participants. Boolean algorithms from various databases (PubMed, Scopus. and Web of Science) were used, and a total of five studies were located that related to both ketogenic diets and resistance-trained participants. In all, 111 athletes or resistance-trained participants (87 male and 24 female) were evaluated in the studies analyzed. We found no significant differences between groups in the FFM variables, and more research is needed to perform studies with similar ketogenic diets and control diet interventions. Ketogenic diets, taking into account the possible side effects, can be an alternative for increasing muscle mass as long as energy surplus is generated; however, their application for eight weeks or more without interruption does not seem to be the best option due to the satiety and lack of adherence generated.",

      "abstract": "Muscle injury classification systems for hamstring injuries have evolved to use anatomy and imaging information to aid management and prognosis. However, classification systems lack reliability and validity data and are not specific to individual hamstring muscles, potentially missing parameters vital for sport-specific and activity-specific decision making. A narrative evidence review was conducted followed by a modified Delphi study to build an international consensus on best-practice decision-making for the classification of hamstring injuries. This comprised a digital information gathering survey to a cohort of 46 international hamstring experts (sports medicine physicians, physiotherapists, surgeons, trainers and sports scientists) who were also invited to a face-to-face consensus group meeting in London . Fifteen of these expert clinicians attended to synthesise and refine statements around the management of hamstring injury. A second digital survey was sent to a wider group of 112 international experts. Acceptance was set at 70% agreement. Rounds 1 and 2 survey response rates were 35/46 (76%) and 99/112 (88.4%) of experts responding. Most commonly, experts used the British Athletics Muscle Injury Classification (BAMIC) (58%), Munich (12%) and Barcelona (6%) classification systems for hamstring injury. Issues identified to advance imaging classifications systems include: detailing individual hamstring muscles, establishing optimal use of imaging in diagnosis and classification, and testing the validity and reliability of classification systems. The most used hamstring injury classification system is the BAMIC. This consensus panel recommends hamstring injury classification systems evolve to integrate imaging and clinical parameters around: individual muscles, injury mechanism, sporting demand, functional criteria and patient-reported outcome measures. More research is needed on surgical referral and effectiveness criteria, and validity and reliability of classification systems to guide management.",

They were randomly divided into three groups: Group I underwent CR and IMT; Group II only CR; and patients in Group III underwent only the IMT. Before and after the 8-week cycle, participants were assessed for exercise tolerance and the functional parameters of respiratory muscle strength. Significant statistical improvement concerned the majority of the hemodynamic parameters, lung function parameters, and respiratory muscle strength in the first group. Moreover, the enhancement in the exercise tolerance in the CR + IMT group was accompanied by a negligible change in the HR",

      "abstract": "Studies suggest that inducing gut microbiota changes may alter both muscle physiology and cognitive behaviour. Gut microbiota may play a role in both anabolic resistance of older muscle, and cognition. In this placebo controlled double blinded randomised controlled trial of 36 twin pairs (72 individuals), aged ≥60, each twin pair are block randomised to receive either placebo or prebiotic daily for 12 weeks. Resistance exercise and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation is prescribed to all participants. Outcomes are physical function and cognition. The trial is carried out remotely using video visits, online questionnaires and cognitive testing, and posting of equipment and biological samples. The prebiotic supplement is well tolerated and results in a changed gut microbiome [e.g., increased relative Bifidobacterium abundance]. There is no significant difference between prebiotic and placebo for the primary outcome of chair rise time (β = 0.579; 95% CI -1.080-2.239 p = 0.494). The prebiotic improves cognition (factor score versus placebo (β = -0.482; 95% CI,-0.813, -0.141; p = 0.014)). Our results demonstrate that cheap and readily available gut microbiome interventions may improve cognition in our ageing population. We illustrate the feasibility of remotely delivered trials for older people, which could reduce under-representation of older people in clinical trials.

Several tests of RM function are available, including measurements of upright and supine vital capacity, inspiratory and expiratory muscle pressures, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure, sniff esophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressures, and peak cough flow. These tests are widely available but are effort dependent. Electrodiagnostic studies, such as electromyography, electrical, or magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation, are effort independent but require more specialized equipment and staff. Imaging techniques such as ultrasound provide helpful complementary information about diaphragm function.",

Building these models require an understanding of the length-tension (elastic) and force-velocity (viscous) relationships. Much work has been done to characterize these nonlinear functions, as they are influenced by innervation. However, the active force generator (active-state tension) in the muscle is still poorly understood. Thus, these models serve more to reveal where new studies of muscle behavior are needed than to explain what happens during a saccade.",

To date, the basic science research for treating muscle injuries with platelet-rich plasma or stem cell remains novel. Furthermore, there are even fewer clinical studies on these topics, and their findings are inconclusive. Reviewing the literature, muscle injuries treated with ultrasound-guided leukocyte-rich PRP injections appear to have the strongest evidence. Scar formation remains a major barrier in muscle injury healing, and there is optimism for future orthobiologic treatments that target the downregulation of TGF-B, resulting in decreased scar development.",

      "abstract": "Tissues undergo distinct morphogenetic processes to achieve similarly shaped structures. In the heart, cardiomyocytes in both the ventricle and atrium build internal structures for efficient contraction. Ventricular wall formation (trabeculation) is initiated by cardiomyocyte delamination. How cardiomyocytes build the atrial wall is poorly understood. Using longitudinal imaging in zebrafish, we found that at least 25% of the atrial cardiomyocytes elongate along the long axis of the heart. These cell shape changes result in cell intercalation and convergent thickening, leading to the formation of the internal muscle network. We tested factors important for ventricular trabeculation including Nrg/ErbB and Notch signaling and found no evidence for their role in atrial muscle network formation. Instead, our data suggest that atrial cardiomyocyte elongation is regulated by Yap, which has not been implicated in trabeculation. Altogether, these data indicate that distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms build the internal muscle structures in the atrium and ventricle.",

Significant improvements in pain, functional outcomes, and quality of life are achieved in patients treated nonoperatively.

      "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a major metabolic organ that uses mostly glucose and lipids for energy production and has the capacity to remodel itself in response to exercise and fasting. Skeletal muscle wasting occurs in many diseases and during aging. Muscle wasting is often accompanied by chronic low-grade inflammation associated to inter- and intra-muscular fat deposition. During aging, muscle wasting is advanced due to increased movement disorders, as a result of restricted physical exercise, frailty, and the pain associated with arthritis. Muscle atrophy is characterized by increased protein degradation, where the ubiquitin-proteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal pathways, atrogenes, and growth factor signaling all play an important role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, which are activated by fatty acids and their derivatives. PPARs regulate genes that are involved in development, metabolism, inflammation, and many cellular processes in different organs. PPARs are also expressed in muscle and exert pleiotropic specialized responses upon activation by their ligands. There are three PPAR isotypes, viz., PPARα, -β/δ, and -γ. The expression of PPARα is high in tissues with effective fatty acid catabolism, including skeletal muscle. PPARβ/δ is expressed more ubiquitously and is the predominant isotype in skeletal muscle. It is involved in energy metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, and fiber-type switching. The expression of PPARγ is high in adipocytes, but it is also implicated in lipid deposition in muscle and other organs. Collectively, all three PPAR isotypes have a major impact on muscle homeostasis either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, reciprocal interactions have been found between PPARs and the gut microbiota along the gut-muscle axis in both health and disease. Herein, we review functions of PPARs in skeletal muscle and their interaction with the gut microbiota in the context of muscle wasting.",

      "title": "Graham Hoyle (1923-1985): exploring the depths of muscle diversity.",
      "abstract": "Graham Hoyle was an important neuroscientist, muscle biologist, and zoologist throughout much of the second half of the twentieth century. A native of England, Hoyle studied under Bernard Katz in London before earning his D.Sc. in neurophysiology from the University of Glasgow. He immigrated to the United States in the mid-1950s and worked with C.A.G. Wiersma at Caltech, with whom he shared a love for crustacean neuromuscular physiology. Hoyle accepted a position at the University of Oregon in 1961 and remained there as a professor until his death in 1985 at the age of 61. Hoyle was active scientifically at a time when the basics of muscle biology were still being discovered. He made many important contributions to the field of neuromuscular physiology, particularly in the realm of comparative physiology. Hoyle was passionate about the importance of a comparative approach in physiology and emphasized that \"as a comparative physiologist, I value knowledge of the diverse forms not only for its own sake, but also because it embodies the general truth.\" Perhaps Hoyle's most lasting legacy is embodied in the many students and postdocs who trained with him early in their careers. Many of these young scientists went on to build prominent careers and trained numerous students of their own. In addition to offering an overview of Hoyle's career, this article revisits some of Hoyle's central contributions to muscle biology and assesses them in light of our current understanding of muscle structure and function.",

      "abstract": "Across the human body, skeletal muscles have a broad range of biomechanical roles that employ complex proprioceptive control strategies to successfully execute a desired movement. This information is derived from peripherally located sensory apparatus, the muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organs. The abundance of these sensory organs, particularly muscle spindles, is known to differ considerably across individual muscles. Here we present a comprehensive data set of 119 muscles across the human body including architectural properties (muscle fibre length, mass, pennation angle and physiological cross-sectional area) and statistically test their relationships with absolute spindle number and relative spindle abundance (the residual value of the linear regression of the log-transformed spindle number and muscle mass). These data highlight a significant positive relationship between muscle spindle number and fibre length, emphasising the importance of fibre length as an input into the central nervous system. However, there appears to be no relationship between muscles architecturally optimised to function as displacement specialists and their provision of muscle spindles. Additionally, while there appears to be regional differences in muscle spindle abundance, independent of muscle mass and fibre length, our data provide no support for the hypothesis that muscle spindle abundance is related to anatomical specialisation.",

      "abstract": "Muscle spindles, one of the two main classes of proprioceptors together with Golgi tendon organs, are sensory structures that keep the central nervous system updated about the position and movement of body parts. Although they were discovered more than 150 years ago, their function during movement is not yet fully understood. Here, we summarize the morphology and known functions of muscle spindles, with a particular focus on locomotion. Although certain properties such as the sensitivity to dynamic and static muscle stretch are long known, recent advances in molecular biology have allowed the characterization of the molecular mechanisms for signal transduction in muscle spindles. Building upon classic literature showing that a lack of sensory feedback is deleterious to locomotion, we bring to the discussion more recent findings that support a pivotal role of muscle spindles in maintaining murine and human locomotor robustness, defined as the ability to cope with perturbations. Yet, more research is needed to expand the existing mechanistic understanding of how muscle spindles contribute to the production of robust, functional locomotion in real world settings. Future investigations should focus on combining different animal models to identify, in health and disease, those peripheral, spinal and brain proprioceptive structures involved in the fine tuning of motor control when locomotion happens in challenging conditions.",

Data from the 2019 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 8474) were analyzed. Frequent muscle-building exercise in the past week (≥ 5 days and 7 days) were assessed. Multivariable logistic analyses were conducted separately by sex to obtain adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between key sociodemographic characteristics and muscle-building exercise. Nearly one in five (17.9%) boys, compared to 7.7% of girls, reported seven days of muscle-building exercise in the past week. Patterns of sociodemographic characteristics were associated with seven days of muscle-building exercise in the past week, including weight gain attempts among boys and Hispanic/Latina identity among girls. High engagement in muscle-building exercise is common among adolescents, particularly boys, and varied by sociodemographic characteristics, indicating a need for research to further describe engagement in muscle-building exercise among adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Morphogenesis requires building stable macromolecular structures from highly dynamic proteins. Muscles are anchored by long-lasting integrin adhesions to resist contractile force. However, the mechanisms governing integrin diffusion, immobilization, and activation within developing tissues remain elusive. Here, we show that actin polymerization-driven membrane protrusions form nanotopographies that enable strong adhesion at Drosophila muscle attachment sites (MASs). Super-resolution microscopy reveals that integrins assemble adhesive belts around Arp2/3-dependent actin protrusions, forming invadosome-like structures with membrane nanotopographies. Single protein tracking shows that, during MAS development, integrins become immobile and confined within diffusion traps formed by the membrane nanotopographies. Actin filaments also display restricted motion and confinement, indicating strong mechanical connection with integrins. Using isolated muscle cells, we show that substrate nanotopography, rather than rigidity, drives adhesion maturation by regulating actin protrusion, integrin diffusion and immobilization. These results thus demonstrate that actin-polymerization-driven membrane protrusions are essential for the formation of strong integrin adhesions sites in the developing embryo, and highlight the important contribution of geometry to morphogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Improving the delivery of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to skeletal and cardiac muscles remains a pivotal task toward the broader application of oligonucleotide therapeutics. The targeting of myofibers and cardiomyocytes via conjugation of ASOs and siRNAs to ligands that bind the human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) has gathered significant interest in recent years. However, the selection of ligands with low molecular weight and optimal biophysical and binding properties is crucial to maximize the potential of the TfR1 ligand-conjugated antisense (LICA) technology. Here, through effective combination of phage display and peptide medicinal chemistry, we identified and characterized a bicyclic peptide (Bicycle® molecule BCY17901), with a molecular weight of ∼2 kDa, that binds human TfR1 with high affinity and specificity. Conjugation to BCY17901 improved ASO and siRNA potency in skeletal and cardiac muscles of human TfR1 knock-in mice, after either intravenous or subcutaneous administration. Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA sequencing showed that conjugation to BCY17901 enhanced ASO activity in myonuclei of different muscle fiber types. Importantly, we demonstrated good translatability of our TfR1-targeting platform in skeletal and cardiac muscles of nonhuman primates. Our results offer great promise toward potential future applications of low-molecular-weight Bicycle LICA therapeutics for the treatment of diseases affecting skeletal muscle and heart.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity and team sports may be protective of substance use among adolescents, although there is mixed evidence on whether muscle-building exercise is associated with patterns of e-cigarette use (i.e., vaping), cigarette use, and cannabis use. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association between muscle-building exercise and patterns of concurrent substance use among U.S. adolescents. Cross-sectional data from the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 8,474) were analyzed in 2022. Muscle-building exercise was assessed by number of days of the behavior in the past week and categorized based on level of engagement (none, low, medium, and high). Concurrent vaping, cigarette use, and cannabis use within the past 30 days were assessed using a combined, four-category variable (no use, any single use, any dual use, and triple use). Multinomial logistic regressions, with coefficients transformed to relative risk ratios (RRR), were conducted to estimate the associations between muscle-building exercise and concurrent substance use among the overall sample, and by sex, while adjusting for relevant sociodemographic variables. Among the overall sample, high engagement (6-7 days) in muscle-building exercise was associated with greater relative risk of any single use (RRR 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.72), any dual use (RRR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10-2.94), and triple use (RRR 1.81, 95% CI 1.05-3.12). While muscle-building exercise was associated with greater relative risk of concurrent patterns of vaping, cigarette use, and cannabis use among adolescent males, there were no significant relationships found among adolescent females. Healthcare professionals should consider this association when treating adolescent males, particularly given the high prevalence of muscle-building exercise and substance use among this group. More research is needed to understand the experiences of adolescent males who report high engagement in muscle-building exercise and substance use to uncover mechanisms of association.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular system is constituted of multi-fibrillar muscles, tendons, motor neurons and associated muscle stem cells. Stereotyped pattern of muscle innervation and muscle-specific interactions with tendon cells suggest that neuromuscular system develops in a coordinated way. Remarkably, upon regeneration, coordinated assembly of all neuromuscular components is also critical to rebuild functional muscle. Thus, to ensure muscle function, the neuromuscular system components need to interact both during development and regeneration. Over the last decades, interactions between muscles and tendons, muscles and motor neurons and between muscles and muscle stem cells have been extensively analysed and documented. However, only recent evidence indicates that muscle stem cells interact with motor neurons and that these interactions contribute to building functional muscle both during development and regeneration. From this perspective, we discuss here the relationship between muscle stem cells and motor neurons during Drosophila neuromuscular system development and adverse impact of affected muscle stem cell-motor neuron interactions in regenerating vertebrate muscle.",

In order to support exercise, appropriate energy sources are essential: glucose can support both anaerobic and aerobic exercise, whereas fat can only be metabolized aerobically. Following exercise, ingestion of nonfiber carbohydrates and protein can aid muscle growth and recovery. Muscle glycogen replenishment is slow in horses, regardless of dietary interventions. Several heritable muscle disorders, including type 1 and 2 polysaccharide storage myopathy and recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis, can be managed in part by restricting dietary nonstructural carbohydrate intake.",

      "title": "Effects of wing damage and moult gaps on vertebrate flight performance.",
      "abstract": "Vertebrates capable of powered flight rely on wings, muscles that drive their flapping and sensory inputs to the brain allowing for control of the motor output. In birds, the wings are formed of arrangements of adjacent flight feathers (remiges), whereas the wings of bats consist of double-layered skin membrane stretched out between the forelimb skeleton, body and legs. Bird feathers become worn from use and brittle from UV exposure, which leads to loss of function; to compensate, they are renewed (moulted) at regular intervals. Bird feathers and the wings of bats can be damaged by accident. Wing damage and loss of wing surface due to moult almost invariably cause reduced flight performance in measures such as take-off angle and speed. During moult in birds, this is partially counteracted by concurrent mass loss and enlarged flight muscles. Bats have sensory hairs covering their wing surface that provide feedback information about flow; thus, wing damage affects flight speed and turning ability. Bats also have thin, thread-like muscles, distributed within the wing membrane and, if these are damaged, the control of wing camber is lost. Here, I review the effects of wing damage and moult on flight performance in birds, and the consequences of wing damage in bats. I also discuss studies of life-history trade-offs that make use of experimental trimming of flight feathers as a way to handicap parent birds feeding their young.",

      "abstract": "The study aimed to show the potential clinical application of supplements used among sportsmen for patients suffering from Intensive Care Unit-acquired Weakness (ICUAW) treatment. ICUAW is a common complication affecting approximately 40% of critically ill patients, often leading to long-term functional disability. ICUAW comprises critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, or a combination of both, such as critical illness polyneuromyopathy. Muscle degeneration begins shortly after the initiation of mechanical ventilation and persists post-ICU discharge until proteolysis and autophagy processes normalize. Several factors, including prolonged bedrest and muscle electrical silencing, contribute to muscle weakness, resulting from an imbalance between protein degradation and synthesis. ICUAW is associated with tissue hypoxia, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, reduced glucose uptake, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased free-radical production. Several well-studied dietary supplements and pharmaceuticals commonly used by athletes are proven to prevent the aforementioned mechanisms or aid in muscle building, regeneration, and maintenance. While there is no standardized treatment to prevent the occurrence of ICUAW, nutritional interventions have demonstrated the potential for its mitigation. The use of ergogenic substances, popular among muscle-building sociates, may offer potential benefits in preventing muscle loss and aiding recovery based on their work mechanisms.",

Moreover, fibroblasts can acquire an inflammatory phenotype to accommodate immune cells in specific niches and to provide migration, differentiation, and growth factors. In the heart, balancing of fibroblast activity is critical for cardiac homeostasis and optimal organ function during inflammation. Fibroblasts sustain cardiac homeostasis by generating local niche environments that support housekeeping functions and by actively engaging in intercellular cross talk. During inflammatory perturbations, cardiac fibroblasts rapidly switch to an inflammatory state and actively communicate with infiltrating immune cells to orchestrate immune cell migration and activity. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular landscape of cardiac fibroblasts, focusing on their dual role in promoting tissue homeostasis and modulating immune cell-cardiomyocyte interaction. In addition, we discuss potential future avenues for manipulating cardiac fibroblast activity during myocardial inflammation.",

      "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) VML is defined as the loss of a critical mass of skeletal muscle that overwhelms the muscle's natural healing mechanisms, leaving patients with permanent functional deficits and deformity. The treatment of these defects is complex, as skeletal muscle is a composite structure that relies closely on the action of supporting tissues such as tendons, vasculature, nerves, and bone. The gold standard of treatment for VML injuries, an autologous muscle flap transfer, suffers from many shortcomings but nevertheless remains the best clinically available avenue to restore function. This review will consider the use of composite tissue engineered constructs, with multiple components that act together to replicate the function of an intact muscle, as an alternative to autologous muscle flaps. We will discuss recent advances in the field of tissue engineering that enable skeletal muscle constructs to more closely reproduce the functionality of an autologous muscle flap by incorporating vasculature, promoting innervation, and reconstructing the muscle-tendon boundary. Additionally, our understanding of the cellular composition of skeletal muscle has evolved to recognize the importance of a diverse variety of cell types in muscle regeneration, including fibro/adipogenic progenitors and immune cells like macrophages and regulatory T cells. We will address recent advances in our understanding of how these cell types interact with, and can be incorporated into, implanted tissue engineered constructs.",

The aim of this work was to develop a set of muscle-driven simulations of cycling and to validate them by comparison with experimental data. We used direct collocation to generate simulations of 16 participants cycling over a range of powers (40-216 W) and cadences (75-99 RPM) using two optimization objectives: a baseline objective that minimized muscle effort and a second objective that additionally minimized tibiofemoral joint forces. We tested the accuracy of the simulations by comparing the timing of active muscle forces in our baseline simulation to timing in experimental electromyography data. Adding a term in the objective function to minimize tibiofemoral forces preserved cycling power and kinematics, improved similarity between active muscle force timing and experimental electromyography, and decreased tibiofemoral joint reaction forces, which better matched previously reported in vivo measurements. The musculoskeletal models, muscle-driven simulations, simulation software, and experimental data are freely shared at https://simtk.org/projects/cycling_sim for others to reproduce these results and build upon this research.",

Currently, the most well-known innovations include technologies such as high-intensity focused electromagnetic field (HIFEM™) and radiofrequency (RF), which, after more than 30 years of research, could be combined in the RF-SYNCHRODE™ (BTL Medizintechnik GmbH, Prague, Czech republic) without any health risks for the patient. This allows the reduction of adipose tissue and the building of muscle in a single treatment. The newer HIFES™ technology was developed specifically for the treatment of the facial area and facial muscles. It is used with synchronized radiofrequency for noninvasive, painless face lifting and skin tightening, and is also suitable for botulinum toxin patients. Visible, noticeable, and long-lasting treatment results are achieved without significant side effects after only 4-6 sessions. These noninvasive, FDA(Food and Drug Administration)- and CE-certified systems are used in everyday practice and clinical routine in dermatology, gynecology, urology, and physiotherapy and represent a real alternative to invasive aesthetic plastic surgery.",

      "abstract": "Development of obesity is primarily the result of imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Thyroid hormones influence energy expenditure by regulating cellular respiration and thermogenesis and by determining resting metabolic rate. Triiodothyronine influences lipid turnover in adipocytes and impacts appetite regulation through the central nervous system, mainly the hypothalamus. Thyroid-stimulating hormone may also influence thermogenesis, suppress appetite and regulate lipid storage through lipolysis and lipogenesis control. Subclinical hypothyroidism may induce changes in basal metabolic rate with subsequent increase in BMI, but obesity can also affect thyroid function via several mechanisms such as lipotoxicity and changes in adipokines and inflammatory cytokine secretion. The present study investigated the complex and mutual relationships between the thyroid axis and adiposity.",

      "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the effects of different rates of weight loss (WL), but equivalent total WL, on body composition and RMR. Studies examining gradual v. rapid WL on body composition and RMR in participants with overweight/obesity published up to October 2019 were identified through PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus and Ovid databases. Meta-analysis was carried out using a fixed or random effects model as appropriate. Although the magnitude of WL was similar (mean difference 0·03 kg, 95 % CI –0·65, 0·71), gradual WL promoted greater reductions in fat mass (FM) (–1 kg, 95 % CI –1·70, –0·29) and body fat percentage (BFP) (–0·83 %, 95 % CI –1·49, –0·17). Gradual WL significantly preserved RMR compared with rapid WL (407·48 kJ, 95 % CI 76·76, 118·01). However, there was no significant difference in waist and hip circumferences, waist:hip ratio and fat-free mass (FFM) between gradual and rapid WL. The present systematic review and meta-analysis indicates beneficial effects of gradual WL, as compared with rapid WL, on FM, BFP and RMR in individuals with overweight/obesity. However, FFM changes and anthropometric indices did not significantly differ following different rates of WL.",

      "abstract": "Deciphering how metabolic processes contribute to control of stem cell proliferation and differentiation is essential for understanding the mechanisms of regeneration. However, much is still unknown about axolotls' metabolism, which has not been studied in detail over their lifespan or under varied experimental conditions. We summarize the theoretical underpinnings of metabolism and respirometry, and describe a closed respirometry system to investigate metabolic energetics in axolotls as a specific aspect of metabolism. Placement of post-absorptive, fairly inactive animals in the multiple-probe respirometer for 24-48 h allows us to measure changes in concentrations of respiratory gases: oxygen (atmospheric and dissolved) and carbon dioxide, while monitoring the temperature and salinity (conductivity) of the chamber's water. Respirometry data are used to calculate oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output to estimate animal's metabolic energy dynamics during the observation periods. This method creates opportunities for study of potential fluctuations in axolotls' metabolic rate as it pertains to respiratory gases' dynamics during 24-h circadian cycle, as well as examination of changes in metabolic energy management during aging, under varied environmental temperatures, during post-amputation regeneration and many other circumstances.",

Here, we develop a method to compare metabolic rates as quotients of observed relative to expected values for mammals corrected for size, body composition, environmental temperature, and phylogenetic relatedness. Contrary to previous analyses, these quotients reveal that nonhuman primates have total metabolic rates expected for similar-sized mammals in similar environments. In addition, data from several small-scale societies show that humans evolved exceptionally high resting, activity, and total metabolic rates apparently by overcoming tradeoffs between resting and active energy expenditures that constrain other primates. Enhanced metabolic rates help humans fuel expanded brains, faster reproductive rates, extended longevity, and high percentage of body fat.",

      "abstract": "Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) commonly present with malnutrition attributed to various etiologies. One of the causes is potential hypermetabolism resulting from increased resting energy expenditure (REE). After the surgery, it is hypothesized that these patients show a reduction in REE, which may contribute to the weight gain observed in this population. However, there have been controversial results regarding the metabolic status of ESLD patients and liver recipients, which has led us to critically review the pertinent literature. We enrolled studies with the following goals: assessment of REE of these patients either before or after surgery by using indirect calorimetry (measured REE [mREE]) and comparison of these mREE values with those of healthy controls or with REE values obtained using predictive equations (predicted REE [pREE]). For most patients, mREE and pREE values were comparable. However, ≥5.3% of patients exhibited hypermetabolism when the mREE was compared with the pREE using the Harris-Benedict formula. Three follow-up studies that were conducted postsurgery showed a progressive reduction in the mREE for ≤1 year. However, conflicting data have been published, and cross-sectional studies have not reported hypometabolic patients. In conclusion, there is no consensus regarding the metabolic status of pre-LTx and post-LTx patients, which may be due to differences in the methods used for comparison. Therefore, we highlight this aspect of LTx patient management, which impacts the quality of nutrition therapy required by these patients.",

The energy expenditure (EE) can be categorized into various obligatory and facultative processes. In sedentary adults, basal metabolic rate is the largest contributor to total daily EE, and interindividual variability can be significant. Additional EE is required for digesting and metabolizing food, thermoregulatory adaptation to cold, and to support exercise and nonexercise body movements. Interindividual variability also exists for these EE processes, even after controlling for known factors. The complex mechanisms of interindividual variability in EE can have genetic and environmental origins and require further investigation. Exploration of interindividual variability in EE and its underlying factors holds importance to metabolic health, as it may predict disease risk, and be useful in the personalization of preventative and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Systemic glucocorticoid excess causes several adverse metabolic conditions, most notably Cushing's syndrome. These effects are amplified by the intracellular enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1). Here, we determined the less well-characterised effects of glucocorticoid excess, and the contribution of 11β-HSD1 amplification on metabolic rate in mice. Male and female C57BL/6J (wild type, WT) and 11β-HSD1 knockout (11β-HSD1 KO) mice were treated with high-dose corticosterone or a vehicle control for 3 weeks. Indirect calorimetry was conducted during the final week of treatment, with or without fasting, to determine the impact on metabolic rate. We found that corticosterone treatment elevated metabolic rate and promoted carbohydrate utilisation primarily in female WT mice, with effects more pronounced during the light phase. Corticosterone treatment also resulted in greater fat accumulation in female WT mice. Corticosterone induced hyperphagia was identified as a likely causal factor altering the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) but not energy expenditure (EE). Male and female 11β-HSD1 KO mice were protected against these effects. We identify novel metabolic consequences of sustained glucocorticoid excess, identify a key mechanism of hyperphagia, and demonstrate that 11β-HSD1 is required to manifest the full metabolic derangement.",

      "abstract": "An animal's body size impacts many aspects of its structure and function (Y); insights that only become apparent when viewed over several orders of magnitude of body mass (M) and expressed allometrically in the form of power law equations (Y=aMb). The resulting relationships are apparent clusters of similar exponents (b) revealing emergent 'patterns of design' that shed light on the universal principles of structure and function. Basic physical principles of surface area, volume and heat exchange apply to all objects, including animals, and many consequences must be attributed to these fundamental properties. Starting with Galileo's description of the shapes of bones in the 16th century and extending to 19th century explanations of heat production and loss by Sarrus and Rameaux, allometric patterns have provided numerous biological insights. Here, we examine several of these insights and explore how the selective pressures and scaling may differ when comparing animals in a vegetative (basal) state and those utilizing their maximum metabolic capacities. It seems that the selective pressures under those two conditions differ. We caution that allometric patterns invite explanations that lack supporting data or may be dismissed because there is hesitation among biologists to make comparisons lacking phylogenetic support. We argue that emergent allometric patterns have inherent value and continue to be the fodder for many fruitful hypotheses.",

      "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has continued to rise, and obesity and its attendant metabolic disorders are major global health threat factors. Among the current interventions for obesity, none have demonstrated sustained efficacy in achieving long-term outcomes. So, the identification of therapeutic targets is of paramount importance in the advancement and sustainability of obesity. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) constitutes 60%-75% of total energy expenditure and serves a crucial function in maintaining energy balance. Nevertheless, there exists considerable heterogeneity in RMR among individuals. Low RMR is associated with weight gain, elevating the susceptibility to obesity-related ailments. Hence, RMR will be the main focus of interest in the study of obesity treatment. In this review, we will elucidate the influence factors and mechanisms of action of RMR in obesity, with particular emphasis on the effects of obesity treatment on RMR and the alterations and influence factors of RMR in special types of populations with obesity.",

HNF4α plays a key role in lipid and glucose metabolism and intersects with not just diabetes and circadian rhythms but also with liver cancer, although much remains to be elucidated about those interactions. Similarly, while we are beginning to elucidate the role of the isoforms expressed from its two promoters, we know little about the alternatively spliced variants in other portions of the protein and their impact on the 1000-plus HNF4α target genes. This review will address how HNF4α came to be called the master regulator of liver-specific gene expression with a focus on its role in basic metabolism, the contributions of the various isoforms and the intriguing intersection with the circadian clock.",

      "abstract": "The presence of insoluble aggregates of amyloid β (Aβ) in the form of neuritic plaques (NPs) is one of the main features that define Alzheimer's disease. Studies have suggested that the accumulation of these peptides in the brain significantly contributes to extensive neuronal loss. Furthermore, the content and distribution of cholesterol in the membrane have been shown to have an important effect on the production and subsequent accumulation of Aβ peptides in the plasma membrane, contributing to dysfunction and neuronal death. The monomeric forms of these membrane-bound peptides undergo several conformational changes, ranging from oligomeric forms to beta-sheet structures, each presenting different levels of toxicity. Aβ peptides can be internalized by particular receptors and trigger changes from Tau phosphorylation to alterations in cognitive function, through dysfunction of the cholinergic system. The goal of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the role of lipids in Alzheimer's disease and their relationship with the basal cholinergic system, as well as potential disease-modifying therapies.",

A central question for nutritional sciences is how much energy is required to sustain cellular work while maintaining an adequate body mass. Because human energy balance is not exempt from thermodynamic principles, the energy requirement can be approached from the energy expenditure. Conceptual and technological advances have allowed understanding of the physiological determinants of energy expenditure. Body mass, sex, and age are the main factors determining energy expenditure. These factors constitute the basis for predictive equations for resting (REE) and total (TEE) energy expenditure in healthy adults. These equations yield predictions that differ up to ~400 kcal/d for REE and ~550 kcal/d for TEE. Identifying additional factors accounting for such variability and the most valid equations appears relevant. This review used novel approaches based on mathematical modeling of REE and analyses of the data from which REE predictive equations were generated. As for TEE, R",

      "abstract": "The use of energy is universal to all life forms and all levels of biological organization, potentially linking processes operating at variable scales. Individual and species ranges might be energetically constrained, yet divergent metabolic limitations at both scales can disassociate these individual and species traits. We analysed comparative energetic and range data to unravel the mechanistic basis of the dissociation between individual and species range sizes observed among mammalian species. Our results demonstrate that basal, or maintenance, metabolism negatively correlates with individual ranges, but, at the same time, it positively correlates with species ranges. High aerobic capacity, i.e. maximum metabolic rate, positively correlates with individual ranges, but it is weakly related to species range size. These antagonistic energetic constraints on both ranges could lead to a disassociation between individual and species traits and to a low covariation between home and species range sizes. We show that important organismal functions, such as basal and maximum metabolic rates, have the potential to unravel mechanisms operating at different levels of biological organization and to expose links between energy-dependent processes at different scales.",

      "abstract": "Studying factors that contribute to our understanding of maintaining normal energy balance are of paramount significance following spinal cord injury (SCI). Accurate determination of energy needs is crucial for providing nutritional guidance and managing the increasing prevalence of malnutrition or obesity after SCI. BMR represents 75-80 % of the total energy expenditure in persons with SCI. Accurately measuring BMR is an important component for calculating total energetic needs in this population. Indirect calorimetry is considered the gold-standard technique for measuring BMR. However, technical challenges may limit its applications in large cohort studies and alternatively rely on prediction equations. Previous work has shown that BMR changes in response to disuse and exercise in the range of 15-120 %. Factors including sex, level of injury and type of assistive devices may influence BMR after SCI. RMR is erroneously used interchangeably for BMR, which may result in overestimation of energetic intake when developing nutritional plans. To address this concern, we comprehensively reviewed studies that conducted BMR (",

      "abstract": "All life acquires energy through metabolic processes and that energy is subsequently allocated to life-sustaining functions such as survival, growth and reproduction. Thus, it has long been assumed that metabolic rate is related to the life history of an organism. Indeed, metabolic rate is commonly believed to set the pace of life by determining where an organism is situated along a fast-slow life-history continuum. However, empirical evidence of a direct interspecific relationship between metabolic rate and life histories is lacking, especially for ectothermic organisms. Here, we ask whether three life-history traits-maximum body mass, generation length and growth performance-explain variation in resting metabolic rate (RMR) across fishes. We found that growth performance, which accounts for the trade-off between growth rate and maximum body size, explained variation in RMR, yet maximum body mass and generation length did not. Our results suggest that measures of life history that encompass trade-offs between life-history traits, rather than traits in isolation, explain variation in RMR across fishes. Ultimately, understanding the relationship between metabolic rate and life history is crucial to metabolic ecology and has the potential to improve prediction of the ecological risk of data-poor species.",

      "abstract": "The energy demands of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) vary depending on pancreatic function, body composition, lung function, and clinical status. In clinical practice, predictive equations are used to determine energy requirements yet do not reliably account for these factors. Research regarding energy requirements during CF pulmonary exacerbation (CFPEx) and clinical stability is conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate potential within-individual changes in measured resting energy expenditure (mREE) using indirect calorimetry (IC) at the commencement and completion of intravenous antibiotic treatment (IVABx) for CFPEx and during clinical stability. Secondary aims were to investigate potential differences between predicted resting energy expenditure (pREE) using Schofield equation and correlations between clinical factors with mREE.",

Basal heat production, now usually referred to as resting energy expenditure (REE), is currently recognized as deriving from biochemical reactions at subcellular and cellular levels that are expressed in the energy expended by the body's 78 organs and tissues. These organs and tissues, and the 11 systems to which they belong, influence body size and shape. Connecting these subcellular-/cellular-level reactions to organs and tissues, and then on to body size and shape, provides a comprehensive understanding of individual differences in REE, a contemporary topic of interest in obesity research and clinical practice. This review critically examines these linkages, their association with widely used statistical and physiological REE prediction formulas, and often-unappreciated aspects of measuring basal heat production in humans.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of endothermy in vertebrates is a major research topic in recent decades that has been tackled by a myriad of research disciplines including paleontology, anatomy, physiology, evolutionary and developmental biology. The ability of most mammals to maintain a relatively constant and high body temperature is considered a key adaptation, enabling them to successfully colonize new habitats and harsh environments. It has been proposed that in mammals the anterior nasal cavity, which houses the maxilloturbinal, plays a pivotal role in body temperature maintenance, via a bony system supporting an epithelium involved in heat and moisture conservation. The presence and the relative size of the maxilloturbinal has been proposed to reflect the endothermic conditions and basal metabolic rate in extinct vertebrates. We show that there is no evidence to relate the origin of endothermy and the development of some turbinal bones by using a comprehensive dataset of µCT-derived maxilloturbinals spanning most mammalian orders. Indeed, we demonstrate that neither corrected basal metabolic rate nor body temperature significantly correlate with the relative surface area of the maxilloturbinal. Instead, we identify important variations in the relative surface area, morpho-anatomy, and complexity of the maxilloturbinal across the mammalian phylogeny and species ecology.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric and metabolic disorders are highly comorbid and the relationship between these disorders is bidirectional. The mechanisms underlying the association between psychiatric and metabolic disorders are presently unclear, which warrants investigation into the dynamics of the interplay between metabolism, substrate utilization, and energy expenditure in psychiatric populations, and how these constructs compare to those in healthy controls. Indirect calorimetry (IC) methods are a reliable, minimally invasive means for assessing metabolic rate and substrate utilization in humans. This review synthesizes the extant literature on the use of IC on resting metabolism in psychiatric populations to investigate the interaction between psychiatric and metabolic functioning. Consistently, resting energy expenditures and/or substrate utilization values were significantly different between psychiatric and healthy populations in the studies contained in this review. Furthermore, resting energy expenditure values were systematically overestimated when derived from predictive equations, compared to when measured by IC, in psychiatric populations. High heterogeneity between study populations (e.g., differing diagnoses and drug regimens) and methodologies (e.g., differing posture, time of day, and fasting status at measurement) impeded the synthesis of results. Standardized IC protocols would benefit this line of research by enabling meta-analyses, revealing trends within and between different psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "Resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a significant contributor to an individual's total energy expenditure. As such, RMR plays an important role in body weight regulation across populations ranging from inactive individuals to athletes. In addition, RMR may also be used to screen for low energy availability and energy deficiency in athletes, and thus may be useful in identifying individuals at risk for the deleterious consequences of chronic energy deficiency. Given its importance in both clinical and research settings within the fields of exercise physiology, dietetics, and sports medicine, the valid assessment of RMR is critical. However, factors including varying states of energy balance (both short- and long-term energy deficit or surplus), energy availability, and prior food intake or exercise may influence resulting RMR measures, potentially introducing error into observed values. The purpose of this review is to summarize the relationships between short- and long-term changes in energetic status and resulting RMR measures, consider these findings in the context of relevant recommendations for RMR assessment, and provide suggestions for future research.",

      "abstract": "It is intuitive to expect a relationship between animal personality (i.e. consistent individual behavioural differences) and metabolic rate, but the literature contains mixed results. Most studies have measured resting metabolic rate (RMR); yet, other metrics such as V̇O2,max and metabolic scope may also relate to personality. Here, we explored the relationships between personality (docility and exploration) and three metabolic traits (RMR, V̇O2,max and metabolic scope) in wild mice (Peromyscus leucopus). We found no among-individual correlation (rind) between personality and motivation to run during V̇O2,max trials, suggesting that using our standard forced-exercise test did not introduce a personality-related sampling bias. At the within-individual level, we found a positive and significant relationship between docility and metabolic scope, and the correlation was entirely driven by V̇O2,max. Finally, we found a positive and significant rind between RMR and time spent grooming during the open-field test, which may be caused by the stress response.",

      "abstract": "Given the ongoing strain that the obesity epidemic has placed on public health outcomes, new and effective approaches to weight control are needed. One approach to improving weight and metabolic outcomes is intermittent fasting, which consists of multiple different timing schedules for temporary food avoidance, including alternate-day fasting, other similar full-day fasting patterns, and time-restricted feeding (where the day's food is consumed over a 6-h period, allowing for 18 h of fasting). These feeding schedules have favorable metabolic effects by intermittently inducing the metabolism of fatty acids to ketones. The regimens overall lead to a decrease in weight and have been linked to improvements in dyslipidemia and blood pressure. While more research is needed on longer-term outcomes and this approach should be avoided in particular health conditions, intermittent fasting should be considered as an option for individuals who have a pattern of unhealthy weight gain using standard eating patterns.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained increasing scientific and general attention. Most studied forms of IF include alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating (TRE). Several cardiometabolic effects of IF have been described in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans. This review analyzes the impact of IF on weight loss, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and lipid profile in humans. A literature search was conducted in the Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Controlled observational or interventional studies in humans, published between January 2000 and June 2021, were included. Studies comparing IF versus religious fasting were not included. Most studies indicate that the different types of IF have significant benefits on body composition, inducing weight loss and reducing fat mass. Changes in cardiometabolic parameters show more divergent results. In general, a decrease in fasting glucose and insulin levels is observed, together with an improved lipid profile associated with cardiovascular risk. High heterogeneity in study designs was observed, particularly in studies with TRE, small sample sizes, and short-term interventions. Current evidence shows that IF confers a range of cardiometabolic benefits in humans. Weight loss, improvement of glucose homeostasis and lipid profile, are observed in the three types of IF protocols evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) modifies cell- and tissue-specific immunometabolic responses that dictate metabolic flexibility and inflammation during obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Fasting forces periods of metabolic flexibility and necessitates increased use of different substrates. IF can lower metabolic inflammation and improve glucose metabolism without lowering obesity and can influence time-dependent, compartmentalized changes in immunity. Liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and immune cells communicate to relay metabolic and immune signals during fasting. Here we review the connections between metabolic and immune cells to explain the divergent effects of IF compared with classic caloric restriction (CR) strategies. We also explore how the immunometabolism of metabolic diseases dictates certain IF outcomes, where the gut microbiota triggers changes in immunity and metabolism during fasting.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting has gained global popularity for its potential health benefits, although its impact on somatic stem cells and tissue biology remains elusive. Here, we report that commonly used intermittent fasting regimens inhibit hair follicle regeneration by selectively inducing apoptosis in activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). This effect is independent of calorie reduction, circadian rhythm alterations, or the mTORC1 cellular nutrient-sensing mechanism. Instead, fasting activates crosstalk between adrenal glands and dermal adipocytes in the skin, triggering the rapid release of free fatty acids into the niche, which in turn disrupts the normal metabolism of HFSCs and elevates their cellular reactive oxygen species levels, causing oxidative damage and apoptosis. A randomized clinical trial (NCT05800730) indicates that intermittent fasting inhibits human hair growth. Our study uncovers an inhibitory effect of intermittent fasting on tissue regeneration and identifies interorgan communication that eliminates activated HFSCs and halts tissue regeneration during periods of unstable nutrient supply.",

Background: There is evidence, obtained both with animal model systems and with humans, that intermittent fasting has health benefits. These benefits include extended longevity, weight loss, and counteracting various disease conditions. Such procedures positively influence the benefits of human tissue-specific microbiomes and minimize the consequences of organellar apoptosis. Key Messages: In this review, we attempt to summarize the predominant evidence, published in the scientific literature, relevant to the conclusions that in general, and in many specific instances, intermittent fasting has long-term benefits to animals, including humans, with respect to overall and specific organismal health and longevity.",

      "abstract": "The role and molecular mechanisms of intermittent fasting (IF) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its transition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. Here, we identified that an IF 5:2 regimen prevents NASH development as well as ameliorates established NASH and fibrosis without affecting total calorie intake. Furthermore, the IF 5:2 regimen blunted NASH-HCC transition when applied therapeutically. The timing, length, and number of fasting cycles as well as the type of NASH diet were critical parameters determining the benefits of fasting. Combined proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses identified that peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and glucocorticoid-signaling-induced PCK1 act co-operatively as hepatic executors of the fasting response. In line with this, PPARα targets and PCK1 were reduced in human NASH. Notably, only fasting initiated during the active phase of mice robustly induced glucocorticoid signaling and free-fatty-acid-induced PPARα signaling. However, hepatocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion only partially abrogated the hepatic fasting response. In contrast, the combined knockdown of Ppara and Pck1 in vivo abolished the beneficial outcomes of fasting against inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, overexpression of Pck1 alone or together with Ppara in vivo lowered hepatic triglycerides and steatosis. Our data support the notion that the IF 5:2 regimen is a promising intervention against NASH and subsequent liver cancer.",

      "abstract": "This review aims to summarize the effects of intermittent fasting on markers of cardiometabolic health in humans. All forms of fasting reviewed here-alternate-day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating (TRE)-produced mild to moderate weight loss (1-8% from baseline) and consistent reductions in energy intake (10-30% from baseline). These regimens may benefit cardiometabolic health by decreasing blood pressure, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels are also lowered, but findings are variable. Other health benefits, such as improved appetite regulation and favorable changes in the diversity of the gut microbiome, have also been demonstrated, but evidence for these effects is limited. Intermittent fasting is generally safe and does not result in energy level disturbances or increased disordered eating behaviors. In summary, intermittent fasting is a safe diet therapy that can produce clinically significant weight loss (>5%) and improve several markers of metabolic health in individuals with obesity.",

      "title": "Effect of Intermittent Fasting on Reproductive Hormone Levels in Females and Males: A Review of Human Trials.",
      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is a popular diet for weight loss, but concerns have been raised regarding the effects of fasting on the reproductive health of women and men. Accordingly, we conducted this literature review to clarify the effects of fasting on reproductive hormone levels in humans. Our results suggest that intermittent fasting decreases androgen markers (i.e., testosterone and the free androgen index (FAI)) while increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in premenopausal females with obesity. This effect was more likely to occur when food consumption was confined to earlier in the day (eating all food before 4 pm). In contrast, fasting did not have any effect on estrogen, gonadotropins, or prolactin levels in women. As for men, intermittent fasting reduced testosterone levels in lean, physically active, young males, but it did not affect SHBG concentrations. Interestingly, muscle mass and muscular strength were not negatively affected by these reductions in testosterone. In interpreting these findings, it is important to note that very few studies have been conducted on this topic. Thus, it is difficult to draw solid conclusions at present. From the limited data presented here, it is possible that intermittent fasting may decrease androgen markers in both genders. If this is the case, these results would have varied health implications. On the one hand, fasting may prove to be a valuable tool for treating hyperandrogenism in females with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by improving menstruation and fertility. On the other hand, fasting may be shown to decrease androgens among males, which could negatively affect metabolic health and libido. More research is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.",

      "title": "The Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Brain and Cognitive Function.",
      "abstract": "The importance of diet and the gut-brain axis for brain health and cognitive function is increasingly acknowledged. Dietary interventions are tested for their potential to prevent and/or treat brain disorders. Intermittent fasting (IF), the abstinence or strong limitation of calories for 12 to 48 h, alternated with periods of regular food intake, has shown promising results on neurobiological health in animal models. In this review article, we discuss the potential benefits of IF on cognitive function and the possible effects on the prevention and progress of brain-related disorders in animals and humans. We do so by summarizing the effects of IF which through metabolic, cellular, and circadian mechanisms lead to anatomical and functional changes in the brain. Our review shows that there is no clear evidence of a positive short-term effect of IF on cognition in healthy subjects. Clinical studies show benefits of IF for epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis on disease symptoms and progress. Findings from animal studies show mechanisms by which Parkinson's disease, ischemic stroke, autism spectrum disorder, and mood and anxiety disorders could benefit from IF. Future research should disentangle whether positive effects of IF hold true regardless of age or the presence of obesity. Moreover, variations in fasting patterns, total caloric intake, and intake of specific nutrients may be relevant components of IF success. Longitudinal studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) will provide a window into the long-term effects of IF on the development and progress of brain-related diseases.",

      "abstract": "The global human population has recently experienced an increase in life expectancy with a mounting concern about the steady rise in the incidence of age-associated chronic diseases and socio-economic burden. Calorie restriction (CR), the reduction of energy intake without malnutrition, is a dietary manipulation that can increase health and longevity in most model organisms. However, the practice of CR in day-to-day life is a challenging long-term goal for human intervention. Recently, daily fasting length and periodicity have emerged as potential drivers behind CR's beneficial health effects. Numerous strategies and eating patterns have been successfully developed to recapitulate many of CR's benefits without its austerity. These novel feeding protocols range from shortened meal timing designed to interact with our circadian system (e.g., daily time-restricted feeding) to more extended fasting regimens known as intermittent fasting. Here, we provide a glimpse of the current status of knowledge on different strategies to reap the benefits of CR on metabolic health in murine models and in humans, without the rigor of continuous reduction in caloric intake as presented at the USU State of the Science Symposium.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern in which individuals go extended periods with little or no energy intake after consuming regular food in intervening periods. IF has several health-promoting effects. It can effectively reduce weight, fasting insulin levels, and blood glucose levels. It can also increase the antitumor activity of medicines and cause improvement in the case of neurological diseases, such as memory deficit, to achieve enhanced metabolic function and prolonged longevity. Additionally, IF activates several biological pathways to induce autophagy, encourages cell renewal, prevents cancer cells from multiplying and spreading, and delays senescence. However, IF has specific adverse effects and limitations when it comes to people of a particular age and gender. Hence, a more systematic study on the health-promoting effects and safety of IF is needed. This article reviewed the research on the health-promoting effects of IF, providing a theoretical basis, direction for subsequent basic research, and information related to the clinical application of IF.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular types of diet at the moment because it is an effective nutritional strategy in terms of weight loss. The main objective of this review is to analyze the effects that intermittent fasting has on sports performance. We analyzed physical capacities: aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, strength, and power, as well as their effect on body composition. For this, a bibliographic search was carried out in several databases where 25 research articles were analyzed to clarify these objectives. Inclusion criteria: dates between 2013 and present, free full texts, studies conducted in adult human athletes, English and/or Spanish languages, and if it has been considered that intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in terms of performance or physical capacities. This review was registered in PROSPERO with code ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias was performed. After this analysis, results were obtained regarding the improvement of body composition and the maintenance of muscle mass. An influence of intermittent fasting on sports performance and body composition is observed. It can be concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power. But despite this, it is necessary to carry out new studies focusing on the sports field since the samples have been very varied. Additionally, the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied, especially in the case of overnight fasting.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting, which includes periods of fasting and nutrition, has been considered a dietary approach for weight loss and metabolic health improvement. However, its potential benefits in autoimmune diseases have not been widely studied. This study aims to review the existing studies on the role and effects of intermittent fasting on autoimmune diseases. A comprehensive search was conducted on electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, and relevant studies were included based on inclusion criteria. Studies show that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, by reducing inflammatory markers, modulating the immune system, altering and improving gut microbiota, and enhancing cellular repair mechanisms through autophagy. However, evidence regarding the effects of intermittent fasting on other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid diseases, and psoriasis is limited and inconclusive. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine optimal intermittent fasting guidelines and its long-term effects on autoimmune diseases. Overall, this literature review proves intermittent fasting may be a promising dietary intervention for managing autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Previously, narrative reviews have considered the effects of intermittent fasting on appetite. One suggestion is that intermittent fasting attenuates an increase in appetite that typically accompanies weight loss. Here, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of intermittent fasting on appetite, when compared to a continuous energy restriction intervention. Five electronic databases and trial registers were searched in February 2021 and February 2022. Abstracts (N = 2800) were screened and 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), consisting of a variety of intermittent fasting regimes, met our inclusion criteria. The total number of participants allocated to interventions was 1111 and all RCTs were judged as having either some concerns or a high risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on change-from-baseline appetite ratings. There was no clear evidence that intermittent fasting affected hunger (WMD = -3.03; 95% CI [-8.13, 2.08]; ",

      "abstract": "Diet may promote brain health in metabolically impaired older individuals. In an 8-week randomized clinical trial involving 40 cognitively intact older adults with insulin resistance, we examined the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet on brain health. Although intermittent fasting induced greater weight loss, the two diets had comparable effects in improving insulin signaling biomarkers in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, decreasing the brain-age-gap estimate (reflecting the pace of biological aging of the brain) on magnetic resonance imaging, reducing brain glucose on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and improving blood biomarkers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with minimal changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Intermittent fasting and healthy living improved executive function and memory, with intermittent fasting benefiting more certain cognitive measures. In exploratory analyses, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E and SLC16A7 genotypes modulated diet effects. The study provides a blueprint for assessing brain effects of dietary interventions and motivates further research on intermittent fasting and continuous diets for brain health optimization.

A bibliographic review of the literature on intermittent fasting and obesity, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis was carried out. The scientific quality of the methodology and the results obtained were evaluated in pairs. Intermittent fasting has beneficial effects on the lipid profile, and it is associated with weight loss and a modification of the distribution of abdominal fat in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes as well as an improvement in the control of glycemic levels. In patients with multiple sclerosis, the data available are too scarce to draw any firm conclusions, but it does appear that intermittent fasting may be a safe and feasible intervention. However, it is necessary to continue investigating its long-term effects since so far, the studies carried out are small and of short duration.",

      "abstract": "Almost 40% of the adult population in the USA will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Diet is a modifiable factor which is known to affect cancer risk and recurrence. Yet, little is known about how diet influences cancer treatment outcomes. Intermittent fasting, characterized by periods of abstaining from foods and beverages alternated with periods of ad libitum intake, when adopted in the context of chemotherapy, has shown promise in preclinical models resulting in decreased vomiting, diarrhea, visible discomfort, and improved insulin sensitivity and efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment. Although intermittent fasting during receipt of chemotherapy has been well-established in preclinical models, limited numbers of human studies are now being reported. This review aims to survey the current data examining the effect of intermittent fasting on chemotherapy efficacy, patient treatment outcomes, patient centered outcomes, and circulating biomarkers associated with cancer. Available data show that periodic fasting, a form of intermittent fasting, may hold potential to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy, decrease treatment-related side effects and cancer-promoting factors such as insulin, while ameliorating treatment-related decreases in quality of life and daily functioning. Larger controlled periodic fasting trials, including exploration of alternate forms of intermittent fasting, are needed to better elucidate the effect of intermittent fasting on treatment and patient outcomes during chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF) and its numerous modifications have been increasingly suggested as a promising therapy for age-related problems and a non-pharmacological strategy to extend lifespan. Despite the great variability in feeding schedules that we describe in the current work, underlying physiological processes are the same and include a periodic switch from glucose metabolism (generated by glycogenolysis) to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones. Many of the beneficial effects of IF appear to be mediated by optimization of energy utilization. Findings to date from both human and animal experiments indicate that fasting improves physiological function, enhances performance, and slows aging and disease processes. In this review, we discuss some of the remarkable discoveries about the beneficial effects of IF on metabolism, endocrine and cardiovascular systems, cancer prevention, brain health, neurodegeneration and aging. Experimental studies on rodent models and human investigations are summarized to compare the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of IF. Metabolic and cellular responses triggered by IF could help to achieve the aim of preventing disease, and maximizing healthspan and longevity with minimal side effects.",

      "abstract": "Obesity often results in severe negative health consequences and represents a growing issue for global health. Reducing food intake is a crucial factor for weight loss. Intermittent fasting is a relatively new intervention that contributes to weight reduction. Considering the intimate relationship between obesity and inflammatory pathologies with gut microbiota alterations, a systematic review of the literature was herein conducted to elucidate the relationship between time-restricted food intake and gut microbiota diversity in humans. Searches are carried out in three databases (PubMed, MedLine/OVID, and Academic Search Complete) between April 2019 and April 2022. Nine studies (all with longitudinal design) were identified as eligible by presenting data about the impact of intermittent fasting schemes on gut microbiota. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increase throughout follow-ups, while 16 bacteria genera change their abundance in response to intermittent fasting. Finally, some genera associated with clinical predictors such as weight change, abdominal circumference, and metabolic variables were reported. Changes induced by fasting schemes positively impact the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota and the biomarkers described here. However, the changes previously reported have been studied in short periods and some return to their basal state after fasting intervention.",

      "abstract": "Population aging and the associated increase in cardiovascular disease rates pose serious threats to global public health. Different forms of fasting have become an increasingly attractive strategy to directly address aging and potentially limit or delay the onset of cardiovascular diseases. A growing number of experimental studies and clinical trials indicate that the amount and timing of food intake as well as the daily time window during which food is consumed, are crucial determinants of cardiovascular health. Indeed, intermittent fasting counteracts the molecular hallmarks of cardiovascular aging and promotes different aspects of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure and glycemic control, as well as body weight reduction. In this report, we summarize current evidence from randomized clinical trials of intermittent fasting on body weight and composition as well as cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Moreover, we critically discuss the preventive and therapeutic potential of intermittent fasting, but also possible detrimental effects in the context of cardiovascular aging and related disease. We delve into the physiological mechanisms through which intermittent fasting might improve cardiovascular health, and raise important factors to consider in the design of clinical trials on the efficacy of intermittent fasting to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events among aged individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. We conclude that despite growing evidence and interest among the lay and scientific communities in the cardiovascular health-improving effects of intermittent fasting, further research efforts and appropriate caution are warranted before broadly implementing intermittent fasting regimens, especially in elderly persons.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a significant public health concern globally. Weight managementis crucial in controlling MetS risk factors, making energy balance and weight loss strategies important in nutrition recommendations. Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained traction as a dietary approach for weight management and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, the effects of IF on cardiovascular risk factors have been inconsistent in previous studies. This review aims to summarize the effects of various types of IF on body mass index (BMI), glycemia, lipid profile, and blood pressure, while providing insights into their clinical implications. A comprehensive search of interventional studies and meta-analyses was conducted, and the results were analyzed. The findings indicate that different types of IF lead to mixed effects. Time-restricted eating (TRE) and alternate-day fasting (ADF) consistently showed decreases in BMI, while the outcomes of intermittent energy restriction (IER) were more uncertain. The effects of IF on glycemia and lipid profile were also variable, with TRE and ADF generally showing positive results. However, the impact of IER remained inconsistent. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects and optimal implementation of IF for managing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is a dietary pattern characterized by alternating periods of total or partial fasting and ad libitum food consumption. During prolonged fasting, the body uses the ketone bodies formed from lipolysis of body fat, which also leads to some metabolic modifications with positive effects on health. In this sense, nocturnal intermittent fasting could contribute to properly synchronize the circadian system making the physiological, hormonal, energetic and metabolic processes work correctly and keeping to the individual in homeostasis. Thus, according to the results of different studies, intermittent fasting, in the short-medium term, seems to improve body composition, as well as the values of several cardiometabolic parameters such as insulin and HOMA-IR index, among others. These effects have been observed in both pre- and postmenopausal women (no differences have been found between both states) and are similar to those found in interventions with caloric restriction diets.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most-frequent malignancy amongst women, whereas obesity and excess caloric consumption increase the risk for developing the disease. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) on previously diagnosed BC patients, regarding quality of life (QoL) scores during chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced toxicity, radiological response and BC recurrence, endocrine-related outcomes, as well as IF-induced adverse effects in these populations. A comprehensive search was conducted between 31 December 2010 and 31 October 2022, using the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Two investigators independently performed abstract screenings, full-text screenings, and data extraction, and the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. We screened 468 papers, 10 of which were selected for data synthesis. All patients were female adults whose age ranged between 27 and 78 years. Participants in all studies were women diagnosed with BC of one of the following stages: I, II (HER2-/+), III (HER2-/+), IV, LUMINAL-A, LUMINAL-B (HER2-/+). Notably, IF during chemotherapy was found to be feasible, safe and able to relieve chemotherapy-induced adverse effects and cytotoxicity. IF seemed to improve QoL during chemotherapy, through the reduction of fatigue, nausea and headaches, however data were characterized as low quality. IF was found to reduce chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and augmented optimal glycemic regulation, improving serum glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 concentrations. A remarkable heterogeneity of duration of dietary patterns was observed among available studies. In conclusion, we failed to identify any IF-related beneficial effects on the QoL, response after chemotherapy or related symptoms, as well as measures of tumor recurrence in BC patients. We identified a potential beneficial effect of IF on chemotherapy-induced toxicity, based on markers of DNA and leukocyte damage; however, these results were derived from three studies and require further validation. Further studies with appropriate design and larger sample sizes are warranted to elucidate its potential standard incorporation in daily clinical practice.",

In both animals and humans, TRF has pleiotropic health benefits that arise from multiple organ systems, yet the molecular basis of TRF-mediated benefits is not well understood. Here, we subjected mice to isocaloric ad libitum feeding (ALF) or TRF of a western diet and examined gene expression changes in samples taken from 22 organs and brain regions collected every 2 h over a 24-h period. We discovered that TRF profoundly impacts gene expression. Nearly 80% of all genes show differential expression or rhythmicity under TRF in at least one tissue. Functional annotation of these changes revealed tissue- and pathway-specific impacts of TRF. These findings and resources provide a critical foundation for future mechanistic studies and will help to guide human time-restricted eating (TRE) interventions to treat various disease conditions with or without pharmacotherapies.",

      "title": "Role of Intermittent Fasting in the Management of Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.",
      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent disease in the modern society. It can be defined as a group of metabolic diseases marked by chronic hyperglycemia arising from defects in insulin secretion or resistance to insulin action, or both. Its predecessor, prediabetes, is also an important entity, and its management is essential to prevent its progression to DM. Together, these entities burden global health and the world economy, and therefore, prevention and management are key to improving global health and reducing the financial burden on the world economy. Comprehensive lifestyle modification has been proven to be a safe and effective method for preventing the progression of prediabetes and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lifestyle modifications such as weight loss, exercise, and diets such as low-carbohydrate one, Mediterranean, and very low calorie diets are traditionally recommended. These particular diets aim to attain calorie deficits and thus induce weight loss. Intermittent fasting (IF) is one such diet that focuses more on the timing of calorie consumption. However, there are several methods of achieving this, which are highlighted in this review. IF has been shown to promote weight loss, reduce insulin resistance, improve glycemic control and lower the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. However, little literature is available regarding the use of IF in managing DM. This review intends to elucidate the role of intermittent fasting in preventing and treating DM, including its benefits and limitations. From the various studies reviewed in this article, it can be deduced that intermittent fasting can achieve suitable glycemic targets and weight control.",

Growing evidence suggests that dietary interventions can significantly impact this process by modulating fundamental molecular pathways. This review focuses on the potential of targeted dietary strategies in promoting healthy aging and the mechanisms by which specific nutrients and dietary patterns influence key pathways involved in cellular repair, inflammation, and metabolic regulation. Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, the Mediterranean diet, as well as the ketogenic diet showed promising effects on promoting healthy aging, possibly by modulating mTORC1 AMPK, an insulin signaling pathway. By understanding the intricate interplay between diet and molecular pathways, we can develop personalized dietary strategies that not only prevent age-related diseases, but also promote overall health and well-being throughout the aging process.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: intermittent fasting plans propose to limit food intake during specific periods as nutritional therapeutic strategies to treat different metabolic conditions in various clinical entities. However, the heterogeneity between each context of intermittent fasting could generate different results in metabolic parameters. Objective: to evaluate the clinical application of intermittent fasting and to discern whether it offers advantages over other traditional strategies. Methods: structured questions were formulated (PICO), and the methodology followed the guidelines established by the PRISMA 2020 statement. The search was conducted in different databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar). Results: we found 3,962 articles, of which 56 were finally included; 3,906 articles that did not directly or indirectly answer the structured questions were excluded. Conclusions: compared to conventional diets, the various AI schemes do not generate advantages or disadvantages in terms of weight loss and lipid profile, although in the alternate-day variant there are greater insulin reductions than those observed in the continuous energy restriction. The heterogeneity of the interventions, the populations studied, the comparators, the results, and the type of design make it impossible to extrapolate the effects found in all clinical scenarios and generalize the recommendations.",

In this study, we investigated the influence of intermittent fasting (IF) on these aging-related declines, using male C57BL/6J mice. Our findings revealed that IF significantly preserved reproductive success in aged mice, not by improving traditional reproductive metrics such as sperm quality or endocrine functions but by enhancing mating behavior. This behavioral improvement was attributed to IF's ability to counter age-dependent increases in serotonergic inhibition, primarily through the decreased supply of the serotonin precursor tryptophan from the periphery to the brain. Our research underscores the potential of dietary interventions like IF in mitigating age-associated declines in male reproductive health and suggests a novel approach to managing conditions related to reduced sexual desire, highlighting the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and reproductive behavior.",

      "title": "Timing of energy intake and the therapeutic potential of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in NAFLD.",
      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a major public health concern and is associated with a substantial global burden of liver-related and cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. High total energy intake coupled with unhealthy consumption of ultra-processed foods and saturated fats have long been regarded as major dietary drivers of NAFLD. However, there is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that the timing of energy intake across a the day is also an important determinant of individual risk for NAFLD and associated metabolic conditions. This review summarises the available observational and epidemiological data describing associations between eating patterns and metabolic disease, including the negative effects of irregular meal patterns, skipping breakfast and night-time eating on liver health. We suggest that that these harmful behaviours deserve greater consideration in the risk stratification and management of patients with NAFLD particularly in a 24-hour society with continuous availability of food and with up to 20% of the population now engaged in shiftwork with mistimed eating patterns. We also draw on studies reporting the liver-specific impact of Ramadan, which represents a unique real-world opportunity to explore the physiological impact of fasting. By highlighting data from preclinical and pilot human studies, we present a further biological rationale for manipulating timing of energy intake to improve metabolic health and discuss how this may be mediated through restoration of natural circadian rhythms. Lastly, we comprehensively review the landscape of human trials of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in metabolic disease and offer a look to the future about how these dietary strategies may benefit patients with NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

      "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a highly prevalent progressive joint disease that still requires an optimal therapeutic approach. Intermittent fasting is an attractive dieting strategy for improving health. Here this study shows that intermittent fasting potently relieves medial meniscus (DMM)- or natural aging-induced osteoarthritic phenotypes. Osteocytes, the most abundant bone cells, secrete excess neuropeptide Y (NPY) during osteoarthritis, and this alteration can be altered by intermittent fasting. Both NPY and the NPY-abundant culture medium of osteocytes (OCY-CM) from osteoarthritic mice possess pro-inflammatory, pro-osteoclastic, and pro-neurite outgrowth effects, while OCY-CM from the intermittent fasting-treated osteoarthritic mice fails to induce significant stimulatory effects on inflammation, osteoclast formation, and neurite outgrowth. Depletion of osteocyte NPY significantly attenuates DMM-induced osteoarthritis and abolishes the benefits of intermittent fasting on osteoarthritis. This study suggests that osteocyte NPY is a key contributing factor in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and intermittent fasting represents a promising nonpharmacological antiosteoarthritis method by targeting osteocyte NPY.",

      "abstract": "Studies have found that intermittent fasting (IF) can prevent diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and neuropathy, while in humans it has helped to alleviate metabolic syndrome, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and many other disorders. IF involves a series of coordinated metabolic and hormonal changes to maintain the organism's metabolic balance and cellular homeostasis. More importantly, IF can activate hepatic autophagy, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance, quality control, cell and tissue remodeling, and defense against extracellular damage and pathogens. IF affects hepatic autophagy through multiple interacting pathways and molecular mechanisms, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), silent mating-type information regulatory 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1), peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as well as signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms such as glucagon and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). These pathways can stimulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), play a cytoprotective role, downregulate the expression of aging-related molecules, and prevent the development of steatosis-associated liver tumors. By influencing the metabolism of energy and oxygen radicals as well as cellular stress response systems, IF protects hepatocytes from genetic and environmental factors. By activating hepatic autophagy, IF has a potential role in treating a variety of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A better understanding of the effects of IF on liver autophagy may lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of liver disease.",

      "abstract": "Obesity in the United States is pervasive and associated with morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs. For women, obesity may affect stages of life including early menarche, fertility, pregnancy, and menopause as a result of hormonal imbalances and insulin resistance. The insulin-carbohydrate model of obesity has been proposed as an explanation for growing obesity rates and can be used to target weight loss strategies by increasing insulin sensitivity. Together, low-carbohydrate dietary patterns along with intermittent fasting may help individuals with insulin resistance not only lose weight but also increase their insulin sensitivity. The purpose of this article is to review the epidemiology and physiology of obesity and the indicators for health while outlining strategies for nurses and other clinicians to use when counseling women who are following a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet with intermittent fasting for weight management.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic risk factors, characterized by abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), hypertension, and insulin resistance. Lifestyle modifications, especially dietary habits, are the main therapeutic strategy for the treatment and management of metabolic syndrome, but the most effective dietary pattern for its management has not been established. Specific dietary modifications, such as improving the quality of the foods or changing macronutrient distribution, showed beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome conditions and individual parameters. On comparing low-fat and restricted diets, the scientific evidence supports the use of the Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet intervention as the new paradigm for metabolic syndrome prevention and treatment. The nutritional distribution and quality of these healthy diets allows health professionals to provide easy-to-follow dietary advice without the need for restricted diets. Nonetheless, energy-restricted dietary patterns and improvements in physical activity are crucial to improve the metabolic disturbances observed in metabolic syndrome patients.",

Weight loss diets are available that include various permutations of energy restriction, macronutrients, foods, and dietary intake patterns. Caloric restriction is the common pathway for weight reduction, but different diets may induce weight loss by varied additional mechanisms, including by facilitating dietary adherence. This narrative Review of meta-analyses and select clinical trials found that lower-calorie diets, compared with higher-calorie regimens, reliably induced larger short-term (<6 months) weight losses, with deterioration of this benefit over the long term (>12 months). Few significant long-term differences in weight loss were observed for diets of varying macronutrient composition, although some regimens were found to have short-term advantages (e.g., low carbohydrate versus low fat). Progress in improving dietary adherence, which is critical to both short- and long-term weight loss, could result from greater efforts to identify behavioral and metabolic phenotypes among dieters.",

      "abstract": "Evidence from observational studies and randomized trials suggests that prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) can develop in genetically susceptible individuals in parallel with weight (that is, fat) gain. Accordingly, studies show that weight loss can produce remission of T2DM in a dose-dependent manner. A weight loss of ~15 kg, achieved by calorie restriction as part of an intensive management programme, can lead to remission of T2DM in ~80% of patients with obesity and T2DM. However, long-term weight loss maintenance is challenging. Obesity and T2DM are associated with diminished glucose uptake in the brain that impairs the satiating effect of dietary carbohydrate; therefore, carbohydrate restriction might help maintain weight loss and maximize metabolic benefits. Likewise, increases in physical activity and fitness are an important contributor to T2DM remission when combined with calorie restriction and weight loss. Preliminary studies suggest that a precision dietary management approach that uses pretreatment glycaemic status to stratify patients can help optimize dietary recommendations with respect to carbohydrate, fat and dietary fibre. This approach might lead to improved weight loss maintenance and glycaemic control. Future research should focus on better understanding the individual response to dietary treatment and translating these findings into clinical practice.",

There is substantial interest in exploring the role of diet-related interventions in both symptomatic management and potential disease modification. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of several dietary patterns, including the Mediterranean (MeDi), Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND), Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), vegan/vegetarian, and ketogenic diet in persons with PD. Additionally, we provide an overview of the evidence relating several individual food groups and nutritional supplements to PD risk, symptoms and progression.",

      "abstract": "Adverse food reactions include immune-mediated food allergies and non-immune-mediated intolerances. However, this distinction and the involvement of different pathogenetic mechanisms are often confused. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the perceived vs. actual prevalence of immune-mediated food allergies and non-immune reactions to food that are extremely common. The risk of an inappropriate approach to their correct identification can lead to inappropriate diets with severe nutritional deficiencies. This narrative review provides an outline of the pathophysiologic and clinical features of immune and non-immune adverse reactions to food-along with general diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Special emphasis is placed on specific nutritional concerns for each of these conditions from the combined point of view of gastroenterology and immunology, in an attempt to offer a useful tool to practicing physicians in discriminating these diverging disease entities and planning their correct management. We conclude that a correct diagnostic approach and dietary control of both immune- and non-immune-mediated food-induced diseases might minimize the nutritional gaps in these patients, thus helping to improve their quality of life and reduce the economic costs of their management.",

      "abstract": "Despite considerable advances in pharmacological treatments, hypertension remains a major cause of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide since elevated blood pressure (BP) adversely influences cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, the current hypertension guidelines recommend the adoption of dietary modifications in all subjects with suboptimal BP levels. These modifications include salt intake reduction and a healthy diet, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), independently of the underlying antihypertensive drug treatment. However, dietary modifications for BP reduction in adults with prehypertension or hypertension are usually examined as stand-alone interventions and, to a lesser extent, in combination with other dietary changes. The purpose of the present review was to summarize the evidence regarding the BP effect of salt restriction in the context of the DASH diet and the MedDiet. We also summarize the literature regarding the effects of these dietary modifications when they are applied as the only intervention for BP reduction in adults with and without hypertension and the potent physiological mechanisms underlying their beneficial effects on BP levels. Available data of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provided evidence about the significant BP-lowering effect of each one of these dietary strategies, especially among subjects with hypertension since they modulate various physiological mechanisms controlling BP. Salt reduction by 2.3 g per day in the DASH diet produces less than half of the effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (-3.0/-1.6 mmHg) as it does without the DASH diet (-6.7/-3.5 mmHg). Although their combined effect is not fully additive, low sodium intake and the DASH diet produce higher SBP/DBP reduction (-8.9/-4.5 mmHg) than each of these dietary regimens alone. It is yet unsettled whether this finding is also true for salt reduction in the MedDiet.",

      "abstract": "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a clinical entity characterized by the absence of celiac disease and wheat allergy in patients that trigger reproducible symptomatic responses to gluten-containing foods consumption. Due to the lack of sensitive and reproducible biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, placebo-controlled gluten challenges must be carried out for its diagnosis. The gluten challenges can be either double- or single-blind, for research or clinical practice purposes, respectively. For improving our understanding about the magnitude and relevance of NCGS in different populations, epidemiological studies based on self-report have been carried out. However, the gluten challenge-based prevalence of NCGS remains to be estimated. Since NCGS was recently recognized as a clinical entity, more studies are needed to delve into NCGS pathogenesis, for instance, the molecular interactions between the suspected cereal grain components that trigger NCGS, such as fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) and amylase and trypsin inhibitors, and the immune system remains to be elucidated. Although still under debate, NCGS patients can be susceptible to only one or more than one of the NCGS triggers. The treatment of NCGS involves the dietary restriction of the suspected triggers of the disease, but there is controversial data about the effectiveness of different dietary interventions such as the gluten-free diet and low-FODMAP diet. Certainly, our understanding of NCGS is improving quickly due to the constant availability of new scientific information on this topic. Thus, the aim of the present narrative review is to present an up-to-date overview on NCGS from epidemiology to current therapy.",

      "abstract": "Various nutritional therapies have been proposed in rheumatoid arthritis, particularly diets rich in ω-3 fatty acids, which may lead to eicosanoid reduction. Our aim was to investigate the effect of potentially anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, vegetarian, vegan, ketogenic) on pain. The primary outcome was pain on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes were C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, health assessment questionnaire, disease activity score 28, tender/swollen joint counts, weight, and body mass index. We searched MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL for studies published from database inception to 12 November 2021. Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted study data, and assessed the risk of bias. We performed a meta-analysis with all eligible randomized controlled trials using RevMan 5. We used mean differences or standardized mean differences and the inverse variance method of pooling using a random-effects model. The search retrieved 564 unique publications, of which we included 12 in the systematic review and 7 in the meta-analysis. All studies had a high risk of bias and the evidence was very low. The main conclusion is that anti-inflammatory diets resulted in significantly lower pain than ordinary diets (-9.22 mm; 95% CI -14.15 to -4.29; ",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Immunological, genetic, and environmental factors, including diet, play a part in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Metabolic syndrome or its components are frequent co-morbidities in persons with psoriasis. A change of eating habits can improve the quality of life of patients by relieving skin lesions and by reducing the risk of other diseases. A low-energy diet is recommended for patients with excess body weight. Persons suffering from psoriasis should limit the intake of saturated fatty acids and replace them with polyunsaturated fatty acids from the omega-3 family, which have an anti-inflammatory effect. In diet therapy for persons with psoriasis, the introduction of antioxidants such as vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, flavonoids, and selenium is extremely important. Vitamin D supplementation is also recommended. Some authors suggest that alternative diets have a positive effect on the course of psoriasis. These diets include: a gluten-free diet, a vegetarian diet, and a Mediterranean diet. Diet therapy for patients with psoriasis should also be tailored to pharmacological treatment. For instance, folic acid supplementation is introduced in persons taking methotrexate. The purpose of this paper is to discuss in detail the nutritional recommendations for persons with psoriasis.",

      "abstract": "Background Nonpharmacologic interventions that modify lifestyle can lower blood pressure (BP) and have been assessed in numerous randomized controlled trials and pairwise meta-analyses. It is still unclear which intervention would be most efficacious. Methods and Results Bayesian network meta-analyses were performed to estimate the comparative effectiveness of different interventions for lowering BP. From 60 166 potentially relevant articles, 120 eligible articles (14 923 participants) with a median follow-up of 12 weeks, assessing 22 nonpharmacologic interventions, were included. According to the surface under the cumulative ranking probabilities and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) quality of evidence, for adults with prehypertension to established hypertension, high-quality evidence indicated that the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) was superior to usual care and all other nonpharmacologic interventions in lowering systolic BP (weighted mean difference, 6.97 mm Hg; 95% credible interval, 4.50-9.47) and diastolic BP (weighted mean difference, 3.54 mm Hg; 95% credible interval, 1.80-5.28). Compared with usual care, moderate- to high-quality evidence indicated that aerobic exercise, isometric training, low-sodium and high-potassium salt, comprehensive lifestyle modification, breathing-control, and meditation could lower systolic BP and diastolic BP. For patients with hypertension, moderate- to high-quality evidence suggested that the interventions listed (except comprehensive lifestyle modification) were associated with greater systolic BP and diastolic BP reduction than usual care; salt restriction was also effective in lowering both systolic BP and diastolic BP. Among overweight and obese participants, low-calorie diet and low-calorie diet plus exercise could lower more BP than exercise. Conclusions DASH might be the most effective intervention in lowering BP for adults with prehypertension to established hypertension. Aerobic exercise, isometric training, low-sodium and high-potassium salt, comprehensive lifestyle modification, salt restriction, breathing-control, meditation and low-calorie diet also have obvious effects on BP reduction.",

      "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviours, including diet and physical activity, coupled with genetic predisposition, drive type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence and severity; the present review aims to summarise the most recent nutritional approaches in T2D, outlining unmet needs. Guidelines consistently suggest reducing energy intake to counteract the obesity epidemic, frequently resulting in sarcopenic obesity, a condition associated with poorer metabolic control and cardiovascular disease. Various dietary approaches have been proposed with largely similar results, with a preference for the Mediterranean diet and the best practice being the diet that patients feel confident of maintaining in the long term based on individual preferences. Patient adherence is indeed the pivotal factor for weight loss and long-term maintenance, requiring intensive lifestyle intervention. The consumption of nutritional supplements continues to increase even if international societies do not support their systematic use. Inositols and vitamin D supplementation, as well as micronutrients (zinc, chromium, magnesium) and pre/probiotics, result in modest improvement in insulin sensitivity, but their use is not systematically suggested. To reach the desired goals, patients should be actively involved in the collaborative development of a personalised meal plan associated with habitual physical activity, aiming at normal body weight and metabolic control.",

      "title": "Polycystic Kidney Disease Diet: What is Known and What is Safe.",
      "abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by kidney cyst formation and progressive kidney function loss. Dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet have recently emerged as potential strategies to induce metabolic reprogramming and slow ADPKD progression. We review the available evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of these interventions in ADPKD. Dietary interventions show promise in managing ADPKD by improving metabolic health and reducing oxidative stress. However, while preclinical studies have shown favorable outcomes, limited clinical evidence supports their effectiveness. In addition, the long-term consequences of these dietary interventions, including their effect on adverse events in patients with ADPKD, remain uncertain. To optimize ADPKD management, patients are advised to follow a dietary regimen that aims to achieve or maintain an ideal body weight and includes high fluid intake, low sodium, and limited concentrated sweets. Caloric restriction seems particularly beneficial for patients with overweight or obesity because it promotes weight loss and improves metabolic parameters. Supplementation with curcumin, ginkgolide B, saponins, vitamin E, niacinamide, or triptolide has demonstrated uncertain clinical benefit in patients with ADPKD. Notably, β -hydroxybutyrate supplements have shown promise in animal models; however, their safety and efficacy in ADPKD require further evaluation through well-designed clinical trials. Therefore, the use of these supplements is not currently recommended for patients with ADPKD. In summary, dietary interventions such as caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, and ketogenic diet hold promise in ADPKD management by enhancing metabolic health. However, extensive clinical research is necessary to establish their effectiveness and long-term effects. Adhering to personalized dietary guidelines, including weight management and specific nutritional restrictions, can contribute to optimal ADPKD management. Future research should prioritize well-designed clinical trials to determine the benefits and safety of dietary interventions and supplementation in ADPKD.",

      "abstract": "Patients with gastroparesis often have signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort, and early satiety, thus leading to inadequate food intake and a high risk of malnutrition. There is a considerable scarcity of data about nutritional strategies for gastroparesis, and current practices rely on extrapolated evidence. Some approaches include the modification of food composition, food consistency, and food volume in the context of delayed gastric emptying. If the patient is unable to consume adequate calories through a solid food diet, stepwise nutritional interventions could include the use of liquid meals, oral nutrition supplements, enteral nutrition, and parenteral nutrition. This Review discusses the role, rationale, and current evidence of diverse nutritional interventions in the management of gastroparesis.",

      "abstract": "There is currently a growing interest in diets and physical activity patterns that may be beneficial in preventing and treating breast cancer (BC). Mounting evidence indicates that indeed, the so-called Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and regular physical activity likely both help reduce the risk of developing BC. For those who have already received a BC diagnosis, these interventions may decrease the risk of tumor recurrence after treatment and improve quality of life. Studies also show the potential of other dietary interventions, including fasting or modified fasting, calorie restriction, ketogenic diets, and vegan or plant-based diets, to enhance the efficacy of BC therapies. In this review article, we discuss the biological rationale for utilizing these dietary interventions and physical activity in BC prevention and treatment. We highlight published and ongoing clinical studies that have applied these lifestyle interventions to BC patients. This review offers valuable insights into the potential application of these dietary interventions and physical activity as complimentary therapies in BC management.",

However, most evidence regarding the altered sodium handling, fluid homeostasis and congestion-related signs and symptoms in patients with HF originates from untreated patient cohorts and physiological investigations. Recent data challenge the beneficial role of dietary sodium and fluid restriction in HF. Consequently, the European Society of Cardiology HF guidelines have gradually downgraded these recommendations over time, now advising for the limitation of salt intake to no more than 5 g/day in patients with HF, while contemplating fluid restriction of 1.5-2 L/day only in selected patients. Therefore, the objective of this clinical consensus statement is to provide advice on fluid and sodium intake in patients with acute and chronic HF, based on contemporary evidence and expert opinion.",

The aim of this review was to clarify the efficiency and indications of a low-\"fermentable oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols\" (FODMAP) diet (LFD) in CD and to further analyze the available data on other types of diets. PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and WILEY databases were screened for relevant publications regarding the effect of FODMAP diets on CD. Our search identified 12 articles analyzing the effect of an LFD in CD, 5 articles analyzing the effect of a Mediterranean diet (MD), 2 articles analyzing the effect of a vegetarian diet (VD), and 2 articles analyzing the effect of a low-lactose diet (LLD). The majority of the studies included in this review show the significant efficiency of the LFD in CD patients. We found significant evidence demonstrating that the LFD has a favorable impact on gastrointestinal symptoms in CD patients. Notwithstanding the evidence, it remains to be established if an LFD is more efficient than other types of diets in the short term and especially in the long term.",

      "abstract": "The intake of food may be an initiator of adverse reactions. Food intolerance is an abnormal non-immunological response of the organism to the ingestion of food or its components in a dosage normally tolerated. Despite the fact that food intolerance is spread throughout the world, its diagnosing is still difficult. Histamine intolerance (HIT) is the term for that type of food intolerance which includes a set of undesirable reactions as a result of accumulated or ingested histamine. Manifestations may be caused by various pathophysiological mechanisms or a combination of them. The problem with a \"diagnosis\" of HIT is precisely the inconstancy and variety of the manifestations in the same individual following similar stimuli. The diagnosing of HIT therefore requires a complex time-demanding multidisciplinary approach, including the systematic elimination of disorders with a similar manifestation of symptoms. Among therapeutic approaches, the gold standard is a low-histamine diet. A good response to such a diet is considered to be confirmation of HIT. Alongside the dietary measures, DAO supplementation supporting the degradation of ingested histamine may be considered as subsidiary treatment for individuals with intestinal DAO deficiency. If antihistamines are indicated, the treatment should be conscious and time-limited, while 2nd or 3rd generation of H",

      "abstract": "Bone metabolism is a process in which osteoclasts continuously clear old bone and osteoblasts form osteoid and mineralization within basic multicellular units, which are in a dynamic balance. The process of bone metabolism is affected by many factors, including diet. Reasonable dietary patterns play a vital role in the prevention and treatment of bone-related diseases. In recent years, dietary patterns have changed dramatically. With the continuous improvement in the quality of life, high amounts of sugar, fat and protein have become a part of people's daily diets. However, people have gradually realized the importance of a healthy diet, intermittent fasting, calorie restriction, a vegetarian diet, and moderate exercise. Although these dietary patterns have traditionally been considered healthy, their true impact on bone health are still unclear. Studies have found that caloric restriction and a vegetarian diet can reduce bone mass, the negative impact of a high-sugar and high-fat dietary (HSFD) pattern on bone health is far greater than the positive impact of the mechanical load, and the relationship between a high-protein diet (HPD) and bone health remains controversial. Calcium, vitamin D, and dairy products play an important role in preventing bone loss. In this article, we further explore the relationship between different dietary patterns and bone health, and provide a reference for how to choose the appropriate dietary pattern in the future and for how to prevent bone loss caused by long-term poor dietary patterns in children, adolescents, and the elderly. In addition, this review provides dietary references for the clinical treatment of bone-related diseases and suggests that health policy makers should consider dietary measures to prevent and treat bone loss.",

      "abstract": "Lifestyle improvement is a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention and has a relevant effect on blood pressure control. During the last decades the attention of the researcher has focused on low-salt diets as the lifestyle modification most effective in blood pressure reduction. Current international guidelines thus suggest to stress the importance of the implementation of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and of a low-salt Mediterranean diet to achieve the best results in term of blood pressure decrease. However, salt reduction in diet could be not the only nor the main determinant of blood pressure reduction under dietary treatment. DASH and low-salt Mediterranean diet are also characterized by a high intake of vegetables (NO and polyphenol sources), whole grains, some low-fat dairy products, and low intake of red meat, sugar, and trans-hydrogenated fats. Lacto-ovo vegetarian diet are also per se associated to a significant improvement in blood pressure levels. Moreover, these diets are particularly effective when associated with a significant weight loss. Furthermore, blood pressure can also be lowered by some nutraceuticals (beetroot, magnesium, vitamin C, catechin-rich beverages, lycopene, etc). The aim of this narrative review is to critically resume the most recent evidence supporting a complete approach to dietary counseling for hypertension prevention and management.",

      "abstract": "Diet, serving as a vital source of nutrients, exerts a profound influence on human health and disease progression. Recently, dietary interventions have emerged as promising adjunctive treatment strategies not only for cancer but also for neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic disorders. These interventions have demonstrated substantial potential in modulating metabolism, disease trajectory, and therapeutic responses. Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of malignant progression, and a deeper understanding of this phenomenon in tumors and its effects on immune regulation is a significant challenge that impedes cancer eradication. Dietary intake, as a key environmental factor, can influence tumor metabolism. Emerging evidence indicates that dietary interventions might affect the nutrient availability in tumors, thereby increasing the efficacy of cancer treatments. However, the intricate interplay between dietary interventions and the pathogenesis of cancer and other diseases is complex. Despite encouraging results, the mechanisms underlying diet-based therapeutic strategies remain largely unexplored, often resulting in underutilization in disease management. In this review, we aim to illuminate the potential effects of various dietary interventions, including calorie restriction, fasting-mimicking diet, ketogenic diet, protein restriction diet, high-salt diet, high-fat diet, and high-fiber diet, on cancer and the aforementioned diseases. We explore the multifaceted impacts of these dietary interventions, encompassing their immunomodulatory effects, other biological impacts, and underlying molecular mechanisms. This review offers valuable insights into the potential application of these dietary interventions as adjunctive therapies in disease management.",

This is a 2 × 2 factorial study with diets of 20% or 40% fat and 15% or 25% protein with a graded carbohydrate intake of 35, 45, 55 and 65%. Weight loss, overall, was modest at nearly 6% with all four diets, and no significant dietary difference. The variability in weight loss in each diet group was significant, ranging from greater than 20% to a small weight gain. Studies of genetic variations in relation to weight loss showed that the diet that was selected could significantly affect weight loss, emphasizing that there is no ideal diet and more than one diet can be used to treat obesity. Weight loss was also influenced by the level of baseline triiodothyronine or thyroxine, and baseline carbohydrate and insulin resistance. Achieving a stable Health Eating Food Diversity Index, eating more protein, eating more fiber, engaging in more physical activity, sleeping better and eating less ultra-processed foods were beneficial strategies for weight loss in this trial. Although there is no \"ideal diet\", both the DASH diet and the Mediterranean diet have clinical trials showing their significant benefit for cardiovascular risk factors. Finally, the lesson of the \"Last Chance Diet\", which recommended a diet with protein from gelatin, proved that some diets could be hazardous.",

      "abstract": "Nutrition is the primary source of energy production for myocardial contractility and to maintaining cardiac efficiency. Although many studies provided evidence of the benefits of nutritional intervention in chronic heart failure patients (CHF), these effects are not still completely understood. We searched in PubMed and Embase articles related to the following keywords: \"chronic heart failure\" with \"diet,\" \"nutrition,\" \"insulin resistance,\" and \"caloric restriction.\" Of the 975 retrieved articles, 20 have been selected. The primary endpoint was the left ventricular (LV) function and the secondary mortality rate in HF patients. Some studies showed that the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) had a beneficial effect on cardiac function, while others did not find any positive impact. Nutritional supplements and hypercaloric intake had positive effects on underweight HF patients, while hypocaloric diet was beneficial in obese HF patients improving glucose control and cardiac function. The effect of MedDiet in HF patients showed conflicting results. Changes in the dietary pattern can reduce the evolution of HF, considering not only the quality of food but also the caloric intake. The discriminant factor to prescribe a diet regime in HF patients is represented by body mass index (BMI). A well-balanced caloric diet represents an effective therapy in overweight HF patients to reduce the mortality rate. Long-term studies evaluating cause-effect of energy and macronutrients intake on cardiac function in HF patients are necessary.",

      "abstract": "Infertility affects 15% of the population in developed countries, and its prevalence is increasing. Fertility can be influenced by different factors. Although key factors like maternal age cannot be changed, there is growing evidence that other modifiable factors, such as diet, can have an impact on fertility. Diet has become increasingly important in recent years for a number of reasons: the new trend toward a healthy lifestyle, the higher prevalence of certain digestive disorders, a lack of time that leads people to consume more prepared and processed food, and personal choice to not eat meat, among others. To meet these needs, several diets have recently become popular, such as the Mediterranean diet, known as the gold standard of health; the DASH diet, known for preventing hypertension; the Western diet, characterized by processed food; the ketogenic diet, characterized by low carbohydrate intake; and the vegetarian diet, which is the choice for people who do not eat meat or animal by-products. Diets present a unique composition characterized by the presence or absence of specific nutrients, which have also been associated with male and female fertility individually. This review assesses the impact of these diets and of macro- and micronutrients on both female and male fertility.",

      "abstract": "As the population ages, promoting healthy aging through targeted interventions becomes increasingly crucial. Growing evidence suggests that dietary interventions can significantly impact this process by modulating fundamental molecular pathways. This review focuses on the potential of targeted dietary strategies in promoting healthy aging and the mechanisms by which specific nutrients and dietary patterns influence key pathways involved in cellular repair, inflammation, and metabolic regulation. Caloric restriction, intermittent fasting, the Mediterranean diet, as well as the ketogenic diet showed promising effects on promoting healthy aging, possibly by modulating mTORC1 AMPK, an insulin signaling pathway. By understanding the intricate interplay between diet and molecular pathways, we can develop personalized dietary strategies that not only prevent age-related diseases, but also promote overall health and well-being throughout the aging process.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the use of the ketogenic diet as a proper nutritional treatment for lipedema has been hypothesized in the literature. This is the first clinical study evaluating the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy in lipedema patients. In the present study, it was decided to use a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in combination with carboxytherapy. Since lipedema is characterized by microangiopathy, local hypoxia, and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) deposition, carboxytherapy could improve painful symptoms and skin tone. A total of 22 subjects were included in the data analysis, divided into three groups; 8 patients underwent MMKD combined with carboxytherapy sessions (KDCB group), 8 underwent MMKD nutritional treatment alone (KD group), and 6 patients underwent only carboxytherapy sessions (CB group), for a total of 10 weeks of treatment for all three groups. It was observed that the ketogenic diet effectively induced weight and fat mass loss, including in the limbs, areas considered unresponsive to diet therapy in lipedema patients. However, the best results were obtained from the combination of the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy, which showed improvements in both body composition and skin texture and a reduction in pain, along with an improvement in sleep quality. It would be helpful to conduct a clinical trial on a larger scale and over a more extended period to observe the results in the long term as well.",

      "abstract": "This review aims to present a comprehensive state-of-the-art analysis of the bidirectional crosstalk between gut microbiota and the central nervous system (CNS). The literature concerning the potential effects of gut microbiota on psychiatric disorders through neural pathways comprising the 'gut-brain axis' were gathered. In addition, the influence of probiotics and prebiotics and dairy-rich diets combined with the intake of probiotics and prebiotics on gut microbiota and the subsequent relationship with brain function was reviewed. However, a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation in psychiatric disorders is lacking. Therefore, a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases from January 1969 to December 2019 was conducted. It led to the identification of a total of 844 research articles. Of these, a total of 23 studies met the meta-analysis criteria. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the symptoms of schizophrenia, stress, and anxiety between probiotic and placebo groups, post-intervention. Probiotic administration reduced depressive symptoms among patients with depression in a statistically significant manner (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.87; 95% confidence interval (95% confidence interval): -1.66, -0.99; ",

      "abstract": "Although cancer is still one of the most significant global challenges facing public health, the world still lacks complementary approaches that would significantly enhance the efficacy of standard anticancer therapies. One of the essential strategies during cancer treatment is following a healthy diet program. The ketogenic diet (KD) has recently emerged as a metabolic therapy in cancer treatment, targeting cancer cell metabolism rather than a conventional dietary approach. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat and very-low-carbohydrate with adequate amounts of protein, has shown antitumor effects by reducing energy supplies to cells. This low energy supply inhibits tumor growth, explaining the ketogenic diet's therapeutic mechanisms in cancer treatment. This review highlights the crucial mechanisms that explain the ketogenic diet's potential antitumor effects, which probably produces an unfavorable metabolic environment for cancer cells and can be used as a promising adjuvant in cancer therapy. Studies discussed in this review provide a solid background for researchers and physicians to design new combination therapies based on KD and conventional therapies.",

      "title": "The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) Diet for the Aging Brain: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "The Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet seems a promising approach to preserve brain function during aging. Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated benefits of the MIND diet for cognition and dementia, though an update is needed. Additionally, other outcomes relevant to brain aging have not been summarized. Therefore, this systematic review aims to give an up-to-date and complete overview on human studies that examined the MIND diet in relation to brain aging outcomes in adults aged ≥40 y. Ovid Medline, Web of Science core collection, and Scopus were searched up to July 25, 2023. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool. We included 40 articles, of which 32 were unique cohorts. Higher MIND diet adherence was protective of dementia in 7 of 10 cohorts. Additionally, positive associations were demonstrated in 3 of 4 cohorts for global cognition and 4 of 6 cohorts for episodic memory. The protective effects of the MIND diet on cognitive decline are less apparent, with only 2 of 7 longitudinal cohorts demonstrating positive associations for global decline and 1 of 6 for episodic memory decline. For other brain outcomes (domain-specific cognition, cognitive impairments, Parkinson's disease, brain volume, and pathology), results were mixed or only few studies had been performed. Many of the cohorts demonstrating protective associations were of North American origin, raising the question if the most favorable diet for healthy brain aging is population-dependent. In conclusion, this systematic review provides observational evidence for protective associations between the MIND diet and global cognition and dementia risk, but evidence for other brain outcomes remains mixed and/or limited. The MIND diet may be the preferred diet for healthy brain aging in North American populations, though evidence for other populations seems less conclusive. This review was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42022254625.",

      "abstract": "Despite being a focal issue to patients, the effect of diet on adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains underexplored with limited guidance. While promising clinical trials are currently underway, there is a need for further evidence-based recommendations. As such, we summarize the current evidence on various diets used in the treatment of IBD and also explore the potential applications of dietary data from related immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, to provide additional information to inform IBD providers. To date, there have been multiple diets investigated as adjunctive therapy in IBD, but many associated studies are small, non-randomized, and not controlled. Mediterranean, vegetarian/vegan, and reduced-calorie/fasting diets have been studied and have shown some positive results in other IMIDs, which may suggest potential applicability to those with IBD, but larger, well-designed clinical trials are needed for further guidance. Gluten-free and low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP)diets do not appear to have an impact on IBD disease activity, but low FODMAP may potentially be helpful for those with concurrent functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Specific carbohydrate diets have been mainly assessed in children but show some potential in small adult studies.",

      "abstract": "Dietary protein restriction has long been a cornerstone of nutritional therapy for patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD). However, the recommended amount of dietary protein intake is different across guidelines. This is partly because previous randomized controlled trials have reported conflicting results regarding the efficacy of protein restriction in terms of kidney outcomes. Interestingly, a vegetarian, very low protein diet has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney failure among patients with advanced CKD, without increasing the incidence of hyperkalemia. This finding suggests that the source of protein may also influence the kidney outcomes. Furthermore, a plant-dominant low-protein diet (PLADO) has recently been proposed as an alternative dietary therapy for patients with CKD. There are several potential mechanisms by which plant-based diets would benefit patients with CKD. For example, plant-based diets may reduce the production of gut-derived uremic toxins by increasing the intake of fiber, and are useful for correcting metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia. Plant proteins are less likely to induce glomerular hyperfiltration than animal proteins. Furthermore, plant-based diets increase magnesium intake, which may prevent vascular calcification. More evidence is needed to establish the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of PLADO as a new adjunct therapy in real-world patients with CKD.",

      "abstract": "Dietary modification is central to obesity treatment. Weight loss diets are available that include various permutations of energy restriction, macronutrients, foods, and dietary intake patterns. Caloric restriction is the common pathway for weight reduction, but different diets may induce weight loss by varied additional mechanisms, including by facilitating dietary adherence. This narrative Review of meta-analyses and select clinical trials found that lower-calorie diets, compared with higher-calorie regimens, reliably induced larger short-term (<6 months) weight losses, with deterioration of this benefit over the long term (>12 months). Few significant long-term differences in weight loss were observed for diets of varying macronutrient composition, although some regimens were found to have short-term advantages (e.g., low carbohydrate versus low fat). Progress in improving dietary adherence, which is critical to both short- and long-term weight loss, could result from greater efforts to identify behavioral and metabolic phenotypes among dieters.",

      "abstract": "The global human population has recently experienced an increase in life expectancy with a mounting concern about the steady rise in the incidence of age-associated chronic diseases and socio-economic burden. Calorie restriction (CR), the reduction of energy intake without malnutrition, is a dietary manipulation that can increase health and longevity in most model organisms. However, the practice of CR in day-to-day life is a challenging long-term goal for human intervention. Recently, daily fasting length and periodicity have emerged as potential drivers behind CR's beneficial health effects. Numerous strategies and eating patterns have been successfully developed to recapitulate many of CR's benefits without its austerity. These novel feeding protocols range from shortened meal timing designed to interact with our circadian system (e.g., daily time-restricted feeding) to more extended fasting regimens known as intermittent fasting. Here, we provide a glimpse of the current status of knowledge on different strategies to reap the benefits of CR on metabolic health in murine models and in humans, without the rigor of continuous reduction in caloric intake as presented at the USU State of the Science Symposium.",

TRE involves confining the eating window to 4-10 h per day and fasting for the remaining hours (14-20 h fast). During the eating window, individuals are not required to monitor food intake. The sudden rise in popularity of TRE is most likely due to its simplicity and the fact that it does not require individuals to count calories to lose weight. This feature of TRE may appeal to certain individuals with obesity, and this could help produce lasting metabolic health improvements. The purpose of this review is to summarize current evidence from randomized clinical trials of TRE (without calorie counting) on body weight and metabolic risk factors. The efficacy of TRE in various populations groups, including those with obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), is also examined.",

      "abstract": "Each cell is equipped with a conserved housekeeping mechanism, known as autophagy, to recycle exhausted materials and dispose of injured organelles via lysosomal degradation. Autophagy is an early-stage cellular response to stress stimuli in both physiological and pathological situations. It is thought that the promotion of autophagy flux prevents host cells from subsequent injuries by removing damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. As a correlate, the modulation of autophagy is suggested as a therapeutic approach in diverse pathological conditions. Accumulated evidence suggests that intermittent fasting or calorie restriction can lead to the induction of adaptive autophagy and increase longevity of eukaryotic cells. However, prolonged calorie restriction with excessive autophagy response is harmful and can stimulate a type II autophagic cell death. Despite the existence of a close relationship between calorie deprivation and autophagic response in different cell types, the precise molecular mechanisms associated with this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we aimed to highlight the possible effects of prolonged and short-term calorie restriction on autophagic response and cell homeostasis.",

      "abstract": "As the incidence of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) increases, preventive approaches become more crucial. In this review, calorie restriction (CR) effects on human beings were evaluated, comparing the benefits and risks of different CR diets: classic CR vs. ketosis-inducing diets, including intermittent fasting (IF), classic ketogenic diet (CKD), fasting mimicking diet (FMD), very-low-calorie ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet (SKMD). Special emphasis on insulin resistance (IR) was placed, as it mediates metabolic syndrome (MS), a known risk factor for CNCD, and is predictive of MS diagnosis. CR is the most robust intervention known to increase lifespan and health span, with high evidence and known biochemical mechanisms. CR improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, boosts exercise insulin sensitivity response, and there may be benefits of implementing moderate CR on healthy young and middle-aged individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence to support long-term CR. CKD is effective for weight and MS management, and may have additional benefits such as prevention of muscle loss and appetite control. SKMD has extreme significance benefits for all the metabolic parameters studied. Studies show inconsistent benefits of IF compared to classic CR. More studies are required to study biochemical parameters, reinforce evidence, identify risks, and seek effective and safe nutritional CR approaches.",

      "title": "Nutritional management of heart failure.",
      "abstract": "Nutrition in the cardiovascular field to date has focused on improving lifestyle-related diseases such as hypertension and diabetes from the viewpoint of secondary prevention. For these conditions, \"nutrition for weight loss\" is recommended, and nutritional guidance that restricts calories is provided. On the other hand, in symptomatic Stage C and D heart failure, it is known that underweight patients who manifest poor nutrition, sarcopenia, and cardiac cachexia have a poor prognosis. This is referred to as the \"Obesity paradox\". In order to \"avoid weight loss\" in patients with heart failure, a paradigm shift to nutritional management to prevent weight loss is needed. Rather than prescribing uniform recommendation for salt reduction of 6 g/day or less, awareness of the behavior change stage model is attracting attention. In this setting, the value of salt restriction will need to be determined to determine the priority level of intervention for undernutrition versus the need to prevent congestive signs and symptoms. In the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)/Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) for acute heart failure, nutritional intervention should be considered within 48 h of admission. Key points are selection of access route, timing of intervention, and monitoring of side effects. In nutritional management at home and in end-of-life care, food is a reflection of an individual's values, as well as a source of joy and encouragement. The importance of digestive tract should also be recognized in heart failure from oral flail to intestinal edema, constipation, and the intestinal bacteria called the heart-gut axis. Finally, we would like to propose a new term \"heart nutrition\" for nutritional management in patients with heart failure in this review. Compared to the evidence for exercise therapy in heart failure, studies assessing nutritional management remain scarce and there is a need for research in this area in the future.",

      "title": "Neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting, calorie restriction and exercise: a review and annotated bibliography.",
      "abstract": "In the last decades, important progress has been achieved in the understanding of the neurotrophic effects of intermittent fasting (IF), calorie restriction (CR) and exercise. Improved neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis (NSPAN) are essential examples of these neurotrophic effects. The importance in this respect of the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone bodies as cellular fuel has been highlighted. More recently, calorie restriction mimetics (CRMs; resveratrol and other polyphenols in particular) have been investigated thoroughly in relation to NSPAN. In the narrative review sections of this manuscript, recent findings on these essential functions are synthesized and the most important molecules involved are presented. The most researched signaling pathways (PI3K, Akt, mTOR, AMPK, GSK3β, ULK, MAPK, PGC-1α, NF-κB, sirtuins, Notch, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt) and processes (e.g., anti-inflammation, autophagy, apoptosis) that support or thwart neuroprotection, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis are then briefly presented. This provides an accessible entry point to the literature. In the annotated bibliography section of this contribution, brief summaries are provided of about 30 literature reviews relating to the neurotrophic effects of interest in relation to IF, CR, CRMs and exercise. Most of the selected reviews address these essential functions from the perspective of healthier aging (sometimes discussing epigenetic factors) and the reduction of the risk for neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease) and depression or the improvement of cognitive function.",

      "abstract": "Morning loaded calorie intake in humans has been advocated as a dietary strategy to improve weight loss. This is also supported by animal studies suggesting time of eating can prevent weight gain. However, the underlying mechanisms through which timing of eating could promote weight loss in humans are unclear. In a randomized crossover trial (NCT03305237), 30 subjects with obesity/overweight underwent two 4-week calorie-restricted but isoenergetic weight loss diets, with morning loaded or evening loaded calories (45%:35%:20% versus 20%:35%:45% calories at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, respectively). We demonstrate no differences in total daily energy expenditure or resting metabolic rate related to the timing of calorie distribution, and no difference in weight loss. Participants consuming the morning loaded diet reported significantly lower hunger. Thus, morning loaded intake (big breakfast) may assist with compliance to weight loss regime through a greater suppression of appetite.",

Dietary intervention is fundamental and essential as the first-line treatment for obese patients, and the main rule of every dietary modification is calorie restriction and consequent weight loss. Intermittent energy restriction (IER) is a special type of diet consisting of intermittent pauses in eating. There are many variations of IER diets such as alternate-day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF). In the literature, the IER diet is known as an effective method for bodyweight reduction. Furthermore, IER diets have a beneficial effect on systolic or diastolic pressure, lipid profile, and glucose homeostasis. In addition, IER diets are presented as being as efficient as a continuous energy restriction diet (CER) in losing weight and improving metabolic parameters. Thus, the IER diet could present an alternative option for those who cannot accept a constant food regimen.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this secondary analysis is to compare the effects of two popular weight loss regimens, time-restricted eating (TRE) and daily calorie restriction (CR), on mood and quality-of-life measures in adults with obesity. Ninety participants were randomized to one of three interventions for 12 months: 8 h TRE (eating only between 12:00 and 8:00 p.m., with no calorie counting); CR (25% energy restriction daily); or no-intervention control group. Questionnaires were administered to measure mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Profile of Mood States (POMS)) and quality of life (Rand 36-Item Short Form) at baseline and month 12. Body weight decreased in the TRE group (-4.87%, 95%CI: -7.61, -2.13) and CR group (-5.30%, 95%CI: -9.06, -1.54) versus controls, with no difference between TRE and CR. The BDI-II depression score did not change in the TRE or CR group, versus controls, by month 12. Likewise, there were no changes in any of the POMS subscales (tension, depression, anger, fatigue, anger, confusion, or vigor) or the total mood disturbance score in the TRE or CR group versus controls. As for quality of life, there were no significant changes in the SF-36 constructs of mental health, bodily pain, and general physical health in the TRE or CR group versus controls. However, there was a trend towards increased vitality in the TRE group (7.77 [95% CI: 0.15, 15.39] ",

      "title": "Clinical Outcomes of Refeeding Syndrome: A Systematic Review of High vs. Low-Calorie Diets for the Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders in Children and Adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Over the years, the standard of care for re-alimentation of patients admitted for the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) has been a conservative or cautious approach described as \"start low and go slow.\" These traditional refeeding protocols advocate for a low-calorie diet that restricts carbohydrates, with the primary goal of hypothetically lowering the risk of refeeding syndrome (RFS) and its complication. However, no consensus exists for the optimal inpatient approach to refeeding children and adolescents with AN. There is still some disagreement about what constitutes an ideal pace for nutritional rehabilitation. Varying treatment protocols have emerged across the globe, often reflecting the preferences and biases of individual practitioners and contributing to the lack of a universally accepted protocol for refeeding in AN. Although it is widely accepted that low-caloric refeeding (LCR) is safe for inpatient treatment of AN, this strategy has been shown to have several significant drawbacks, leading to increased criticism of the LCR method. Research from the last decade has led to calls for a more aggressive refeeding protocol, one that suggests a higher caloric intake from the offset. As a result, this research aimed to conduct a systematic review of the existing literature on strategies for refeeding hospitalized pediatric/adolescent patients with AN and related eating disorders. We aimed to compare high-caloric refeeding (HCR) and LCR in terms of weight gain, length of stay, and risk of RFS. We conducted a thorough search of medical databases for abstracts published in English, including Google Scholar, PubMed, and MEDLINE, to find relevant studies published between 2010 and February 2023. Our focus was on articles that evaluated high versus low refeeding protocols in children and adolescents hospitalized for treating AN and related eating disorders. Only articles that reported on at least one of the outcome variables of interest, such as hypophosphatemia, weight gain, RFS, or length of hospital stay, were considered. This review included 20 full-text articles published in the last decade on the HCR protocol in children and adolescents, with a total sample size of 2191 participants. In only one of the 20 studies did researchers find evidence of a true clinical case of RFS. We, therefore, found no evidence that HCR increased the risk of RFS in adolescents, even in those with a very low body mass index (BMI). However, evidence suggests a lower BMI at the time of hospital admission is a better predictor of hypophosphatemia than total caloric intake. In conclusion, based on the evidence from this review, a high-caloric diet or rapid refeeding in children/adolescents suffering from AN may be both safe and effective, with serial laboratory investigations and phosphate supplementation as needed. Hence, more research, particularly, randomized controlled trials, is required to help shape an evidence-based refeeding guideline outlining target calorie intakes and rates of advancement to assist clinicians in the treatment of adolescents with AN and related eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "The interest in intermittent energy restriction (IER) diets as a weight-loss approach is increasing. Different IER protocols exist, including time-restricted eating (TRE), alternate-day fasting (ADF), and the 5:2 diet. This meta-analysis compared the effects of these IER diets with continuous energy restriction (CER) on anthropometrics and cardiometabolic risk markers in healthy adults. Twenty-eight trials were identified that studied TRE (k = 7), ADF (k = 10), or the 5:2 diet (k = 11) for 2-52 wk. Energy intakes between intervention groups within a study were comparable (17 trials), lower in IER (5 trials), or not reported (6 trials). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. Changes in body weight [WMD: -0.42 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.96 to 0.13; P = 0.132] and fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.31 kg; 95% CI: -0.98 to 0.36; P = 0.362) were comparable when results of the 3 IER diets were combined and compared with those of CER. All IER diets combined reduced fat-free mass (WMD: -0.20 kg; 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.01; P = 0.044) and waist circumference (WMD: -0.91 cm; 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.06; P = 0.036) more than CER.

We placed 14-month-old female mice on five different dietary regimens, either CR or TRF with different feeding windows, and determined the effects of these regimens on physiological responses, progression of neoplasms and inflammatory diseases, serum metabolite levels, and lifespan. Compared with TRF feeding, CR elicited a robust systemic response, as it relates to energetics and healthspan metrics, a unique serum metabolomics signature in overnight fasted animals, and was associated with an increase in lifespan. These results indicate that daytime (rest-phase) feeding with prolonged fasting periods initiated late in life confer greater benefits when combined with imposed lower energy intake.",

With the growing popularity of various dietary strategies, evidence suggests that combining exercise with dietary interventions offers greater benefits than either approach alone. Consequently, this combined strategy has become a preferred method for many individuals aiming to maintain health. Calorie restriction, 5/2 intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, and the ketogenic diet are among the most popular dietary interventions today. Aerobic exercise, resistance training, and mixed exercise are the most widely practiced forms of physical activity. Exploring the best combinations of these approaches to determine which yields the most effective results is both meaningful and valuable. Despite this trend, a comparative analysis of the effects of different exercise and diet combinations is lacking. This study uses network meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of various combined interventions on body composition and to compare their efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Through shared pathophysiologic mechanisms, obesity exacerbates the age-related decline in physical function, which leads to frailty and disability. Obesity and aging are characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation, which contributes to reduced muscle quality and protein control mechanisms as well as to diminished muscle anabolic response. Obesity causes oxidative stress and inflammation, which increases telomere shortening. Calorie excess increases ROS formation, which damages nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria and promotes cellular senescence. Given the persistence of DNA damage associated with altered DNA repair proteins in obesity and aging, it is thought that inability to repair DNA may be the principal molecular event that underlies accelerated aging. Calorie restriction in combination with exercise slows biological aging by protecting against the molecular and cellular damages that occur in obesity and aging. Promising approaches such as Time Restricted Eating, Mediterranean Diet, and Senolytics need further investigation.",

      "title": "Dietary Restraint Fallacy.",
      "abstract": "For decades, the prevailing assumption in the field of eating disorders has been that dietary restraint causes weight gain and eating disorder symptoms, like binge eating. This belief resulted in widespread recommendations to reduce dietary restraint in treatments of eating disorders and obesity. However, recent findings by Grilo and Pittman (2024; International Journal of Eating Disorders) contradict this view, showing reduced binge frequency and greater weight loss with increased rigid dietary restraint. This commentary critically evaluates the evidence supporting a causal link between dietary restraint and overeating, highlighting the limitations of longitudinal and observational studies and the misinterpretations of early laboratory research. Importantly, randomized controlled trials and experiments that directly manipulate calorie intake show that calorie restriction improves eating control and reduces eating disorder symptoms. Conceptual issues are discussed; self-reported dietary restraint is not an accurate reflection of actual calorie restriction. It is argued that cognitive processes like learned food cue reactivity, weak executive skills and increased reward sensitivity can explain tendencies to overeat. They are usually followed by attempts to restrain food intake-essentially reverse causality. It is further hypothesized that the eating of healthy whole foods while avoiding unhealthy ultra-processed foods, could benefit both the prevention and treatment of all eating and weight disorders.",

      "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR), referred to as a reduction in dietary calorie intake without malnutrition, has been demonstrated to be a safe way to extend longevity of yeast, worms, and laboratory animals, and to decrease the risk factors in age-related diseases including cancer in humans. Pre-clinical studies in animal models demonstrated that CR may enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy during breast cancer treatment. Reduced calorie intake ameliorates risk factors and delays the onset of cancer by altering metabolism and fostering health-enhancing characteristics including increased autophagy and insulin sensitivity, and decreased blood glucose levels, inflammation, angiogenesis, and growth factor signaling. CR is not a common protocol implemented by medical practitioners to the general public due to the lack of substantial clinical studies. Future research and clinical trials are urgently needed to understand fully the biochemical basis of CR or CR mimetics to support its benefits. Here, we present a mini-review of research studies integrating CR as an adjuvant to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy during breast cancer treatment.",

      "abstract": "The risk of malignant tumor development is increasing in the world. Obesity is an established risk factor for various malignancies. There are many metabolic alterations associated with obesity which promote cancerogenesis. Excessive body weight leads to increased levels of estrogens, chronic inflammation and hypoxia, which can play an important role in the development of malignancies. It is proved that calorie restriction can improve the state of patients with various diseases. Decreased calorie uptake influences lipid, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, hormone levels and cell processes. Many investigations have been devoted to the effects of calorie restriction on cancer development in vitro and in vivo. It was revealed that fasting can regulate the activity of the signal cascades including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p53, mTOR, insulin/ insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and JAK-STAT. Up- or down-regulation of the pathways results in the decrease of cancer cell proliferation, migration and survival and the increase of apoptosis and effects of chemotherapy. The aim of this review is to discuss the connection between obesity and cancer development and the mechanisms of calorie restriction influence on cancerogenesis that stress the importance of further research of calorie restriction effects for the inclusion of this approach in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Satiety Associated with Calorie Restriction and Time-Restricted Feeding: Peripheral Hormones.",
      "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) is a common approach to inducing negative energy balance. Recently, time-restricted feeding (TRF), which involves consuming food within specific time windows during a 24-h day, has become popular owing to its relative ease of practice and potential to aid in achieving and maintaining a negative energy balance. TRF can be implemented intentionally with CR, or TRF might induce CR simply because of the time restriction. This review focuses on summarizing our current knowledge on how TRF and continuous CR affect gut peptides that influence satiety. Based on peer-reviewed studies, in response to CR there is an increase in the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and a reduction in fasting leptin and insulin. There is likely a reduction in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), and cholecystokinin (CCK), albeit the evidence for this is weak. After TRF, unlike CR, fasting ghrelin decreased in some TRF studies, whereas it showed no change in several others. Further, a reduction in fasting leptin, insulin, and GLP-1 has been observed. In conclusion, when other determinants of food intake are held equal, the peripheral satiety systems appear to be somewhat similarly affected by CR and TRF with regard to leptin, insulin, and GLP-1. But unlike CR, TRF did not appear to robustly increase ghrelin, suggesting different influences on appetite with a potential decrease of hunger after TRF when compared with CR. However, there are several established and novel gut peptides that have not been measured within the context of CR and TRF, and studies that have evaluated effects of TRF are often short-term, with nonuniform study designs and highly varying temporal eating patterns. More evidence and studies addressing these aspects are needed to draw definitive conclusions.",

      "abstract": "Calorie restriction increases lifespan. Among the tissue-specific protective effects of calorie restriction, the impact on the gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. We report increased numbers of chromogranin A-positive (+), including orexigenic ghrelin+ cells, in the stomach of calorie-restricted mice. This effect was accompanied by increased Notch target Hes1 and Notch ligand Jag1 and was reversed by blocking Notch with DAPT, a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Primary cultures and genetically modified reporter mice show that increased endocrine cell abundance is due to altered Lgr5+ stem and Neurog3+ endocrine progenitor cell proliferation. Different from the intestine, calorie restriction decreased gastric Lgr5+ stem cells, while increasing a FOXO1/Neurog3+ subpopulation of endocrine progenitors in a Notch-dependent manner. Further, activation of FOXO1 was sufficient to promote endocrine cell differentiation independent of Notch. The Notch inhibitor PF-03084014 or ghrelin receptor antagonist GHRP-6 reversed the phenotypic effects of calorie restriction in mice. Tirzepatide additionally expanded ghrelin+ cells in mice. In summary, calorie restriction promotes Notch-dependent, FOXO1-regulated gastric endocrine cell differentiation.",

      "abstract": "The scientific evidence indicates that calorie restriction and intermittent fasting are among the appropriate strategies targeting factual causative factors of various inflammatory and lifestyle-related disorders. Periodontitis is a common oral inflammatory disease leading to bone loss that is associated with various systemic problems. Previous studies suggest that calorie restriction may dampen inflammation and concomitant tissue damage under inflammatory conditions, such as periodontal diseases in nonhuman primates. However, insufficient research has been carried out to assess the effects of a calorie-restricted diet on the initiation and progression of periodontal disease in humans. This review of the literature aims to describe the general concepts of calorie restriction, its clinical implications, and related therapeutic potential in controlling periodontal inflammation. The review shows that fasting regimen groups have shown lesser bone loss because of an increase in osteoprogenitor cells than non-fasting groups. Calorie restriction dampens the inflammatory response and reduces circulating inflammatory mediators like tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, matrix metalloproteinase-8, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and interleukin-1-beta in gingival crevicular fluid. However, the incorporation of this form of dietary intervention continues to be challenging in our current society, in which obesity is a major public concern. Calorie restriction and intermittent fasting can play a key role in the cost-effective resolution of periodontal inflammation as a primary prevention strategy for the management of chronic inflammatory diseases, including periodontal diseases.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed diseases, and despite the continuous efforts in searching for new and more effective treatments, its morbidity and mortality remain a significant health problem worldwide. Calorie restriction, a dietary manipulation that consists in a reduction of the calorie intake, is gaining attention as a potential adjuvant intervention for preventing and/or fighting cancer. Several forms of energy reduction intake, which includes caloric restriction tout-court, dietary restrictions, and intermittent fasting, are being explored for their ability to prevent or slow down cancer progression. Additionally, another anti-cancer approach being under investigation relies on the use of nutraceuticals known as \"Caloric Restriction Mimetics\" that can provide caloric restriction-mediated benefits without subjecting the patients to a strict diet. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies consistently show that diet modifiers reducing the calorie have impact on tumor microenvironment and cancer metabolism, resulting in reduced growth and progression of cancer. Preliminary clinical studies show that patients subjected to a reduced nutrient/energy intake experience improved outcomes from chemo- and radiotherapy while better tolerating the side effects. Here, we review the state of the art on the therapeutic potential of calorie restriction and of caloric restriction mimetics in preventing or retarding tumor development by modulating a subset of cellular processes. The most recent clinical progresses with caloric restriction mimetics in the clinical practice are also discussed.",

Following CR and TRF, the increase in hunger and reduction in satiety signals of the melanocortin system [neuropeptide Y (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)] appear similar between CR and TRF protocols, as do the dopaminergic responses in the mesocorticolimbic circuit. However, ghrelin and leptin signaling via the melanocortin system appears to improve energy balance signals and reduce hyperphagia following TRF, which has not been reported in CR. In addition to satiety systems, CR and TRF also influence circadian rhythms. CR influences the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) or the primary circadian clock as seen by increased clock gene expression. In contrast, TRF appears to affect both the SCN and the peripheral clocks, as seen by phasic changes in the non-SCN (potentially the elusive food entrainable oscillator) and metabolic clocks. The peripheral clocks are influenced by the primary circadian clock but are also entrained by food timing, sleep timing, and other lifestyle parameters, which can supersede the metabolic processes that are regulated by the primary circadian clock. Taken together, TRF influences hunger/satiety, energy balance systems, and circadian rhythms, suggesting a role for adherence to CR in the long run if implemented using the TRF approach. However, these suggestions are based on only a few studies, and future investigations that use standardized protocols for the evaluation of the effect of these diet patterns (time, duration, meal composition, sufficiently powered) are necessary to verify these preliminary observations.",

      "abstract": "The human diet and dietary patterns are closely linked to the health status. High-calorie Western-style diets have increasingly come under scrutiny as their caloric load and composition contribute to the development of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, cancer, obesity, and cardiovascular disorders. On the other hand, calorie-reduced and health-promoting diets have shown promising results in maintaining health and reducing disease burden throughout aging. More recently, pharmacological Caloric Restriction Mimetics (CRMs) have gained interest of the public and scientific community as promising candidates that mimic some of the myriad of effects induced by caloric restriction. Importantly, many of the CRM candidates activate autophagy, prolong life- and healthspan in model organisms and ameliorate diverse disease symptoms without the need to cut calories. Among others, glycolytic inhibitors (e.g., D-allulose, D-glucosamine), hydroxycitric acid, NAD",

A healthy dietary pattern rather than individual foods or nutrients is emphasized, and this is generally plant based with optional consumption of dairy, eggs, and meats within the suggested limits.

Here, we examine how ad libitum- and CR-fed mice respond to tests performed at various times and fasting durations and find that the effects of CR-insulin sensitivity, circulating metabolite levels, and mechanistic target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) activity-result from the specific temporal conditions chosen, with CR-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity observed only after a prolonged fast, and the observed differences in mTORC1 activity between ad libitum- and CR-fed mice dependent upon both fasting duration and the specific tissue examined.

      "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) and treatment with rapamycin (RM), an inhibitor of the mTORC1 growth-promoting signaling pathway, are known to slow aging and promote health from worms to humans. At the transcriptome and proteome levels, long-term CR and RM treatments have partially overlapping effects, while their impact on protein phosphorylation within cellular signaling pathways have not been compared. Here we measured the phosphoproteomes of soleus, tibialis anterior, triceps brachii and gastrocnemius muscles from adult (10 months) and 30-month-old (aged) mice receiving either a control, a calorie restricted or an RM containing diet from 15 months of age. We reproducibly detected and extensively analyzed a total of 6960 phosphosites, 1415 of which are not represented in standard repositories. We reveal the effect of these interventions on known mTORC1 pathway substrates, with CR displaying greater between-muscle variation than RM. Overall, CR and RM have largely consistent, but quantitatively distinct long-term effects on the phosphoproteome, mitigating age-related changes to different degrees. Our data expands the catalog of protein phosphorylation sites in the mouse, providing important information regarding their tissue-specificity, and revealing the impact of long-term nutrient-sensing pathway inhibition on mouse skeletal muscle.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting diets have become very popular in the past few years, as they can produce clinically significant weight loss. These diets can be defined, in the simplest of terms, as periods of fasting alternating with periods of eating. The most studied forms of intermittent fasting include: alternate day fasting (0-500 kcal per 'fast day' alternating with ad libitum intake on 'feast days'); the 5:2 diet (two fast days and five feast days per week) and time-restricted eating (only eating within a prescribed window of time each day). Despite the recent surge in the popularity of fasting, only a few studies have examined the health benefits of these diets in humans. The goal of this Review is to summarize these preliminary findings and give insights into the effects of intermittent fasting on body weight and risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases in humans. This Review also assesses the safety of these regimens, and offers some practical advice for how to incorporate intermittent fasting diets into everyday life. Recommendations for future research are also presented.",

All forms of fasting reviewed here-alternate-day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating (TRE)-produced mild to moderate weight loss (1-8% from baseline) and consistent reductions in energy intake (10-30% from baseline). These regimens may benefit cardiometabolic health by decreasing blood pressure, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels are also lowered, but findings are variable. Other health benefits, such as improved appetite regulation and favorable changes in the diversity of the gut microbiome, have also been demonstrated, but evidence for these effects is limited. Intermittent fasting is generally safe and does not result in energy level disturbances or increased disordered eating behaviors. In summary, intermittent fasting is a safe diet therapy that can produce clinically significant weight loss (>5%) and improve several markers of metabolic health in individuals with obesity.",

These benefits include extended longevity, weight loss, and counteracting various disease conditions. Such procedures positively influence the benefits of human tissue-specific microbiomes and minimize the consequences of organellar apoptosis.

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained increasing scientific and general attention. Most studied forms of IF include alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating (TRE). Several cardiometabolic effects of IF have been described in animal models and, to a lesser extent, in humans. This review analyzes the impact of IF on weight loss, glucose metabolism, blood pressure, and lipid profile in humans. A literature search was conducted in the Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Controlled observational or interventional studies in humans, published between January 2000 and June 2021, were included. Studies comparing IF versus religious fasting were not included. Most studies indicate that the different types of IF have significant benefits on body composition, inducing weight loss and reducing fat mass. Changes in cardiometabolic parameters show more divergent results. In general, a decrease in fasting glucose and insulin levels is observed, together with an improved lipid profile associated with cardiovascular risk. High heterogeneity in study designs was observed, particularly in studies with TRE, small sample sizes, and short-term interventions. Current evidence shows that IF confers a range of cardiometabolic benefits in humans. Weight loss, improvement of glucose homeostasis and lipid profile, are observed in the three types of IF protocols evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) modifies cell- and tissue-specific immunometabolic responses that dictate metabolic flexibility and inflammation during obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Fasting forces periods of metabolic flexibility and necessitates increased use of different substrates. IF can lower metabolic inflammation and improve glucose metabolism without lowering obesity and can influence time-dependent, compartmentalized changes in immunity. Liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and immune cells communicate to relay metabolic and immune signals during fasting. Here we review the connections between metabolic and immune cells to explain the divergent effects of IF compared with classic caloric restriction (CR) strategies. We also explore how the immunometabolism of metabolic diseases dictates certain IF outcomes, where the gut microbiota triggers changes in immunity and metabolism during fasting.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting has gained global popularity for its potential health benefits, although its impact on somatic stem cells and tissue biology remains elusive. Here, we report that commonly used intermittent fasting regimens inhibit hair follicle regeneration by selectively inducing apoptosis in activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). This effect is independent of calorie reduction, circadian rhythm alterations, or the mTORC1 cellular nutrient-sensing mechanism. Instead, fasting activates crosstalk between adrenal glands and dermal adipocytes in the skin, triggering the rapid release of free fatty acids into the niche, which in turn disrupts the normal metabolism of HFSCs and elevates their cellular reactive oxygen species levels, causing oxidative damage and apoptosis. A randomized clinical trial (NCT05800730) indicates that intermittent fasting inhibits human hair growth. Our study uncovers an inhibitory effect of intermittent fasting on tissue regeneration and identifies interorgan communication that eliminates activated HFSCs and halts tissue regeneration during periods of unstable nutrient supply.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes can potentially be prevented by targeted lifestyle and weight loss interventions. Time restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that has emerged as a novel diet strategy to reduce body weight and improve glycaemic control. TRE involves eating within a certain window of time (usually 4 to 10 h), and water-fasting for the remaining hours of the day. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effects of TRE on body weight and markers of glycaemic control in human subjects. We also aim to provide mechanistic insights into the effect of TRE on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Results to date reveal that TRE produces mild weight loss (1%-4% from baseline) and energy restriction, when food consumption is restricted to 4-10 h/day. TRE also reduces fasting insulin and improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with prediabetes and those with obesity. Moreover, TRE improves glucose tolerance and decreases serum glucose excursions. The possible mechanisms underlying these benefits include increased autophagic flux, mild elevations in ketone bodies, a reduction in oxidative stress, and the stimulation of β-cell responsiveness. While these preliminary results offer promise for the use of TRE in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, larger and longer-term human trials will be needed to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "The role and molecular mechanisms of intermittent fasting (IF) in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and its transition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are unknown. Here, we identified that an IF 5:2 regimen prevents NASH development as well as ameliorates established NASH and fibrosis without affecting total calorie intake. Furthermore, the IF 5:2 regimen blunted NASH-HCC transition when applied therapeutically. The timing, length, and number of fasting cycles as well as the type of NASH diet were critical parameters determining the benefits of fasting. Combined proteome, transcriptome, and metabolome analyses identified that peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and glucocorticoid-signaling-induced PCK1 act co-operatively as hepatic executors of the fasting response. In line with this, PPARα targets and PCK1 were reduced in human NASH. Notably, only fasting initiated during the active phase of mice robustly induced glucocorticoid signaling and free-fatty-acid-induced PPARα signaling. However, hepatocyte-specific glucocorticoid receptor deletion only partially abrogated the hepatic fasting response. In contrast, the combined knockdown of Ppara and Pck1 in vivo abolished the beneficial outcomes of fasting against inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, overexpression of Pck1 alone or together with Ppara in vivo lowered hepatic triglycerides and steatosis. Our data support the notion that the IF 5:2 regimen is a promising intervention against NASH and subsequent liver cancer.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) is an eating pattern in which individuals go extended periods with little or no energy intake after consuming regular food in intervening periods. IF has several health-promoting effects. It can effectively reduce weight, fasting insulin levels, and blood glucose levels. It can also increase the antitumor activity of medicines and cause improvement in the case of neurological diseases, such as memory deficit, to achieve enhanced metabolic function and prolonged longevity. Additionally, IF activates several biological pathways to induce autophagy, encourages cell renewal, prevents cancer cells from multiplying and spreading, and delays senescence. However, IF has specific adverse effects and limitations when it comes to people of a particular age and gender. Hence, a more systematic study on the health-promoting effects and safety of IF is needed. This article reviewed the research on the health-promoting effects of IF, providing a theoretical basis, direction for subsequent basic research, and information related to the clinical application of IF.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting, which includes periods of fasting and nutrition, has been considered a dietary approach for weight loss and metabolic health improvement. However, its potential benefits in autoimmune diseases have not been widely studied. This study aims to review the existing studies on the role and effects of intermittent fasting on autoimmune diseases. A comprehensive search was conducted on electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, and relevant studies were included based on inclusion criteria. Studies show that intermittent fasting may have beneficial effects on various autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, by reducing inflammatory markers, modulating the immune system, altering and improving gut microbiota, and enhancing cellular repair mechanisms through autophagy. However, evidence regarding the effects of intermittent fasting on other autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, thyroid diseases, and psoriasis is limited and inconclusive. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine optimal intermittent fasting guidelines and its long-term effects on autoimmune diseases. Overall, this literature review proves intermittent fasting may be a promising dietary intervention for managing autoimmune diseases.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular types of diet at the moment because it is an effective nutritional strategy in terms of weight loss. The main objective of this review is to analyze the effects that intermittent fasting has on sports performance. We analyzed physical capacities: aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, strength, and power, as well as their effect on body composition. For this, a bibliographic search was carried out in several databases where 25 research articles were analyzed to clarify these objectives. Inclusion criteria: dates between 2013 and present, free full texts, studies conducted in adult human athletes, English and/or Spanish languages, and if it has been considered that intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in terms of performance or physical capacities. This review was registered in PROSPERO with code ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias was performed. After this analysis, results were obtained regarding the improvement of body composition and the maintenance of muscle mass. An influence of intermittent fasting on sports performance and body composition is observed. It can be concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power. But despite this, it is necessary to carry out new studies focusing on the sports field since the samples have been very varied. Additionally, the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied, especially in the case of overnight fasting.",

      "title": "Effect of Intermittent Fasting on Reproductive Hormone Levels in Females and Males: A Review of Human Trials.",
      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is a popular diet for weight loss, but concerns have been raised regarding the effects of fasting on the reproductive health of women and men. Accordingly, we conducted this literature review to clarify the effects of fasting on reproductive hormone levels in humans. Our results suggest that intermittent fasting decreases androgen markers (i.e., testosterone and the free androgen index (FAI)) while increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in premenopausal females with obesity. This effect was more likely to occur when food consumption was confined to earlier in the day (eating all food before 4 pm). In contrast, fasting did not have any effect on estrogen, gonadotropins, or prolactin levels in women. As for men, intermittent fasting reduced testosterone levels in lean, physically active, young males, but it did not affect SHBG concentrations. Interestingly, muscle mass and muscular strength were not negatively affected by these reductions in testosterone. In interpreting these findings, it is important to note that very few studies have been conducted on this topic. Thus, it is difficult to draw solid conclusions at present. From the limited data presented here, it is possible that intermittent fasting may decrease androgen markers in both genders. If this is the case, these results would have varied health implications. On the one hand, fasting may prove to be a valuable tool for treating hyperandrogenism in females with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) by improving menstruation and fertility. On the other hand, fasting may be shown to decrease androgens among males, which could negatively affect metabolic health and libido. More research is warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.",

In both animals and humans, TRF has pleiotropic health benefits that arise from multiple organ systems, yet the molecular basis of TRF-mediated benefits is not well understood. Here, we subjected mice to isocaloric ad libitum feeding (ALF) or TRF of a western diet and examined gene expression changes in samples taken from 22 organs and brain regions collected every 2 h over a 24-h period. We discovered that TRF profoundly impacts gene expression. Nearly 80% of all genes show differential expression or rhythmicity under TRF in at least one tissue. Functional annotation of these changes revealed tissue- and pathway-specific impacts of TRF. These findings and resources provide a critical foundation for future mechanistic studies and will help to guide human time-restricted eating (TRE) interventions to treat various disease conditions with or without pharmacotherapies.",

One suggestion is that intermittent fasting attenuates an increase in appetite that typically accompanies weight loss. Here, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effects of intermittent fasting on appetite, when compared to a continuous energy restriction intervention. Five electronic databases and trial registers were searched in February 2021 and February 2022. Abstracts (N = 2800) were screened and 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), consisting of a variety of intermittent fasting regimes, met our inclusion criteria. The total number of participants allocated to interventions was 1111 and all RCTs were judged as having either some concerns or a high risk of bias (Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on change-from-baseline appetite ratings. There was no clear evidence that intermittent fasting affected hunger (WMD = -3.03; 95% CI [-8.13, 2.08]; ",

While nutrition and health are closely intertwined, our limited understanding of how diet precisely influences disease often precludes the medical use of specific dietary interventions. Caloric restriction (CR) has approached clinical application as a powerful, yet simple, dietary modulation that extends both life- and healthspan in model organisms and ameliorates various diseases. However, due to psychological and social-behavioral limitations, CR may be challenging to implement into real life. Thus, CR-mimicking interventions have been developed, including intermittent fasting, time-restricted eating, and macronutrient modulation. Nonetheless, possible side effects of CR and alternatives thereof must be carefully considered. We summarize key concepts and differences in these dietary interventions in humans, discuss their molecular effects, and shed light on advantages and disadvantages.",

      "title": "Timing of energy intake and the therapeutic potential of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in NAFLD.",
      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a major public health concern and is associated with a substantial global burden of liver-related and cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. High total energy intake coupled with unhealthy consumption of ultra-processed foods and saturated fats have long been regarded as major dietary drivers of NAFLD. However, there is an accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that the timing of energy intake across a the day is also an important determinant of individual risk for NAFLD and associated metabolic conditions. This review summarises the available observational and epidemiological data describing associations between eating patterns and metabolic disease, including the negative effects of irregular meal patterns, skipping breakfast and night-time eating on liver health. We suggest that that these harmful behaviours deserve greater consideration in the risk stratification and management of patients with NAFLD particularly in a 24-hour society with continuous availability of food and with up to 20% of the population now engaged in shiftwork with mistimed eating patterns. We also draw on studies reporting the liver-specific impact of Ramadan, which represents a unique real-world opportunity to explore the physiological impact of fasting. By highlighting data from preclinical and pilot human studies, we present a further biological rationale for manipulating timing of energy intake to improve metabolic health and discuss how this may be mediated through restoration of natural circadian rhythms. Lastly, we comprehensively review the landscape of human trials of intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating in metabolic disease and offer a look to the future about how these dietary strategies may benefit patients with NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",

      "abstract": "Obesity often results in severe negative health consequences and represents a growing issue for global health. Reducing food intake is a crucial factor for weight loss. Intermittent fasting is a relatively new intervention that contributes to weight reduction. Considering the intimate relationship between obesity and inflammatory pathologies with gut microbiota alterations, a systematic review of the literature was herein conducted to elucidate the relationship between time-restricted food intake and gut microbiota diversity in humans. Searches are carried out in three databases (PubMed, MedLine/OVID, and Academic Search Complete) between April 2019 and April 2022. Nine studies (all with longitudinal design) were identified as eligible by presenting data about the impact of intermittent fasting schemes on gut microbiota. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increase throughout follow-ups, while 16 bacteria genera change their abundance in response to intermittent fasting. Finally, some genera associated with clinical predictors such as weight change, abdominal circumference, and metabolic variables were reported. Changes induced by fasting schemes positively impact the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota and the biomarkers described here. However, the changes previously reported have been studied in short periods and some return to their basal state after fasting intervention.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this secondary analysis is to compare the effects of two popular weight loss regimens, time-restricted eating (TRE) and daily calorie restriction (CR), on mood and quality-of-life measures in adults with obesity. Ninety participants were randomized to one of three interventions for 12 months: 8 h TRE (eating only between 12:00 and 8:00 p.m., with no calorie counting); CR (25% energy restriction daily); or no-intervention control group. Questionnaires were administered to measure mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and Profile of Mood States (POMS)) and quality of life (Rand 36-Item Short Form) at baseline and month 12. Body weight decreased in the TRE group (-4.87%, 95%CI: -7.61, -2.13) and CR group (-5.30%, 95%CI: -9.06, -1.54) versus controls, with no difference between TRE and CR. The BDI-II depression score did not change in the TRE or CR group, versus controls, by month 12. Likewise, there were no changes in any of the POMS subscales (tension, depression, anger, fatigue, anger, confusion, or vigor) or the total mood disturbance score in the TRE or CR group versus controls. As for quality of life, there were no significant changes in the SF-36 constructs of mental health, bodily pain, and general physical health in the TRE or CR group versus controls. However, there was a trend towards increased vitality in the TRE group (7.77 [95% CI: 0.15, 15.39] ",

In an 8-week randomized clinical trial involving 40 cognitively intact older adults with insulin resistance, we examined the effects of 5:2 intermittent fasting and the healthy living diet on brain health. Although intermittent fasting induced greater weight loss, the two diets had comparable effects in improving insulin signaling biomarkers in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles, decreasing the brain-age-gap estimate (reflecting the pace of biological aging of the brain) on magnetic resonance imaging, reducing brain glucose on magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and improving blood biomarkers of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, with minimal changes in cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease. Intermittent fasting and healthy living improved executive function and memory, with intermittent fasting benefiting more certain cognitive measures. In exploratory analyses, sex, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E and SLC16A7 genotypes modulated diet effects. The study provides a blueprint for assessing brain effects of dietary interventions and motivates further research on intermittent fasting and continuous diets for brain health optimization.

      "abstract": "Almost 40% of the adult population in the USA will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Diet is a modifiable factor which is known to affect cancer risk and recurrence. Yet, little is known about how diet influences cancer treatment outcomes. Intermittent fasting, characterized by periods of abstaining from foods and beverages alternated with periods of ad libitum intake, when adopted in the context of chemotherapy, has shown promise in preclinical models resulting in decreased vomiting, diarrhea, visible discomfort, and improved insulin sensitivity and efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment. Although intermittent fasting during receipt of chemotherapy has been well-established in preclinical models, limited numbers of human studies are now being reported. This review aims to survey the current data examining the effect of intermittent fasting on chemotherapy efficacy, patient treatment outcomes, patient centered outcomes, and circulating biomarkers associated with cancer. Available data show that periodic fasting, a form of intermittent fasting, may hold potential to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy, decrease treatment-related side effects and cancer-promoting factors such as insulin, while ameliorating treatment-related decreases in quality of life and daily functioning. Larger controlled periodic fasting trials, including exploration of alternate forms of intermittent fasting, are needed to better elucidate the effect of intermittent fasting on treatment and patient outcomes during chemotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a significant public health concern globally. Weight managementis crucial in controlling MetS risk factors, making energy balance and weight loss strategies important in nutrition recommendations. Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained traction as a dietary approach for weight management and cardiovascular risk reduction. However, the effects of IF on cardiovascular risk factors have been inconsistent in previous studies. This review aims to summarize the effects of various types of IF on body mass index (BMI), glycemia, lipid profile, and blood pressure, while providing insights into their clinical implications. A comprehensive search of interventional studies and meta-analyses was conducted, and the results were analyzed. The findings indicate that different types of IF lead to mixed effects. Time-restricted eating (TRE) and alternate-day fasting (ADF) consistently showed decreases in BMI, while the outcomes of intermittent energy restriction (IER) were more uncertain. The effects of IF on glycemia and lipid profile were also variable, with TRE and ADF generally showing positive results. However, the impact of IER remained inconsistent. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects and optimal implementation of IF for managing metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors.",

We placed 14-month-old female mice on five different dietary regimens, either CR or TRF with different feeding windows, and determined the effects of these regimens on physiological responses, progression of neoplasms and inflammatory diseases, serum metabolite levels, and lifespan. Compared with TRF feeding, CR elicited a robust systemic response, as it relates to energetics and healthspan metrics, a unique serum metabolomics signature in overnight fasted animals, and was associated with an increase in lifespan. These results indicate that daytime (rest-phase) feeding with prolonged fasting periods initiated late in life confer greater benefits when combined with imposed lower energy intake.",

      "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is a dietary pattern characterized by alternating periods of total or partial fasting and ad libitum food consumption. During prolonged fasting, the body uses the ketone bodies formed from lipolysis of body fat, which also leads to some metabolic modifications with positive effects on health. In this sense, nocturnal intermittent fasting could contribute to properly synchronize the circadian system making the physiological, hormonal, energetic and metabolic processes work correctly and keeping to the individual in homeostasis. Thus, according to the results of different studies, intermittent fasting, in the short-medium term, seems to improve body composition, as well as the values of several cardiometabolic parameters such as insulin and HOMA-IR index, among others. These effects have been observed in both pre- and postmenopausal women (no differences have been found between both states) and are similar to those found in interventions with caloric restriction diets.",

      "abstract": "Studies have found that intermittent fasting (IF) can prevent diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and neuropathy, while in humans it has helped to alleviate metabolic syndrome, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and many other disorders. IF involves a series of coordinated metabolic and hormonal changes to maintain the organism's metabolic balance and cellular homeostasis. More importantly, IF can activate hepatic autophagy, which is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and energy balance, quality control, cell and tissue remodeling, and defense against extracellular damage and pathogens. IF affects hepatic autophagy through multiple interacting pathways and molecular mechanisms, including adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), silent mating-type information regulatory 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1), peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), as well as signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms such as glucagon and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21). These pathways can stimulate the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), play a cytoprotective role, downregulate the expression of aging-related molecules, and prevent the development of steatosis-associated liver tumors. By influencing the metabolism of energy and oxygen radicals as well as cellular stress response systems, IF protects hepatocytes from genetic and environmental factors. By activating hepatic autophagy, IF has a potential role in treating a variety of liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A better understanding of the effects of IF on liver autophagy may lead to new approaches for the prevention and treatment of liver disease.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, intermittent fasting (IF) and its numerous modifications have been increasingly suggested as a promising therapy for age-related problems and a non-pharmacological strategy to extend lifespan. Despite the great variability in feeding schedules that we describe in the current work, underlying physiological processes are the same and include a periodic switch from glucose metabolism (generated by glycogenolysis) to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones. Many of the beneficial effects of IF appear to be mediated by optimization of energy utilization. Findings to date from both human and animal experiments indicate that fasting improves physiological function, enhances performance, and slows aging and disease processes. In this review, we discuss some of the remarkable discoveries about the beneficial effects of IF on metabolism, endocrine and cardiovascular systems, cancer prevention, brain health, neurodegeneration and aging. Experimental studies on rodent models and human investigations are summarized to compare the outcomes and underlying mechanisms of IF. Metabolic and cellular responses triggered by IF could help to achieve the aim of preventing disease, and maximizing healthspan and longevity with minimal side effects.",

      "abstract": "Population aging and the associated increase in cardiovascular disease rates pose serious threats to global public health. Different forms of fasting have become an increasingly attractive strategy to directly address aging and potentially limit or delay the onset of cardiovascular diseases. A growing number of experimental studies and clinical trials indicate that the amount and timing of food intake as well as the daily time window during which food is consumed, are crucial determinants of cardiovascular health. Indeed, intermittent fasting counteracts the molecular hallmarks of cardiovascular aging and promotes different aspects of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure and glycemic control, as well as body weight reduction. In this report, we summarize current evidence from randomized clinical trials of intermittent fasting on body weight and composition as well as cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Moreover, we critically discuss the preventive and therapeutic potential of intermittent fasting, but also possible detrimental effects in the context of cardiovascular aging and related disease. We delve into the physiological mechanisms through which intermittent fasting might improve cardiovascular health, and raise important factors to consider in the design of clinical trials on the efficacy of intermittent fasting to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events among aged individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. We conclude that despite growing evidence and interest among the lay and scientific communities in the cardiovascular health-improving effects of intermittent fasting, further research efforts and appropriate caution are warranted before broadly implementing intermittent fasting regimens, especially in elderly persons.",

We applied a systematic approach to scope published randomized controlled trials (databases: PubMed, CINAHL Plus, PsychInfo, Scopus, and Google Scholar) from inception through August 2023. The initial search provided 389 unique articles which were critically appraised. Thirty articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion: 12 were IF, 10 were CR, and 8 were combined IF and CR interventions. IF and CR were associated with weight loss; however, IF studies tended to report greater adherence compared with CR. Overall, IF and CR were equivalently effective across cardiometabolic, cancer, and neurocognitive outcomes. Our findings suggest that IF has health benefits in a variety of conditions and may be better accepted and tolerated than CR, but more comparative research is required.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: intermittent fasting plans propose to limit food intake during specific periods as nutritional therapeutic strategies to treat different metabolic conditions in various clinical entities. However, the heterogeneity between each context of intermittent fasting could generate different results in metabolic parameters. Objective: to evaluate the clinical application of intermittent fasting and to discern whether it offers advantages over other traditional strategies. Methods: structured questions were formulated (PICO), and the methodology followed the guidelines established by the PRISMA 2020 statement. The search was conducted in different databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar). Results: we found 3,962 articles, of which 56 were finally included; 3,906 articles that did not directly or indirectly answer the structured questions were excluded. Conclusions: compared to conventional diets, the various AI schemes do not generate advantages or disadvantages in terms of weight loss and lipid profile, although in the alternate-day variant there are greater insulin reductions than those observed in the continuous energy restriction. The heterogeneity of the interventions, the populations studied, the comparators, the results, and the type of design make it impossible to extrapolate the effects found in all clinical scenarios and generalize the recommendations.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most-frequent malignancy amongst women, whereas obesity and excess caloric consumption increase the risk for developing the disease. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) on previously diagnosed BC patients, regarding quality of life (QoL) scores during chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced toxicity, radiological response and BC recurrence, endocrine-related outcomes, as well as IF-induced adverse effects in these populations. A comprehensive search was conducted between 31 December 2010 and 31 October 2022, using the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Two investigators independently performed abstract screenings, full-text screenings, and data extraction, and the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was used to evaluate the quality of the selected studies. We screened 468 papers, 10 of which were selected for data synthesis. All patients were female adults whose age ranged between 27 and 78 years. Participants in all studies were women diagnosed with BC of one of the following stages: I, II (HER2-/+), III (HER2-/+), IV, LUMINAL-A, LUMINAL-B (HER2-/+). Notably, IF during chemotherapy was found to be feasible, safe and able to relieve chemotherapy-induced adverse effects and cytotoxicity. IF seemed to improve QoL during chemotherapy, through the reduction of fatigue, nausea and headaches, however data were characterized as low quality. IF was found to reduce chemotherapy-induced DNA damage and augmented optimal glycemic regulation, improving serum glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 concentrations. A remarkable heterogeneity of duration of dietary patterns was observed among available studies. In conclusion, we failed to identify any IF-related beneficial effects on the QoL, response after chemotherapy or related symptoms, as well as measures of tumor recurrence in BC patients. We identified a potential beneficial effect of IF on chemotherapy-induced toxicity, based on markers of DNA and leukocyte damage; however, these results were derived from three studies and require further validation. Further studies with appropriate design and larger sample sizes are warranted to elucidate its potential standard incorporation in daily clinical practice.",
