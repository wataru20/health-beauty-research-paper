      "title": "Functional Food in Relation to Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).",
      "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common esophageal disorder characterized by troublesome symptoms associated with increased esophageal acid exposure. The cornerstones of therapy in this regard include treatment with acid-suppressive agents, lifestyle modifications, and dietary therapy, although the latter has not been well defined. As concerns regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use continue to be explored, patients and healthcare providers are becoming increasingly interested in the role of diet in disease management. However, dietary interventions lack evidence of the synthesis effect of functional foods. The following is a review of dietary therapy for GERD, emphasizing food components' impact on GERD pathophysiology and management. Although the sequential dietary elimination of food groups is a common practice, the literature supports broader intervention, including reduced overall sugar intake, increased dietary fiber, and changes in overall eating practices. While the primary concern of food companies is to provide safe products, the caloric, nutritional, and functional composition of foods is also generating interest in the food industry due to consumers' concerns.",

      "title": "Postbiotics in Human Health: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "In the 21st century, compressive health and functional foods are advocated by increasingly more people in order to eliminate sub-health conditions. Probiotics and postbiotics have gradually become the focus of scientific and nutrition communities. With the maturity and wide application of probiotics, the safety concerns and other disadvantages are non-negligible as we review here. As new-era products, postbiotics continue to have considerable potential as well as plentiful drawbacks to optimize. \"Postbiotic\" has been defined as a \"preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host\". Here, the evolution of the concept \"postbiotics\" is reviewed. The underlying mechanisms of postbiotic action are discussed. Current insight suggests that postbiotics exert efficacy through protective modulation, fortifying the epithelial barrier and modulation of immune responses. Finally, we provide an overview of the comparative advantages and the current application in the food industry at pharmaceutical and biomedical levels.",

      "abstract": "A growing demand exists for nutraceuticals, which seem to reside in the grey area between pharmaceuticals and food. Nutraceuticals, up today, do not have a specific definition distinct from those of other food-derived categories, e.g., food supplements, herbal products, functional foods, and fortified foods. They have, however, a pharmacological beneficial effect on health. Many studies have been recently addressed to assess their safety, efficacy, and regulation. The object of writing this review article is that we need to pay more attention to natural and organic foods. The bases of nutraceutical components (food supplements) are known for potent and powerful clinical evidence effects on the treatment of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Food carbohydrates are macronutrients that are found in fruits, grains, vegetables, and milk products. These organic compounds are present in foods in the form of sugars, starches, and fibers and are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. These wide ranging macromolecules can be classified according to their chemical structure into three major groups: low molecular weight mono- and disaccharides, intermediate molecular weight oligosaccharides, and high molecular weight polysaccharides. Notably, the digestibility of specific carbohydrate components differ and nondigestible carbohydrates can reach the large intestine intact where they act as food sources for beneficial bacteria. In this review, we give an overview of advances made in food carbohydrate analysis. Overall, this review indicates the importance of carbohydrate analytical techniques in the quest to identify and isolate health-promoting carbohydrates to be used as additives in the functional foods industry.",

      "abstract": "The immune system comprises a complex group of processes that provide defense against diverse pathogens. These defenses can be divided into innate and adaptive immunity, in which specific immune components converge to limit infections. In addition to genetic factors, aging, lifestyle, and environmental factors can influence immune function, potentially affecting the susceptibility of the host to disease-causing agents. Chemical compounds in certain foods have been shown to regulate signal transduction and cell phenotypes, ultimately impacting pathophysiology. Research has shown that the consumption of specific functional foods can stimulate the activity of immune cells, providing protection against cancer, viruses, and bacteria. Here, we review a number of functional foods reported to strengthen immunity, including ginseng, mushrooms, chlorella, and probiotics (Lactobacillus plantarum). We also discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating the activity of various types of immune cells. Identifying immune-enhancing functional foods and understanding their mechanisms of action will support new approaches to maintain proper health and combat immunological diseases.",

This work analyzes studies conducted to highlight the health properties of the most common ethnic foods. Although these foods were originally created from the need to preserve perishable produce, presently, we know that the fermentation process makes them nutritionally more complete. The basis of these transformations lies in that vast range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms that, similar to small biochemical factories, can transform the initial nutrients into metabolically more active biomolecules through fermentation. Although naturally occurring microbes work together for mutual benefit, environmental conditions enhance or inhibit their development. Starting from a selection of microorganisms naturally present on a substrate, we attempt to select the most suitable species to obtain a fermented food with the best nutritional qualities and the richest in nutraceuticals.",

The most common dietary sources of betaine are beets, spinach, and whole grains. Whole grains-such as quinoa, wheat and oat brans, brown rice, barley, etc.-are generally considered rich sources of betaine. This valuable compound has gained popularity as an ingredient in novel and functional foods due to the demonstrated health benefits that it may provide. This review study will provide an overview of the various natural sources of betaine, including different types of food products, and explore the potential of betaine as an innovative functional ingredient. It will thoroughly discuss its metabolic pathways and physiology, disease-preventing and health-promoting properties, and further highlight the extraction procedures and detection methods in different matrices. In addition, gaps in the existing scientific literature will be emphasized.",

      "title": "Trends and Technological Advancements in the Possible Food Applications of Spirulina and Their Health Benefits: A Review.",
      "abstract": "Spirulina is a kind of blue-green algae (BGA) that is multicellular, filamentous, and prokaryotic. It is also known as a cyanobacterium. It is classified within the phylum known as blue-green algae. Despite the fact that it includes a high concentration of nutrients, such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids-in particular, the necessary omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids-the percentage of total fat and cholesterol that can be found in these algae is substantially lower when compared to other food sources. This is the case even if the percentage of total fat that can be found in these algae is also significantly lower. In addition to this, spirulina has a high concentration of bioactive compounds, such as phenols, phycocyanin pigment, and polysaccharides, which all take part in a number of biological activities, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. As a result of this, spirulina has found its way into the formulation of a great number of medicinal foods, functional foods, and nutritional supplements. Therefore, this article makes an effort to shed light on spirulina, its nutritional value as a result of its chemical composition, and its applications to some food product formulations, such as dairy products, snacks, cookies, and pasta, that are necessary at an industrial level in the food industry all over the world. In addition, this article supports the idea of incorporating it into the food sector, both from a nutritional and health perspective, as it offers numerous advantages.",

A total of 47 articles were selected for this paper. The available studies from last 20 years differ according to the focus (awareness, attitudes, motivations, willingness, acceptance by consumers) and methodologies used. Several factors, including socio-demographic, cognitive and attitudinal ones, seem to be serve as the basis for the acceptance of functional products. The research papers showed that nutritional knowledge is the most important of these. Older people are more interested in functional products than younger consumers, because of their stronger belief in the health benefits of FF. Moreover, women are more open to compromise between taste and health properties. Claims concerning the disease preventative properties of FF are the most attractive for consumers. This review focuses also on future perspectives for the functional food market. Adequate knowledge and evidence-based communication seem to be the most promising ways to increase consumers' interest in these kinds of products.",

However, the active ingredients in functional foods are usually very low due to the instability and easy degradation of some nutrients. Therefore, improving the utilization rate of the effective ingredients in functional food has become the key problem. Nanomaterials have been widely used and studied in many fields due to their small size effect, high specific surface area, high target activity, and other characteristics. Therefore, it is a feasible method to process and modify functional food using nanotechnology. In this review, we summarize the nanoparticle delivery system and the food nanotechnology in the field of functional food. We also summarize and prospect the application, basic principle, and latest development of nano-functional food and put forward corresponding views.",

Mushrooms have provided food for millennia and production methods and species diversity have recently expanded. Beyond mushrooms, cultured fungal mycelia are now harvested as a primary product for food. Mushrooms and mycelia provide dietary protein, lipids and fatty acids, vitamins, fibre, and flavour, and can improve the organoleptic properties of processed foods (including meat analogues). Further, they are often key ingredients in nutritional or therapeutic supplements because of diverse specialised metabolites. Mycelia can also improve feed conversion efficiency, gut health, and wellbeing in livestock. New molecular tools, coupled with quality genetic data, are improving production technologies, enabling the synthesis of specialised metabolites, and creating new processing and valorisation opportunities.

Nowadays, microalgae are being incorporated into many food formulations. Most of these use microalgae as a marketing strategy or as a colouring agent. However, Spirulina (and compounds derived thereof) show potential for being used as ingredients in the development of novel functional foods, which are one of the top trends in the food industry. Several human intervention studies demonstrated the potential of Spirulina for being used in the prevention or treatment of disorders related to metabolic syndrome. The aim of the current paper was to review current and potential applications of this microalga in the food and functional food industries. Health benefits associated with consuming Spirulina and/or some of the most important compounds derived from Spirulina were also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the consumers' understanding of the relation between diet and health has bought a profound change in their dietary pattern and lifestyle transformation. They aspire more to natural and health-full food products with desired quality and functionality. The emergence of this consciousness among consumers has become one of the driving factors for designing food products that can meet both their specific nutritional needs and health benefits. Known as the skeleton structure of food, hydrocolloids from food biopolymers have thus received much attention in recent years from both scientific communities as well as from consumers and food sectors. They play a crucial role in the tribology, rheology and sensory perceptions of food and pharmaceutical formulations when been utilized as viscosity enhancers, gelling agents, emulsifiers, coating, and stabilizing agents. Further, the implication of this multifarious class of biopolymers has increased tremendously because of their remarkable therapeutic potential. Based on prevailing literature hydrocolloids offer significant opportunities in tailoring the nutritional value along with providing health benefits via controlling gastric emptying and ileal brake mechanism, lowering plasma cholesterol levels, glycemic response, postprandial glucose and insulin levels, and prevention of colon cancer, and improving the bioavailability of specific bioactive compounds and drugs through their controlled and targeted delivery along the gastrointestinal tract. This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the functionality and nutraceutical potential of food colloids as a functional food ingredient with a specific focus on their application as controlled release excipients for nutraceuticals or drug release systems.",

      "abstract": "This review was the first to gather literature about the effect of emerging technologies on probiotic, prebiotic, and postbiotic products. Applying emerging technologies to probiotic products can increase probiotic survival and improve probiotic properties (cholesterol attachment, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, increase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities, and decrease systolic blood pressure). Furthermore, it can optimize the fermentation process, produce or maintain compounds of interest (bacteriocin, oligosaccharides, peptides, phenolic compounds, flavonoids), improve bioactivity (vitamin, aglycones, calcium), and sensory characteristics. Applying emerging technologies to prebiotic products did not result in prebiotic degradation. Still, it contributed to higher concentrations of bioactive compounds (citric and ascorbic acids, anthocyanin, polyphenols, flavonoids) and health properties (antioxidant activity and inhibition of ACE, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase). Emerging technologies may also be applied to obtain postbiotics with increased health effects. In this way, current studies suggest that emerging food processing technologies enhance the efficiency of probiotics and prebiotics in food. The information provided may help food industries to choose a more suitable technology to process their products and provide a basis for the most used process parameters. Furthermore, the current gaps are discussed. Emerging technologies may be used to process food products resulting in increased probiotic functionality, prebiotic stability, and higher concentrations of bioactive compounds. In addition, they can be used to obtain postbiotic products with improved health effects compared to the conventional heat treatment.",

      "abstract": "Coffee is a popular and widely consumed beverage worldwide, with epidemiological studies showing reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, cancers and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, few studies have investigated the health effects of the post-brewing coffee product, spent coffee grounds (SCG), from either hot- or cold-brew coffee. SCG from hot-brew coffee improved metabolic parameters in rats with diet-induced metabolic syndrome and improved gut microbiome in these rats and in humans; further, SCG reduced energy consumption in humans. SCG contains similar bioactive compounds as the beverage including caffeine, chlorogenic acids, trigonelline, polyphenols and melanoidins, with established health benefits and safety for human consumption. Further, SCG utilisation could reduce the estimated 6-8 million tonnes of waste each year worldwide from production of coffee as a beverage. In this article, we explore SCG as a major by-product of coffee production and consumption, together with the potential economic impacts of health and non-health applications of SCG. The known bioactive compounds present in hot- and cold-brew coffee and SCG show potential effects in cardiovascular disease, cancer, liver disease and metabolic disorders. Based on these potential health benefits of SCG, it is expected that foods including SCG may moderate chronic human disease while reducing the environmental impact of waste otherwise dumped in landfill.",

      "abstract": "With an increase in life expectancy and decrease of quality-of-life couple with the high prevalence of diseases, diet is expected to play a key function in sustaining human health. Nutritionists, food technologists and medical experts are working in synergy to cater for the increasing demand of food with associated therapeutic benefits, commonly known as functional food, that may improve well-being and reduce the risk of diseases. Interestingly, the marine ecosystem, due to its abundant and phenomenal biodiversity of marine organisms, constitutes a vital source of a panoply of healthy foods supply for the thriving functional food industry. Marine organisms such as seaweeds, sea cucumbers, sponges, and mollusks amongst others are sources of thousands of biologically active metabolites with antioxidant, anti-parasitic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. Given the growing number of research and interest to probe into the therapeutic roles of marine products, this review was designed to provide a comprehensive summary of the therapeutic properties of marine organisms (macroalgae, sea cucumbers and fish among others) which are consumed worldwide, in addition to their potentials and as sources of functional ingredients for developing novel food and fostering wellness. The gap between research development and actual commercialization, and future prospects of marine-based products also summarized to some extent.",

      "abstract": "Several works have shown different aspects of the use of the plant Moringa oleifera. However, few review studies bring an approach to its use in food preparation, specifying its role as a functional food and its use as a natural additive, focusing on food biochemistry and including sensory acceptance and safety. Composed by multiple bioactive substances, Moringa oleifera has the potential to be used as a food additive, mainly as a preservative with the potential to prevent lipid oxidation and other unwanted chemical reactions that lead to product deterioration. Furthermore, it can improve the physicochemical characteristics of food, increasing its quality and shelf life. It also promotes nutritional improvement, elevating protein, mineral, and vitamin levels. Despite this, the sensorial characteristics of this plant result in a low consumer acceptance of the fortified products, which is a problem for the food industry. Apart from inconclusive works, some data involving Moringa's safety are contradictory, resulting in its commercialization prohibition in Brazil in 2019. This review focused on important data about Moringa use to contribute to the literature and to the food industry, describing information about this medicinal plant effects on food products.",

Now PMF has been used to produce antibodies, vaccines, and medicinal proteins, but it has not been well-studied for production of nutraceuticals and functional food. In this perspective, we extend the concept of PMF, present an updated overview of PMF for functional food development, including the progress, problem, and strategy, and then speculate how to use the PMF strategy to produce functional foods, especially with four major staple food crops (rice, wheat, maize, and soybean).

      "abstract": "Food is the essential need of human life and has nutrients that support growth and health. Gastrointestinal tract microbiota involves valuable microorganisms that develop therapeutic effects and are characterized as probiotics. The investigations on appropriate probiotic strains have led to the characterization of specific metabolic byproducts of probiotics named postbiotics. The probiotics must maintain their survival against inappropriate lethal conditions of the processing, storage, distribution, preparation, and digestion system so that they can exhibit their most health effects. Conversely, probiotic metabolites (postbiotics) have successfully overcome these unfavorable conditions and may be an appropriate alternative to probiotics. Due to their specific chemical structure, safe profile, long shelf-life, and the fact that they contain various signaling molecules, postbiotics may have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive properties, inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation and antioxidative activities. Consequently, present scientific literature approves that postbiotics can mimic the fundamental and clinical role of probiotics, and due to their unique characteristics, they can be applied in an oral delivery system (pharmaceutical/functional foods), as a preharvest food safety hurdle, to promote the shelf-life of food products and develop novel functional foods or/and for developing health benefits, and therapeutic aims. This review addresses the latest postbiotic applications with regard to pharmaceutical formulations and commercial food-based products. Potential postbiotic applications in the promotion of host health status, prevention of disease, and complementary treatment are also reviewed.",

      "title": "Functional Food and Bioactive Compounds on the Modulation of the Functionality of HDL-C: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a serious public health problem and are the primary cause of death worldwide. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has been identified as one of the most important molecules in the prevention of CVD due to its multiple anti-inflammatories, anti-atherogenic, and antioxidant properties. Currently, it has been observed that maintaining healthy levels of HDL-C does not seem to be sufficient if the functionality of this particle is not adequate. Modifications in the structure and composition of HDL-C lead to a pro-inflammatory, pro-oxidant, and dysfunctional version of the molecule. Various assays have evaluated some HDL-C functions on risk populations, but they were not the main objective in some of these. Functional foods and dietary compounds such as extra virgin olive oil, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fresh fish, quercetin, curcumin, ginger, resveratrol, and other polyphenols could increase HDL functionality by improving the cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC), paraoxonase 1 (PON1), and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. Nevertheless, additional rigorous research basic and applied is required in order to better understand the association between diet and HDL functionality. This will enable the development of nutritional precision management guidelines for healthy HDL to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults. The aim of the study was to increase the understanding of dietary compounds (functional foods and bioactive components) on the functionality of HDL.",

      "abstract": "Plant-derived polysaccharides have emerged as sustainable biopolymers for fabricating nanoparticles (polysaccharide-based nanomaterials [PS-NPs]), presenting unique opportunities to enhance food functionality and human health. PS-NPs exhibit exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural versatility, enabling their integration into functional foods to positively influence gut microbiota. This review explores the mechanisms of PS-NPs interaction with gut microbiota, highlighting their ability to promote beneficial microbial populations, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, and stimulate the production of short-chain fatty acids. Key synthesis and stabilization methods of PS-NPs are discussed, focusing on their role in improving bioavailability, stability, and gastrointestinal delivery of bioactive compounds in food systems. The potential of PS-NPs to address challenges in food science, including enhancing nutrient absorption, mitigating intestinal dysbiosis, and supporting sustainable food production through innovative nanotechnology, is critically evaluated. Barriers such as enzymatic degradation and physicochemical stability are analyzed, alongside strategies to optimize their functionality within complex food matrices. The integration of PS-NPs in food systems offers a novel approach to modulate gut microbiota, improve intestinal health, and drive the development of next-generation functional foods. Future research should focus on bridging knowledge gaps in metagenomic and metabolomic profiling of PS-NPs, optimizing their design for diverse applications, and advancing their role in sustainable and health-promoting food innovations.",

      "abstract": "Immunomodulatory peptides are a complex class of bioactive peptides that encompasses substances with different mechanisms of action. Immunomodulatory peptides could also be used in vaccines as adjuvants which would be extremely desirable, especially in response to pandemics. Thus, immunomodulatory peptides in food of plant origin could be regarded both as valuable suplements of novel functional food preparation and/or as precursors or possible active ingredients for drugs design for treatment variety of conditions arising from impaired function of immune system. Given variety of mechanisms, different tests are required to assess effects of immunomodulatory peptides. Some of those effects show good correlation with in vivo results but others, less so. Certain plant peptides, such as defensins, show both immunomodulatory and antimicrobial effect, which makes them interesting candidates for preparation of functional food and feed, as well as templates for design of synthetic peptides.",

There is growing interest in functional food that not only provides basic nutrition but has also been demonstrated to be an opportunity for the prevention of disorders. A promising functional food is soybean, which is the richest source of the isoflavone, genistein. Genistein may be useful in the prevention and treatment of such disorders as psoriasis, cataracts, cystic fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. However, achievable concentrations of genistein in humans are low, and the use of soybean as a functional food is not devoid of concerns, which are related to genistein's potential side effects resulting from its estrogenic and goitrogenic effects.",

      "abstract": "Due to the increased prevalence of overweight, obesity, diabetes, colon cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome, dietary approaches to reduce starch digestion and regulate glucose homeostasis have gained attention. Starch is a polysaccharide in most daily food consumed as bakery products, snacks, breakfast cereals, and pasta, which are often vilified. However, it is also present in beans, lentils, and oatmeal, which are considered healthy food products. The difference relays on the food matrix and the thermal process that can produce interactions between starch and dietary compounds (protein, lipid, non-starch polysaccharide, and bioactive compounds) or among starch chains (retrogradation). Such interactions produce structural changes so the digestive enzymes cannot hydrolyze them; additionally, the physical barrier of some macromolecules (proteins, hydrocolloids) restricts starch gelatinization and accessibility of the digestive enzymes to hydrolyze the starch. The interactions mentioned above and the use of some macromolecules as physical barriers could be explored as a pathway to develop functional foods. This review analyzes the interactions between starch and dietary compounds influenced by the processing of some food matrices to better understand their potential for developing functional foods.",

      "abstract": "The current relevance of a healthy diet in well-being has led to a surging interest in designing novel functional food products enriched by biologically active molecules. As nature-inspired bioactive components, several lines of research have revealed the capability of polyphenolic compounds (phenolics) in the medical intervention of different ailments, i.e., tumors, cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Phenolics typically possess antioxidant and antibacterial properties and, due to their unique molecular structure, can offer superior platforms for designing functional products. They can protect food ingredients from oxidation and promote the physicochemical attributes of proteins and carbohydrate-based materials. Even though these properties contribute to the inherent benefits of bioactive phenolics as important functional ingredients in the food industry, the in vitro/in vivo instability, poor solubility, and low bioavailability are the main factors restricting their food/pharma applicability. Recent advances in the encapsulation realm are now offering efficient platforms to overcome these limitations. The application of encapsulation field may offer protection and controlled delivery of phenolics in food formulations. Here, we review recent advances in micro/nanoencapsulation of phenolics and highlight efficient carriers from this decade, which have been utilized successfully in food applications. Although further development of phenolic-containing formulations promises to design novel functional food formulations, and revolutionize the food industry, most of the strategies found in the scientific literature are not commercially applicable. Moreover, in vivo experiments are extremely crucial to corroborate the efficiency of such products.",

      "abstract": "Globally, the demand for functional foods and beverages has significantly increased due to socioeconomic changes, particularly in health consciousness to enhance their functionality. Functional ingredients derived from botanicals are widely used because of their phytochemical properties with health benefits. This study aims to (1) review the capabilities and challenges of botanical addition in functional foods, (2) review current policies and regulations for functional foods containing botanicals in the European Union (EU), Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand, and (3) provide recommendations on effective food safety control measures for better consumer trust and trade facilitation. This critical review was analyzed from online publications and available guidelines, regulations, and control measures published by food industries and governments in the EU and the four selected countries. The result confirmed that potentialities of botanicals arise from numerous bioactive compounds with varieties of sources. However, the usage may potentially raise health risks through hazardous substances in different species or plant parts, contaminants from environments and uncontrolled processes. Inadequate knowledge of botanical formulation and the maximum limit for daily consumption may elevate health risks through food-drug interaction or adverse effect incidents. Current policies and regulations show that varieties of measures are implemented influencing both economic growth and consumer awareness. The novel finding is that countries that provide a comprehensive national food control system influence not only the growth of the functional food subsectors but also build trust in food safety among trade partners and consumers.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the emerging concern regarding safety issues associated with live bacterial cells is enhancing the interest in using cell components and metabolites derived from microbiota. Therefore, the term \"postbiotics\" is increasingly found in food microbiology, food scientific and commercial products. Postbiotics is defined as non-viable microorganisms or their components that provide benefits to the host. Many in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that beneficial microbiota-generated extracellular nanoparticles (NPs) confer unique health promoting functions to the intestinal local and systemic effects, which can be considered as a novel postbiotics. Meanwhile, the postbiotics-NPs is a protective complex, delivering bioactive components to reach distant tissues and organs at high concentrations. These properties demonstrate that postbiotics-NPs may contribute to the improvement of host health by regulating specific gut microbiota and physiological functions, while the exact mechanisms are not fully elucidated. This review highlights the current understanding of postbiotics-NPs functional properties and mechanisms of health benefits, especially focusing on the interactions in gut microbiota and host, functions in human health and potential applications in future functional food and biomedical fields.",

      "title": "Antioxidant Properties of Hemp Proteins: From Functional Food to Phytotherapy and Beyond.",
      "abstract": "As one of the oldest plants cultivated by humans, hemp used to be banned in the United States but returned as a legal crop in 2018. Since then, the United States has become the leading hemp producer in the world. Currently, hemp attracts increasing attention from consumers and scientists as hemp products provide a wide spectrum of potential functions. Particularly, bioactive peptides derived from hemp proteins have been proven to be strong antioxidants, which is an extremely hot research topic in recent years. However, some controversial disputes and unknown issues are still underway to be explored and verified in the aspects of technique, methodology, characteristic, mechanism, application, caution, etc. Therefore, this review focusing on the antioxidant properties of hemp proteins is necessary to discuss the multiple critical issues, including in vitro structure-modifying techniques and antioxidant assays, structure-activity relationships of antioxidant peptides, pre-clinical studies on hemp proteins and pathogenesis-related molecular mechanisms, usage and potential hazard, and novel advanced techniques involving bioinformatics methodology (QSAR, PPI, GO, KEGG), proteomic analysis, and genomics analysis, etc. Taken together, the antioxidant potential of hemp proteins may provide both functional food benefits and phytotherapy efficacy to human health.",

      "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a growing public health concern worldwide, and it is now regarded as a critical One Health issue. One Health's interconnected domains contribute to the emergence, evolution, and spread of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms on a local and global scale, which is a significant risk factor for global health. The persistence and spread of resistant microbial species, and the association of determinants at the human-animal-environment interface can alter microbial genomes, resulting in resistant superbugs in various niches. ABR is motivated by a well-established link between three domains: human, animal, and environmental health. As a result, addressing ABR through the One Health approach makes sense. Several countries have implemented national action plans based on the One Health approach to combat antibiotic-resistant microbes, following the Tripartite's Commitment Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)-World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The ABR has been identified as a global health concern, and efforts are being made to mitigate this global health threat. To summarize, global interdisciplinary and unified approaches based on One Health principles are required to limit the ABR dissemination cycle, raise awareness and education about antibiotic use, and promote policy, advocacy, and antimicrobial stewardship.",

      "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence from observational and intervention studies in nutritional psychiatry regarding the importance of diet for mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Here, we synthesise this evidence, including findings from large meta-analyses showing cross-sectional and prospective associations between diet quality and mental health, even following adjustment for relevant confounding factors. Potential mechanistic pathways underpinning these associations include those of the gut-brain axis, demonstrated mostly in animal models. Dietary fibre is an important component of healthy diet and may be relevant for common mental disorders, with some studies showing a dose-dependent relationship between fibre intake and risk of depression. The potential contribution of nutraceuticals is also discussed, such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and psychobiotics. We consider the relevance of special diets such as the ketogenic diet and food sensitivities in the management of severe mental illness (e.g., anorexia nervosa) and brain disease (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Given the relatively early nature of research in nutritional psychiatry, there remain a number of challenges to its translation into clinical practice. These span individual, clinical, and societal domains. We conclude with a discussion of micro- and macroeconomic factors which may be considered in the successful application of nutritional psychiatry research to improve public health.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between nutrition and brain health is intricate. Studies suggest that nutrients during early life impact not only human physiology but also mental health. Although the exact molecular mechanisms that depict this relationship remain unclear, there are indications that environmental factors such as eating, lifestyle habits, stress, and physical activity, influence our genes and modulate their function by epigenetic mechanisms to shape mental health outcomes. Epigenetic mechanisms act as crucial link between genes and environmental influences, proving that non-genetic factors could have enduring effects on the epigenome and influence health trajectories. We review studies that demonstrated an epigenetic mechanism of action of nutrition on mental health, focusing on the role of specific micronutrients during critical stages of brain development. The methyl-donor micronutrients of the one-carbon metabolism, such as choline, betaine, methionine, folic acid, VitB6 and VitB12 play critical roles in various physiological processes, including DNA and histone methylation. These micronutrients have been shown to alter gene function and susceptibility to diseases including mental health and metabolic disorders. Understanding how micronutrients influence metabolic genes in humans can lead to the implementation of early nutritional interventions to reduce the risk of developing metabolic and mental health disorders later in life.",

Food and nutrition, essential in maintenance of brain performance, also aid in prevention and treatment of mental disorders. Both the overall composition of the human diet and specific dietary components have been shown to have an impact on brain function in various experimental models and epidemiological studies. This narrative review provides an overview of the role of diet in 5 key areas of brain function related to mental health and performance, including: (1) brain development, (2) signaling networks and neurotransmitters in the brain, (3) cognition and memory, (4) the balance between protein formation and degradation, and (5) deteriorative effects due to chronic inflammatory processes. Finally, the role of diet in epigenetic regulation of brain physiology is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Altered intestinal permeability plays a role in many pathological conditions. Intestinal permeability is a component of the intestinal barrier. This barrier is a dynamic interface between the body and the food and pathogens that enter the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, dietary components can directly affect this interface, and many metabolites produced by the host enzymes or the gut microbiota can act as signaling molecules or exert direct effects on this barrier. Our aim was to examine the effects of diet components on the intestinal barrier in health and disease states. Herein, we conducted an in-depth PubMed search based on specific key words (diet, permeability, barrier, health, disease, and disorder), as well as cross references from those articles. The normal intestinal barrier consists of multiple components in the lumen, epithelial cell layer and the lamina propria. Diverse methods are available to measure intestinal permeability. We focus predominantly on human in vivo studies, and the literature is reviewed to identify dietary factors that decrease (e.g., emulsifiers, surfactants, and alcohol) or increase (e.g., fiber, short-chain fatty acids, glutamine, and vitamin D) barrier integrity. Effects of these dietary items in disease states, such as metabolic syndrome, liver disease, or colitis are documented as examples of barrier dysfunction in the multifactorial diseases. Effects of diet on intestinal barrier function are associated with precise mechanisms in some instances; further research of those mechanisms has potential to clarify the role of dietary interventions in treating diverse pathologic states.",

At the same time, increasing DF intake should be seen as a major public health problem since worldwide intakes are quite far from recommendations. The awareness of this fact by public bodies should lead, among others, to the assessment of effective strategies for promoting DF intake among general population or specific groups; and to consider potential regulatory modifications in order to clarify several aspects potentially misleading for consumers.",

As such, a better understanding of it is crucial to establish priorities for dietary guidelines and to inform, design, and implement strategies for preventing, helping manage, and stopping the progression of sleep and mental health-related symptoms/disorders. The aim of the current study is to conduct the largest investigation of diet, sleep, and mental health to date by utilizing the UK Biobank (UKB) dataset to identify the associations between diet and (i) sleep quality/health, and (ii) mental health symptomatology. This cross-sectional population-based study involved 502,494 middle-aged adults. UKB food frequency, sleep, and psychological factors and mental health questionnaires at baseline were used. Scores were also calculated for healthy diet, healthy sleep, mental health symptomatology, partial fibre intake, and milk intake. We observed positive associations with healthy diet and sleep and mental health, especially benefits of high intakes of vegetable, fruit, fish, water, and fibre. However, processed meat and milk intake were adversely associated with sleep and mental health. These findings make clear that there are health and wellbeing benefits and drawbacks of different diets, but do not, at this stage, demonstrate the clear causal relationships, which would support dietary interventions that might play a role in the treatment and also self-management of sleep and mental health disorders/symptoms. Further research is required to understand mechanisms of actions of which diet acts on to modulate sleep and mental health, while taking comorbidity of sleep and mental health disorders/symptoms into consideration.",

      "abstract": "Food allergy represents a failure of oral tolerance mechanisms to dietary antigens. Over the past few years, food allergies have become a growing public health problem worldwide. Gut microbiota is believed to have a significant impact on oral tolerance to food antigens and in initiation and maintenance of food allergies. Therefore, probiotics have also been proposed in this field as a possible strategy for modulating both the gut microbiota and the immune system. In recent years, results from preclinical and clinical studies suggest a promising role for probiotics in food allergy prevention and treatment. However, future studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of action of probiotics in food allergies and to design comparable study protocols using specific probiotic strains, defined doses and exposure times, and longer follow-up periods.",

      "abstract": "The last decade has seen nearly 20 papers reviewing the totality of the data on saturated fats and cardiovascular outcomes, which, altogether, have demonstrated a lack of rigorous evidence to support continued recommendations either to limit the consumption of saturated fatty acids or to replace them with polyunsaturated fatty acids. These papers were unfortunately not considered by the process leading to the most recent U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the country's national nutrition policy, which recently reconfirmed its recommendation to limit saturated fats to 10% or less of total energy intake, based on insufficient and inconsistent evidence. Continuation of a cap on saturated fat intake also fails to consider the important effects of the food matrix and the overall dietary pattern in which saturated fatty acids are consumed.",

      "title": "Ultra-Processed Foods and Mental Health: Where Do Eating Disorders Fit into the Puzzle?",
      "abstract": "Ultra-processed foods (UPFs) like pastries, packaged snacks, fast foods, and sweetened beverages have become dominant in the modern food supply and are strongly associated with numerous public health concerns. While the physical health consequences of UPF intake have been well documented (e.g., increased risks of cardiometabolic conditions), less empirical discussion has emphasized the mental health consequences of chronic UPF consumption. Notably, the unique characteristics of UPFs (e.g., artificially high levels of reinforcing ingredients) influence biological processes (e.g., dopamine signaling) in a manner that may contribute to poorer psychological functioning for some individuals. Importantly, gold-standard behavioral lifestyle interventions and treatments specifically for disordered eating do not acknowledge the direct role that UPFs may play in sensitizing reward-related neural functioning, disrupting metabolic responses, and motivating subsequent UPF cravings and intake. The lack of consideration for the influences of UPFs on mental health is particularly problematic given the growing scientific support for the addictive properties of these foods and the utility of ultra-processed food addiction (UPFA) as a novel clinical phenotype endorsed by 14-20% of individuals across international samples. The overarching aim of the present review is to summarize the science of how UPFs may affect mental health, emphasizing contributing biological mechanisms. Specifically, the authors will (1) describe how corporate-sponsored research and financial agendas have contributed to contention and debate about the role of UPFs in health; (2) define UPFs and their nutritional characteristics; (3) review observed associations between UPF intake and mental health conditions, especially with depression; (4) outline the evidence for UPFA; and (5) describe nuanced treatment considerations for comorbid UPFA and eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "Precise protein supplementation strategies for muscle improvement are still lacking. The timing or type of protein supplementation has been debated as a window of opportunity to improve muscle mass, strength, and physical performance. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with protein supplements and resistance training. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched until May 1, 2023. We included 116 eligible trials with 4,711 participants that reported on 11 timing and 14 types of protein supplementation. Compared with placebo, protein supplementation after exercise (mean difference [MD]: 0.54 kg [95% confidence intervals 0.10, 0.99] for fat-free mass, MD: 0.34 kg [95% confidence intervals 0.10, 0.58] for skeletal muscle mass) and at night (MD: 2.85 kg [0.49, 5.22] for handgrip strength, MD: 12.12 kg [3.26, 20.99] for leg press strength) was most effective in improving muscle mass and strength, respectively (moderate certainty). Milk proteins (milk, whey protein, yogurt, casein, and bovine colostrum), red meat, and mixed protein were effective for gains in both muscle mass and strength (moderate certainty). No timing or type of protein showed a significant enhancement in physical performance (timed up-to-go test, 6-min walk test, and gait speed). Pre/postexercise and Night are key recommended times of protein intake to increase muscle mass and strength, respectively. Milk proteins are the preferred types of protein supplements for improving muscle mass and strength. Future randomized controlled trials that directly compare the effects of protein timing or types are needed. This trial was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews as CRD42022358766.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

On the basis of a comparison of FBDGs and literature reviews with the current Nutri-Score classification, modification scenarios were developed and tested in nutritional composition databases of branded products in four countries. The updated Nutri-Score nutrient profile model allows a better discrimination between products, in closer alignment with FBDGs, while the updated algorithm adopts a stricter approach for products that are high in components of concern (including non-nutritive sweeteners) and low in favourable dietary components. The updated Nutri-Score algorithm increases the alignment between the front-of-pack label system and FBDGs, strengthening its potential as a complementary public health tool in an international perspective.",

      "abstract": "Food-related issues are on the rise in urban areas around the world. Issues include unhealthy food habits and eating practices, disconnection from food and culture, social isolation and environmental unsustainability. There has been increasing consideration of pedagogical approaches, or food pedagogies, to address these challenges. This paper aims to identify the key elements and influences over food-related activities within food pedagogies that strive to improve urban health and sustainability. A scoping literature review was conducted using five electronic databases. Of the 271 abstracts identified, thirty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. The review identified four key elements: 'Everyday food experiences', 'Social relations', 'Culture', and 'Sustainable lifestyles' and two main influences: 'Professionals involved with food-related activities' and 'Spaces of learning/experiencing food-related activities'. The key elements and influences embrace pedagogical and practical attributes of food pedagogies that address the complex food-related issues. However, limited published research examines food pedagogies or attempts to develop an agreed, theoretically informed framework. This review provides understanding of important knowledge and practical implications of food pedagogies for multiple stakeholders involved in food-related activities, useful to the development of food education programs and food policies or initiatives for societal health and sustainability in urban areas.",

      "abstract": "Settler colonialism disrupted traditional Indigenous foodways and practices and created high rates of diet-related disease among Indigenous peoples. Food sovereignty, the rights of Indigenous peoples to determine their own food systems, is a culturally centered movement rooted in traditional Indigenous knowledge. This approach directly intervenes upon systems-level barriers to health, making it an important strategy for health equity. While food sovereignty initiatives can be found within many Indigenous communities, the conceptual linkages between food sovereignty and health have not been well documented within the public health literature. We present a practice-informed conceptual framework developed as part of the Center for Indigenous Innovation and Health Equity (CIIHE) initiative, a community-academic partnership with the goal of strengthening Indigenous food systems and practices to promote health and well-being. The framework emphasizes connectedness, including the transmission of knowledge across generations and the restoration of relational responsibilities, as central to Indigenous concepts of health and wellness.",

      "abstract": "Oral health is essential for both overall health and quality of life. The mouth is a window into the body's health, and nutrition can strongly impact the state of general and oral health. A healthy diet involves the synergistic effect of various nutraceutical agents, potentially capable of conferring protective actions against some inflammatory and chronic-degenerative disorders. Nutraceuticals, mostly present in plant-derived products, present multiple potential clinical, preventive, and therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, preclinical and epidemiological studies suggested a protective role for these compounds, but their real preventive and therapeutic effects in humans still await confirmation. Available evidence suggests that plant extracts are more effective than individual constituents because they contain different phytochemicals with multiple pharmacological targets and additive/synergistic effects, maximizing the benefits for oral health. Moreover, nutritional recommendations for oral health should be personalized and aligned with valid suggestions for overall health. This review is aimed to: introduce the basic concepts of nutraceuticals, including their main food sources; examine the logic that supports their relationship with oral health, and summarize and critically discuss clinical trials testing the utility of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Malnutrition, in all its forms, during the critical stages of child growth and development can have lifelong impacts on health and well-being. While most forms of malnutrition can be prevented with simple dietary interventions, both undernutrition and overnutrition remain persistent and burdensome challenges for large portions of the global population, especially for young children who are dependent on others for nourishment. In addition to dietary factors, children's health also faces the growing challenges of climate change, environmental degradation, pollution, and infectious disease. Food production and consumption practices both sit at the nexus of these issues, and both must be significantly transformed if we are to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Food sources (i.e., animal-source foods vs. plant-source foods), food production practices, the effects of food processing, the impacts of a more globalized food system, and food loss and waste have all been receiving growing attention in health and sustainability research and policy discussions. Much of this work points to recommendations to reduce resource-intensive animal-source foods, heavily processed foods, and foods associated with excessive waste and pollution, while simultaneously increasing plant-source options. However, some of these recommendations require a little more nuance when considered in the context of issues such as global child health. All types of foods can play significant roles in providing essential nutrition for children across the globe, and for improving the well-being and livelihoods of their families and communities. Dairy foods provide a prime example of this need for nuance, as both dairy production practices and consumption patterns vary greatly throughout the world, as do their impacts on child health and food system sustainability. The objective of this narrative review is to highlight the role of dairy in supporting child health in the context of food system sustainability. When considering child health within this context it is recommended to take a holistic approach that considers all four domains of sustainability (health, economics, society, and the environment) to better weigh trade-offs, optimize outcomes, and avoid unintended consequences. To ensure that children have access to nutritious and safe foods within sustainable food systems, special consideration of their needs must be included within the broader food systems transformation narrative.",

      "abstract": "Food waste and nutrition are intrinsically linked in terms of environmental health and public health. Despite this, it is unknown whether these topics have been previously synthesized into a review. The aim was to identify the interdisciplinary parameters that exist in public health and nutrition literature in terms of food waste and plastic waste associated with food, and to identify how these parameters currently contribute to food sustainability messaging and interventions. A rapid scoping review was conducted. Data were mapped into concepts and synthesized in a narrative review. Four main concepts were identified: (1) food waste and diet quality, nutrient losses, and environmental health, (2) food waste reduction interventions and diet quality, (3) food banks/pantries and diet/nutritional quality, and (4) food and plastic waste messaging in nutrition or dietary guidelines. Food waste is associated with nutrient wastage, and interventions to reduce food waste can successfully address food sustainability and nutrition quality. Food redistribution systems do not currently address access to sustainably sourced foods that are also nutrient-dense for lower-income communities. Opportunities for future research and practice include aligning food waste, plastic waste, and nutrition priorities together and developing better food redistribution systems to limit wastage of high-quality foods.",

In this review, the seaweed aquaculture's potential impact on the wildlife and human welfare and the environmental integrity has been evaluated using the One Health approach, a principle in which human, animal, and environmental health outcomes are considered as strictly connected. This is the first effort to implement the One Health concept into the seaweed cultivation assessment, and it is meant to give new perspectives for the growth of this industry.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable nutrition, equaling earth health, involves a personalized approach designed in terms of precision and avoidance of still cogent but unjustified dogmas, equaling public health. For instance, current dietary recommendations continue to dwell on the need to limit as much as possible the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), notwithstanding the mounting evidence that the effects of food on health cannot be predicted from the content of single nutrients without considering the overall macronutrient composition and the role of the food matrix. The traditional recommendation to restrict SFA ignores that their effects on health depend on the interaction between naturally occurring food components and those introduced by food processing. It is warranted to modify the still widely promoted dietary guidelines based upon such single nutrients as SFA and instead personalize dietary habits on the basis of the whole pattern of the food matrix. Accordingly, the double edge of malnutrition, that involves deficiency as well as excess and materializes in many individuals throughout their life course, might be tackled by implementing sustainability, with the additional effect of overcoming global inequalities. Within this context SFA may regain their position of tasty and cheap sources of energy to be adapted to each individual lifestyle.",

In February 2022, the CIIHE sponsored and hosted a virtual conference to better understand how food sovereignty initiatives can improve health. More than 600 participants gathered to hear the latest research and practice in the areas of public health and agriculture, nutrition, community-based and Indigenous knowledge, and health economics. Community-led food sovereignty initiatives being implemented as part of the CIIHE were featured along with other Indigenous initiatives in urban, rural, and reservation communities. A survey was administered to conference participants to assess food sovereignty topics and priorities for future research.

Undigested fructooligosaccharides in the large intestine are utilised by the beneficial microorganisms for the synthesis of short-chain fatty acids for their own growth. Although various food products are now recognized as having prebiotic properties, several others, such as almonds, artichoke, barley, chia seeds, chicory, dandelion greens, flaxseeds, garlic, and oats, are being explored and used as functional foods. Considering the benefits of these prebiotics in mineral absorption, metabolite production, gut microbiota modulation, and in various diseases such as diabetes, allergy, metabolic disorders, and necrotising enterocolitis, increasing attention has been focused on their applications in both food and pharmaceutical industries, although some of these food products are actually used as food supplements. This review aims to highlight the potential and need of these prebiotics in the diet and also discusses data related to the distinct types, sources, modes of action, and health benefits.",

      "abstract": "Current modern dietary patterns throughout the world have resulted in adverse health implications. On the other hand, current agricultural practices and methods employed in food industries lead to the exploitation of the environment and generate nutrient-rich waste, which is underutilized. The simple answer to both these problems could be the adoption of fermentation technology. Due to the presence of functional microorganisms, fermented foods possess unique properties like probiotics properties, antimicrobial, antioxidant, peptide production, etc., imparting health benefits to consumers. Moreover, agricultural and food processing waste fermentation could generate value-added healthy foods and sustainable food sources. Not only this, fermented food products can be an essential source of generating livelihoods by producing necessary food ingredients through fermentation of commonly generated organic wastes in rural areas and encouraging and promoting traditional fermented recipes that are also healthy. This review discusses how reviving and promoting food fermentation technology can help reduce these two problems related to health and sustainability. Furthermore, the role of lactic acid bacteria and fungi like yeast, Penicillium, Acetobacter etc., in producing beneficial metabolites and their impact on controlling various lifestyle disorders and aging have been discussed. In addition, fermented foods also enrich gut microbiota, which imparts health benefits.",

      "title": "Perspective: Organic food consumption during pregnancy and the potential effects on maternal and offspring health.",
      "abstract": "Pregnancy represents a critical window for both maternal and child health. Previous studies have shown that the consumption of an organic diet during pregnancy can reduce pesticide exposure compared with the consumption of a conventional diet. It is possible that this could, in turn, improve pregnancy outcomes, because maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of pregnancy complications. Organic foods are produced by methods that comply with organic standards, generally restricting the use of agrochemicals, such as synthetic pesticides. In the past few decades, the global demand for organic foods has increased drastically, driven in large part by consumer beliefs that organic foods provide benefits to human health. However, the effects of organic food consumption during pregnancy on maternal and child health have not been established. This narrative review aims to summarize current evidence regarding the consumption of organic foods during pregnancy and the potential effects on short- and long-term health outcomes in mothers and offspring. We performed a comprehensive literature search and identified studies investigating the association between organic food consumption during pregnancy and health outcomes in mothers and their offspring. The outcomes identified from the literature search included pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, and otitis media. Although existing studies suggest that consumption of organic foods (overall or a specific kind) during pregnancy may have health benefits, further investigation to replicate the findings in other populations is needed. Moreover, because these previous studies have all been observational and thus may be limited by the potential for residual confounding and reverse causation, causal inference cannot be established. We argue that the next necessary step in this research is a randomized trial to test the efficacy of organic diet intervention in pregnancy on maternal and offspring health.",

      "abstract": "Endotoxin is a complex molecule derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and it has strong thermal stability. The processing of infant food can kill pathogenic bacteria but cannot remove endotoxin. Because the intestinal structure of infants is not fully developed, residual endotoxin poses a threat to their health by damaging the intestinal flora and inducing intestinal inflammation, obesity, and sepsis, among others. This paper discusses the sources and contents of endotoxin in infant food and methods for preventing endotoxin from harming infants. However, there is no clear evidence that endotoxin levels in infant food cause significant immune symptoms or even diseases in infants. However, in order to improve the safety level of infant food and reduce the endotoxin content, this issue should not be ignored. The purpose of this review is to provide a theoretical basis for manufacturers and consumers to understand the possible harm of endotoxin content in infant formula milk powder and to explore how to reduce its level in infant formula milk powder. Generally, producers should focus on cleaning the milk source, securing the cold chain, avoiding long-distance transportation, and shortening the storage time of raw milk to reduce the level of bacteria and endotoxin. After production and processing, the endotoxin content should be measured as an important index to test the quality of infant formula milk powder so as to provide high-quality infant products for the healthy growth of newborns.",

Prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to beneficially modulate the gut microbiome, which underlies their potential for benefit in GI conditions. Formulating specific recommendations for the public regarding these dietary supplements has been difficult due to the significant heterogeneity between strains, doses, and duration of treatment investigated across studies, as well as safety concerns with administering live organisms. This review aims to summarize the existing evidence for the use of prebiotics and probiotics in various GI disorders, paying special attention to strain-specific effects that emerged and any adverse effects noted.",

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals represent substances derived from food or plants that provide medical or health benefits, and are increasingly sought by patients as a means of treating migraine in a natural, effective, and safe manner as conventional therapies often fail, are expensive, and laden with side effects. This chapter reviews various nutraceutical therapies for migraine including phytomedicines (plant-based therapies), diets for migraine management and vitamin, mineral, and supplement-based treatments for migraine with respect to preclinical and clinical evidence. Reviewed herein are a multitude of nutraceutical options for the treatment of migraine including vitamins (e.g., riboflavin), antioxidants, and plants/phytomedicines: feverfew, butterbur, cannabis, St. John's Wort, Rosa x damascena, and Gingko biloba. Dietary interventions for migraine include low lipid, vegan, ketogenic, and DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). Supplements such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as well as l-carnitine, pre/probiotics, and melatonin are also discussed. Migraine patients and their caregivers have an armamentarium of nutraceutical options to treat headache. While some therapies such as vitamins harbor stronger evidence with more rigorous studies, patients may also choose dietary therapies that may offer more systemic health benefits while also improving migraine. As cannabis legalization spreads worldwide, care providers must be aware of the limited evidence in migraine. Future studies may explore traditional ancient medicines for migraine at basic science and clinical level, while currently adopted and new nutraceutical treatments may benefit from partnership with industry to engage in larger trials in humans.",

It is characterized by pain, stiffness, and a reduced range of motion with regard to the arthritic joints. These symptoms can cause in the long term a greater risk of overweight/obesity, diabetes mellitus, and falls and fractures. Although the current guidelines for the treatment of OA suggest, as the gold standard for this condition, pharmacological treatment characterized by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-specific drugs, a great interest has been applied to nutraceutical supplements, which include a heterogeneous class of molecules with great potential to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, pain, and joint stiffness and improve cartilage formation. The purpose of this review is to describe the potential application of nutraceuticals in OA, highlighting its molecular mechanisms of actions and data of efficacy and safety (when available).",

      "title": "Nutraceutical activation of Sirt1: a review.",
      "abstract": "The deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), activated by calorie restriction and fasting, exerts several complementary effects on cellular function that are favourable to healthspan; it is often thought of as an 'anti-aging' enzyme. Practical measures which might boost Sirt1 activity are therefore of considerable interest. A number of nutraceuticals have potential in this regard. Nutraceuticals reported to enhance Sirt1 synthesis or protein expression include ferulic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, urolithin A, melatonin, astaxanthin, carnosic acid and neochlorogenic acid. The half-life of Sirt1 protein can be enhanced with the natural nicotinamide catabolite N1-methylnicotinamide. The availability of Sirt1's obligate substrate NAD+ can be increased in several ways: nicotinamide riboside and nicotinamide mononucleotide can function as substrates for NAD+ synthesis; activators of AMP-activated kinase-such as berberine-can increase expression of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase, which is rate limiting for NAD+ synthesis; and nutraceutical quinones such as thymoquinone and pyrroloquinoline quinone can boost NAD+ by promoting oxidation of NADH. Induced ketosis-as via ingestion of medium-chain triglycerides-can increase NAD+ in the brain by lessening the reduction of NAD+ mediated by glycolysis. Post-translational modifications of Sirt1 by O-GlcNAcylation or sulfonation can increase its activity, suggesting that administration of glucosamine or of agents promoting hydrogen sulfide synthesis may aid Sirt1 activity. Although resveratrol has poor pharmacokinetics, it can bind to Sirt1 and activate it allosterically-as can so-called sirtuin-activating compound drugs. Since oxidative stress can reduce Sirt1 activity in multiple ways, effective antioxidant supplementation that blunts such stress may also help preserve Sirt1 activity in some circumstances. Combination nutraceutical regimens providing physiologically meaningful doses of several of these agents, capable of activating Sirt1 in complementary ways, may have considerable potential for health promotion. Such measures may also amplify the benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in non-diabetic disorders, as these benefits appear to reflect upregulation of Sirt1 and AMP-activated protein kinase activities.",

      "title": "Nuts: Natural Pleiotropic Nutraceuticals.",
      "abstract": "Common nuts (tree nuts and peanuts) are energy-dense foods that nature has gifted with a complex matrix of beneficial nutrients and bioactives, including monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, high-quality protein, fiber, non-sodium minerals, tocopherols, phytosterols, and antioxidant phenolics. These nut components synergize to favorably influence metabolic and vascular physiology pathways, ameliorate cardiovascular risk factors and improve cardiovascular prognosis. There is increasing evidence that nuts positively impact myriad other health outcomes as well. Nut consumption is correlated with lower cancer incidence and cancer mortality, and decreased all-cause mortality. Favorable effects on cognitive function and depression have also been reported. Randomized controlled trials consistently show nuts have a cholesterol-lowering effect. Nut consumption also confers modest improvements on glycemic control, blood pressure (BP), endothelial function, and inflammation. Although nuts are energy-dense foods, they do not predispose to obesity, and in fact may even help in weight loss. Tree nuts and peanuts, but not peanut butter, generally produce similar positive effects on outcomes. First level evidence from the PREDIMED trial shows that, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, consumption of 30 g/d of nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) significantly lowered the risk of a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular disease) by ≈30% after intervention for 5 y. Impressively, the nut-supplemented diet reduced stroke risk by 45%. As they are rich in salutary bioactive compounds and beneficially impact various health outcomes, nuts can be considered natural pleiotropic nutraceuticals.",

      "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity, low muscle mass, and high body fat are growing health concerns in the aging population. This review highlights the need for standardized criteria and explores nutraceuticals as potential therapeutic agents. Sarcopenic obesity is associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, hormonal changes, and reduced physical activity. These factors lead to impaired muscle activity, intramuscular fat accumulation, and reduced protein synthesis, resulting in muscle catabolism and increased fat mass. Myostatin and irisin are myokines that regulate muscle synthesis and energy expenditure, respectively. Nutritional supplementation with vitamin D and calcium is recommended for increasing muscle mass and reducing body fat content. Testosterone therapy decreases fat mass and improves muscle strength. Vitamin K, specifically menaquinone-4 (MK-4), improves mitochondrial function and reduces muscle damage. Irisin is a hormone secreted during exercise that enhances oxidative metabolism, prevents insulin resistance and obesity, and improves bone quality. Low-glycemic-index diets and green cardamom are potential methods for managing sarcopenic obesity. In conclusion, along with exercise and dietary support, nutraceuticals, such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin K, and natural agonists of irisin or testosterone, can serve as promising future therapeutic alternatives.",

      "abstract": "Systemic antimicrobial treatments are commonly prescribed to dogs with acute diarrhoea, while nutraceuticals (prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics) are frequently administered as an alternative treatment. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of antimicrobials and nutraceutical preparations for treatment of canine acute diarrhoea (CAD). The results of this study will be used to create evidence-based treatment guidelines. PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) were generated by a multidisciplinary expert panel taking into account opinions from stakeholders (general practitioners and dog owners). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to evaluate the certainty of the evidence. The systematic search yielded six randomised controlled trials (RCT) for antimicrobial treatment and six RCTs for nutraceutical treatment meeting the eligibility criteria. Categories of disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) were created based on the presence of systemic signs and response to fluid therapy. Outcomes included duration of diarrhoea, duration of hospitalization, progression of disease, mortality, and adverse effects. High certainty evidence showed that antimicrobial treatment did not have a clinically relevant effect on any outcome in dogs with mild or moderate disease. Certainty of evidence was low for dogs with severe disease. Nutraceutical products did not show a clinically significant effect in shortening the duration of diarrhoea (based on very low to moderate certainty evidence). No adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.",

      "title": "Molecular docking as a tool for the discovery of molecular targets of nutraceuticals in diseases management.",
      "abstract": "Molecular docking is a computational technique that predicts the binding affinity of ligands to receptor proteins. Although it has potential uses in nutraceutical research, it has developed into a formidable tool for drug development. Bioactive substances called nutraceuticals are present in food sources and can be used in the management of diseases. Finding their molecular targets can help in the creation of disease-specific new therapies. The purpose of this review was to explore molecular docking's application to the study of dietary supplements and disease management. First, an overview of the fundamentals of molecular docking and the various software tools available for docking was presented. The limitations and difficulties of using molecular docking in nutraceutical research are also covered, including the reliability of scoring functions and the requirement for experimental validation. Additionally, there was a focus on the identification of molecular targets for nutraceuticals in numerous disease models, including those for sickle cell disease, cancer, cardiovascular, gut, reproductive, and neurodegenerative disorders. We further highlighted biochemistry pathways and models from recent studies that have revealed molecular mechanisms to pinpoint new nutraceuticals' effects on disease pathogenesis. It is convincingly true that molecular docking is a useful tool for identifying the molecular targets of nutraceuticals in the management of diseases. It may offer information about how nutraceuticals work and support the creation of new therapeutics. Therefore, molecular docking has a bright future in nutraceutical research and has a lot of potentials to lead to the creation of brand-new medicines for the treatment of disease.",

      "title": "Dietary Supplements for Erectile Dysfunction: Analysis of Marketed Products, Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis and Rational Use.",
      "abstract": "The use of nutraceutical products to enhance male sexual performance has a long history, especially with regard to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). Alternative treatments for ED are becoming increasingly popular, with growing interest from consumers, as well as increased revenue for manufacturers. Dietary supplements (DSs), which are a mixture of active ingredients, are mainly sold online. In randomized controlled trials, the molecules contained in DSs have demonstrated varying degrees of effectiveness, or even have no evidence to support their use. However, none of the studies carried out provided sufficient evidence to consider these products a first-line therapy. Therefore, the combination of the various active ingredients, especially in relation to the daily dose, leaves doubts about the real effectiveness. In order to evaluate the potential efficacy of DS formulations, we analyzed the products marketed in Italy using a scoring approach. A systematic review of the literature was performed to evaluate the effect of DS and to detect the active ingredients able to improve erectile function-called effective ingredients (EIs)-and their minimal effective daily dose (mED). A metanalysis identified some nutraceuticals, such as Panax ginseng, Tribulus terrestris and L-arginine, that are able to improve male sexual function. Based on the scoring system, 2 (8%) supplements matched with the cluster of higher expected efficacy, 3 (12%) with the lower efficacy cluster and 20 (80%) matched with the criterion of no expected efficacy. DSs marketed in Italy are usually blends of many substances that are frequently employed at a negligible dose or without any evidence.",

      "abstract": "Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) are esters of fatty acids with 6 to 12 carbon atom chains. Naturally, they occur in various sources; their composition and bioactivity are source and extraction process-linked. The molecular size of MCT oil permits unique metabolic pathways and energy production rates, making MCT oil a high-value functional food. This review details the common sources of MCT oil, presenting critical information on the various approaches for MCT oil extraction or synthesis. Apart from conventional techniques, non-thermal processing methods that show promising prospects are analyzed. The biological effects of MCT oil are summarized, and the range of need-driven modification approaches are elaborated. A section is devoted to highlighting the recent trends in the application of MCT oil for food, nutraceuticals, and allied applications. While much is debated about the role of MCT oil in human health and wellness, there is limited information on daily requirements, impact on specific population groups, and effects of long-term consumption. Nonetheless, several studies have been conducted and continue to identify the most effective methods for MCT oil extraction, processing, handling, and storage. A knowledge gap exists and future research must focus on technology packages for scalability and sustainability.",

The WHO estimates the worldwide prevalence of 1.9 billion overweight adults and more than 650 million people with obesity. These alarming data highlight the high and growing prevalence of obesity and represent a risk factor for the development and aggravation of other chronic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is frequently considered the hepatic outcome of type 2 diabetes. The use of non-pharmacological therapies such as food supplements, nutraceuticals, and natural integrative therapies has grown as an alternative tool for obesity-related diseases compared to conventional medications. However, it is a still little explored research field and lacks scientific evidence of therapeutic effectiveness. Considering this, the aim is to evaluate whether a new nutraceutical supplement composition can improve and supply essential mineral nutrients, providing an improvement of obesity-related metabolic and endocrine parameters.",

      "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-related disorder, which is one of the most prevalent and costly benign neoplasms in men with over 94 million cases worldwide. Starting before or around 50 years of age, there is a linear increase in prostate volume and BPH symptoms, which are influenced by changes in hormonal, inflammatory, growth factors, cell receptor signaling, diet, physical activity, and the microbiome of the prostate that leads to cellular proliferation. While current pharmaceutical or surgical treatments are currently available, each treatment has serious side effects. This dilemma has motived men to seek treatment without negative side effects from medicinal plants such as botanicals, phytochemicals, and vitamins that have established safety records. This narrative overview focuses on several botanicals, phytochemicals and vitamins that are widely used in the treatment of BPH and emphasizes how, in some cases, combinations of these natural ingredients may provide better BPH symptom relief compared to utilization of a single medicinal plant product (monotherapy). Finally, this overview highlights in vitro, in vivo animal studies and mainly clinical data of journal reports published in the past 5 years from January 2018 to January 2023 on BPH and nutraceuticals. Notably, there is an evolving perspective or rethinking of the role that medicinal phytochemicals and natural vitamins usage play; that is, they may hold promise or are likely to alleviate BPH symptoms.",

      "abstract": "There exists significant heterogeneity in the 'freshness' of consumer marine- and plant-derived omega-3 (Ω3) supplements. Fears of rancidity, or the oxidation of consumer Ω3 supplements, has been debated in the literature with several prior authors reporting contradictory findings. We report the peroxide value (PV), para-anisidine value (p-AV) and total oxidation values (TOTOX) associated with 72 consumer Ω3 supplements sold in the United States sampled from 2014-2020. The effect of flavoring on the oxidation of the supplements was examined in an adjusted fixed effects model controlling for type of delivery system (enteric, liquid, animal- and vegetable-derived gelatin softgel, spray), source (algae, calamari, fish, krill, mussels), and certifications assigned by third-party organizations (e.g. USP). Overall, our results revealed that 68% (23/34) of flavored and 13% (5/38) unflavored consumer Ω3 supplements exceeded the TOTOX upper limit set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA (GOED) voluntary monograph standard of ≤ 26, with 65% (22/34) flavored supplements and 32% (12/38) unflavored supplements failing the PV upper limit of ≤ 5 and 62% (21/34) flavored supplements exceeding the p-AV upper limit of ≤ 20. To our knowledge, no prior authors have modeled the impact of flavoring on oxidative status in 72 marine- and plant-derived Ω3 products sold in the U.S. We present our findings in this context and discuss the clinical implications related to the consumption of oxidized consumer fish oils and their effects on human health.",

      "abstract": "This article describes why the safety and efficacy assessment of non-nutrient bioactives for reducing chronic disease risk is so complicated, especially for dietary supplements and traditional medicines. Scientists, regulators, and the public have different and sometimes opposing perspectives about bioactives. Drug, food, and traditional medicine models used for bioactive safety assessment are based on different assumptions and use different processes. Efficacy assessment is seldom based on clinical trials of boactives' effects in reducing chronic disease risk. It usually consists of application of quality assurance measures and evaluation of label claims and commercial speech about ingredients or products to ensure conformity to regulations. Harmonization of safety and efficacy assessment on a global basis is difficult because of differences within and between regulatory systems. The recommendations provided may open the way for bioactives to play a larger health role in the future, fill gaps in data needed for crafting authoritative dietary guidance on intakes, and speed harmonization of global standards.",

Childhood is a critical period during which atherosclerosis may begin to develop; in the presence of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), the lifelong elevation of LDL cholesterol levels greatly accelerates atherosclerosis. Lowering LDL-C levels is associated with a well-documented reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. Current guidelines support the dietary and lifestyle approach as the primary strategy of intervention in children and adolescents with FH. Nutraceuticals (functional foods or dietary supplements of plant or microbial origin) are included in the EU guidelines as lifestyle interventions and may provide an additional contribution in reducing LDL levels when pharmacological therapy is not yet indicated. Meta-analyses of randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that the same nutraceuticals improve lipid profile, including lowering LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In this narrative review, starting from current scientific evidence, we analyse the benefits and limitations of the nutraceuticals in children and adolescents with dyslipidaemia, and we try to evaluate their use and safety in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Seaweeds or algae are marine autotrophic organisms. They produce nutrients (e.g., proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) essential for the survival of living organisms as they participate in biochemical processes and non-nutritive molecules (such as dietary fibers and secondary metabolites), which can improve their physiological functions. Seaweed polysaccharides, fatty acids, peptides, terpenoids, pigments, and polyphenols have biological properties that can be used to develop food supplements and nutricosmetic products as they can act as antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory compounds. This review examines the (primary and secondary) metabolites produced by algae, the most recent evidence of their effect on human health conditions, with particular attention to what concerns the skin and hair's well-being. It also evaluates the industrial potential of recovering these metabolites from biomass produced by algae used to clean wastewater. The results demonstrate that algae can be considered a natural source of bioactive molecules for well-being formulations. The primary and secondary metabolites' upcycling can be an exciting opportunity to safeguard the planet (promoting a circular economy) and, at the same time, obtain low-cost bioactive molecules for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries from low-cost, raw, and renewable materials. Today's lack of methodologies for recovering bioactive molecules in large-scale processes limits practical realization.",

      "title": "Downstream Processing of Medicinal Mushroom Products.",
      "abstract": "Medicinal mushrooms are higher fungi that consist of ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and imperfect fungi. They have been long used as tonic and traditional medicine in East Asia, Europe, and Africa. Contemporary pharmacological researches have revealed that they possess a wide spectrum of bioactivity due to their production of a variety of bioactive compounds. Some of them have entered into the market; some are ready for industrial trials and further commercialization, while others are in various stages of development. According to the purpose of usage, a variety of medicinal mushroom-based products have been developed, which could be roughly divided into three general categories, i.e., nutraceuticals/functional foods, nutriceuticals/dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals. Accordingly, the downstream processing of medicinal mushroom products varies greatly. Indeed, a major characteristic of medicinal mushroom is the wide variety of secondary metabolites, due to which a broad spectrum of separation techniques must be employed. In this chapter we will present an overview of the achievements in downstream processing technology for medicinal mushroom products. Examples of separation of products such as bioactive high-molecular-weight products like polysaccharides and low-molecular-weight products like triterpenoids are given. The application of some special separation strategy, e.g., chemical reaction-assisted separation for tackling some analogs with similar physicochemical properties from medicinal mushroom, is also described.",

      "abstract": "In the post-genomic era, the data provided by complete genome sequencing could not answer several fundamental questions about the causes of many noninfectious diseases, diagnostic biomarkers, and novel therapeutic approaches. The rapidly expanding understanding of epigenetic mechanisms, as well as widespread acceptance of their hypothesized role in disease induction, facilitated the development of a number of novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic concepts. Epigenetic aberrations are reversible in nature, which enables the treatment of serious incurable diseases. Therefore, the interest in epigenetic modulatory effects has increased over the last decade, so about 60,000 publications discussing the expression of epigenetics could be detected in the PubMed database. Out of these, 58,442 were published alone in the last 10 years, including 17,672 reviews (69 historical articles), 314 clinical trials, 202 case reports, 197 meta-analyses, 156 letters to the editor, 108 randomized controlled trials, 87 observation studies, 40 book chapters, 22 published lectures, and 2 clinical trial protocols. The remaining publications are either miscellaneous or a mixture of the previously mentioned items. According to the species and gender, the publications included 44,589 human studies (17,106 females, 14,509 males, and the gender is not mentioned in the remaining papers) and 30,253 animal studies. In the present work, the role of epigenetic modulations in health and disease and the influencing factors in epigenetics are discussed.",

We discuss the need of designing healthy products based on stressed fresh produce and by-products and present a pragmatic strategy to enhance nutraceuticals in plants, and finally we propose designing appropriate studies with stressed plants targeting immunomodulatory properties to determine preventive and therapeutic effects against chronic diseases and the appropriate recommended dose.",

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals are defined as products isolated or purified from foods that are generally sold in medicinal or dosage forms not usually associated with food which is demonstrated to have a physiological benefit or provide protection against chronic disease. In this context, the products offered should be rigorously evaluated by international regulatory agencies. More recently, nutraceuticals have been proposed as a potential preventive and therapeutic option in the assessment of chronic diseases, mainly by altering the microbiome composition. However, the current lack of conclusive evidence supporting the \"healthy\" or \"normal\" microbiome, along with the dysbiosis concept paradigm, could be both contributing to the lack of homogeneous results. These issues may be solved in the next years with the use of emergent technologies in the individual's microbiome assessment and its fluctuations in time or related to many factors, such as nutraceuticals. Additionally, future research assessing the independent association between the dysbiosis modification and any \"potential\" nutraceutical product (including bioactive ingredient or chemical compound in food) is going to enlarge the currently reduced \"established nutraceuticals\" group. In this work we have assessed the nutraceutical's potential role as a microbiome-targeted manipulation therapy, and the gut-liver axis involved in the digestive diseases' pathogenesis and progression, including the chronic liver diseases. Moreover, microbiome targeted nutraceuticals that show consistent results might be further included in clinical research and trials in the therapeutic assessment of chronic diseases. Finally, the indication of these quality microbiome-targeted nutraceuticals will undoubtedly carry health benefits for individuals.",

The mouth is a window into the body's health, and nutrition can strongly impact the state of general and oral health. A healthy diet involves the synergistic effect of various nutraceutical agents, potentially capable of conferring protective actions against some inflammatory and chronic-degenerative disorders. Nutraceuticals, mostly present in plant-derived products, present multiple potential clinical, preventive, and therapeutic benefits. Accordingly, preclinical and epidemiological studies suggested a protective role for these compounds, but their real preventive and therapeutic effects in humans still await confirmation. Available evidence suggests that plant extracts are more effective than individual constituents because they contain different phytochemicals with multiple pharmacological targets and additive/synergistic effects, maximizing the benefits for oral health. Moreover, nutritional recommendations for oral health should be personalized and aligned with valid suggestions for overall health. This review is aimed to: introduce the basic concepts of nutraceuticals, including their main food sources; examine the logic that supports their relationship with oral health, and summarize and critically discuss clinical trials testing the utility of nutraceuticals in the prevention and treatment of oral diseases.",

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals are bioactive or chemical compounds acclaimed for their valuable biological activities and health-promoting effects. The global community is faced with many health concerns such as cancers, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, etc. The effect of nutraceuticals is similar to pharmaceuticals, even though the term nutraceutical has no regulatory definition. The usage of nutraceuticals, to prevent and treat the aforementioned diseases, is limited by several features such as poor water solubility, low bioavailability, low stability, low permeability, low efficacy, etc. These downsides can be overcome by the application of the field of nanotechnology manipulating the properties and structures of materials at the nanometer scale. In this review, the linear and cyclic dextrin, formed during the enzymatic degradation of starch, are highlighted as highly promising nanomaterials- based drug delivery systems. The modified cyclic dextrin, cyclodextrin (CD)-based nanosponges (NSs), are well-known delivery systems of several nutraceuticals such as quercetin, curcumin, resveratrol, thyme essential oil, melatonin, and appear as a more advanced drug delivery system than modified linear dextrin. CD-based NSs prolong and control the nutraceuticals release, and display higher biocompatibility, stability, and solubility of poorly water-soluble nutraceuticals than the CD-inclusion complexes, or uncomplexed nutraceuticals. In addition, the well-explored CD-based NSs pathways, as drug delivery systems, are described. Although important progress is made in drug delivery, all the findings will serve as a source for the use of CD-based nanosystems for nutraceutical delivery. To sum up, our review introduces the extensive literature about the nutraceutical concepts, synthesis, characterization, and applications of the CD-based nano delivery systems that will further contribute to the nutraceutical delivery with more potent nanosystems based on linear dextrins.",

Thraustochytrids, which are marine oleaginous protists, are known for their production of bioactives with significant applications in nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and aquaculture. A wide range of high-value biochemicals, such as nutritional supplements (omega-3 fatty acids), squalene, exopolysaccharides (EPSs), enzymes, aquaculture feed, and biodiesel and pigment compounds, have been investigated. We discuss thraustochytrids as potential feedstocks to produce various bioactive compounds and advocate developing a biorefinery to offset production costs. We anticipate that future advances in cell manufacturing, lipidomic analysis, and nanotechnology-guided lipid extraction would facilitate large-scale cost-competitive production through these microbes.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are common among aging populations around the globe. Most are characterized by loss of neurons, protein aggregates, oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, neuroinflammation among others. Although symptomatic treatment using conventional pharmacotherapy has been widely employed, their therapeutic success is limited due to varied reasons. In the need to identify an alternative approach, researchers successfully demonstrated the therapeutic utility of plant-derived nutraceuticals in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative conditions. However, most nutraceuticals failed during clinical trials in humans owing to their poor bioavailability in vivo and limited permeability across the blood brain barrier (BBB). The current emphasis is therefore on the improved delivery of nutraceuticals to the brain. In this regard, development of nanoparticle conjugated nutraceuticals to enhance bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy in the brain has gained attention. Here, we review the research advances in nanoparticles conjugated nutraceuticals applied in neurodegenerative disorders and discuss their advantages and limitations, clinical trials and toxicity concerns.",

      "abstract": "Amorphous solid products have recently gained a lot of attention as key solutions to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble nutraceuticals. A pure amorphous drug is a high-energy form; physically/chemically unstable and so easily gets recrystallized into the less soluble crystalline form limiting solubility and bioavailability issues. Amorphous solid dispersion and co-amorphous are new formulation approach that stabilized unstable amorphous form through different mechanisms such as preventing mobility, high glass transition temperature and molecular interaction. Nutraceuticals have been received the utmost importance due to their health benefits. However, most of these compounds have been associated with poor oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, high lipophilicity, high melting point, poor permeability, degradability and rapid metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) which limits its health benefits. This review provides us a systematic application of amorphous systems to the delivery of poorly soluble nutraceuticals, with the aim of overcoming their pharmacokinetic limitations and improved pharmacological potential. In particular, it describes the challenges associated with delivery of oral nutraceuticals, various methods involved in the preparation and characterization of amorphous systems and permeability enhancement of nutraceuticals are in detail.",

      "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) mainly affecting the colon and the rectum. Its main characteristics include relapsing and remitting mucosal inflammation, starting in the rectum and typically extending continuously proximally through part of or the entire colon. UC pathogenesis depends on multiple factors, such as genetic predisposition, defects in the epithelial barrier, dysregulated immune responses, and environmental causes. The most frequent symptoms are abdominal pain, weight loss, mucus discharge, bloody diarrhoea, incontinence, nocturnal defecations, fever, and anemia. Existing therapies for UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its derivatives, steroids, immunosuppressants, and biological drugs. However, limited efficacy and unwanted adverse effects hardly limit these strategies of treatment. In the last decades, research studies have been driven towards complementary and alternative medicines for the treatment of UC. Various nutraceuticals have exhibited promising results in modulating intestinal inflammation while improving symptoms. These compounds possess a wide spectrum of positive health effects evidenced by in vitro studies, characterized by their involvement in antioxidant defenses, cell proliferation, and gene expression. The present review analyzes the available data about the different types of nutraceuticals and their potential effectiveness as adjuvant therapy of IBD, with particular emphasis to UC.",

It is a safe, well-studied supplement for strength training. Previous studies have shown that supplementation increases brain creatine levels, which might increase cognitive performance. The results of studies that have tested cognitive performance differ greatly, possibly due to different populations, supplementation regimens, and cognitive tasks.

      "abstract": "Protein powders, including those containing herbal and dietary supplements such as vitamins, minerals, and other natural or synthetic ingredients, can be associated with hepatotoxicity. Protein supplements are often mislabeled and deceptive in their contents. In this self-funded transparent study, we extensively analyzed popular protein supplements in India to identify potential hepatotoxic substances based on industrial standards. All products underwent extensive analysis, including total protein content, fungal aflatoxin detection, pesticide residue estimation, heavy metal quantification, steroid detection, and complete organic and inorganic profiling, according to industry standards. Most protein supplements did not meet the labeled and advertised protein content, while certain brands surpassed the stated levels, raising concerns about potential \"protein/amino-spiking.\" In addition, the major brands contained detectable fungal toxins and pesticide residues. Furthermore, many major formulations contained harmful heavy metals such as lead and arsenic, and some featured hepatoxic herbal extracts, particularly green tea extract, turmeric, Garcinia cambogia, and Ashwagandha. Indian-made products were inferior to those manufactured by multinational companies. The presence of various potentially toxic compounds, such as cycloheptatriene, benzene derivatives, toluene, and isopropyl alcohol, within a nonstandardized and unregulated diverse ingredient mix added to the overall concern. We demonstrate that the protein-based herbal and dietary supplement industry requires stringent scrutiny, regulation, and basic safety studies before being marketed. Manufacturers must consider reducing \"ingredient complexities\" of their protein powders to prevent adverse interactions between herbal and nonherbal components in consumers. Manufacturers must avoid using known toxic ingredients to reduce the avoidable disease burden within the public community.",

Unlike traditional antibiotics, they can be utilized on a continual basis without leading to the development of resistance. The veterinary IgY antibody market is growing because of the demand for minimal antibiotic use in animal production. IgY antibodies are not as strong as antibiotics for treating infections, but they work well as preventative agents and are natural, nontoxic, and easy to produce. They can be administered orally and are well tolerated, even by young animals. Unlike antibiotics, oral IgY supplements support the microbiome that plays a vital role in maintaining overall health, including immune system function. IgY formulations can be delivered as egg yolk powder and do not require extensive purification. Lipids in IgY supplements improve antibody stability in the digestive tract. Given this, using IgY antibodies as an alternative to antimicrobials has garnered interest. In this review, we will examine their antibacterial potential.",

      "abstract": "Polyphenols are secondary metabolites produced by plants, which contribute to the plant's defense against abiotic stress conditions (e.g., UV radiation and precipitation), the aggression of herbivores, and plant pathogens. Epidemiological studies suggest that long-term consumption of plant polyphenols protects against cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Their structural diversity has fascinated and confronted analytical chemists on how to carry out unambiguous identification, exhaustive recovery from plants and organic waste, and define their nutritional and biological potential. The food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries employ polyphenols from fruits and vegetables to produce additives, additional foods, and supplements. In some cases, nanocarriers have been used to protect polyphenols during food processing, to solve the issues related to low water solubility, to transport them to the site of action, and improve their bioavailability. This review summarizes the structure-bioactivity relationships, processing parameters that impact polyphenol stability and bioavailability, the research progress in nanocarrier delivery, and the most innovative methodologies for the exhaustive recovery of polyphenols from plant and agri-waste materials.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of organic micromineral zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol supplementation in late-phase laying hens' diets on performance, egg quality, lipid stability of fresh and stored eggs, and bone quality. The treatments were a basal diet and diets supplemented with 32 mg Zn-Met/kg diet; 26 mg Mn-Met/kg diet; 32 mg Zn-Met/kg diet and 26 mg Mn-Met/kg diet; 1500 IU 25-hydroxycholecalciferol/kg diet; 32 mg Zn-Met/kg diet; 26 mg Mn-Met/kg diet; and 1500 IU 25-hydroxycholecalciferol/kg diet. On performance, the birds supplemented with organic manganese had the lowest feed intake. Regarding egg quality, the birds supplemented with Zn-Met and Mn-Met, with 25-hydroxycholecalciferol alone, and with Zn-Met, Mn-Met and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol presented a greater eggshell thickness than those receiving the basal diet. Lipid stability of the yolk varied only according to storage time. No effect of supplementation was observed on bone quality. Supplementation with Zn-Met and Mn-Met, or associated with 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxycholecalciferol alone, improved eggshell thickness in aged white layers. However, the associated or isolated supplementation with these nutrients did not influence performance, lipid stability of fresh and stored egg yolk or bone quality.",

      "abstract": "Nutraceuticals are food or component of food that do not only promote health but also help in recovering and combating health disorders. Algae are microorganisms that are used as supplements used in treating health disorders. They are rich in essential fatty acids, antioxidant pigments, and other micronutrients. These algae are gaining importance as functional components in the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles and applications in fabrics incorporated antimicrobial agents and pharmaceuticals. The present review focus on the distinctive algal components that are beneficial in biomedical applications. It also focuses on the research techniques to enrich the macronutrients and micronutrients by altering growth conditions and susceptible nutritional factors. A diagram model for a systematic review is utilized for this search. The research is conducted through the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Science Direct. Results: Here in this review, current reviewers put forward the importance of microalgae and other algae as alternative marine nutrient sources of dietary supplements for human consumption. In this context, extrinsic and intrinsic environmental parameter manipulative studies by eminent research groups to enhance the nutrient composition of these marine creatures are focused on in this study. Some costeffective approach-based techniques for industrial output have also been manifested. The role of algae as bio-inspired material for the production of biosynthetic metal nanoparticles, water-soluble polymers, bioplastic, antimicrobials, antifouling agents has been incurred as research interests in the past decades. In spite of being so impressive as nutraceuticals and bio-inspired material components, research gaps still exist. The purpose of the manuscript is to cover such gaps and show a new paradigm of biomedical applications.",

      "abstract": "Mineral nutrition plays a critical role in growth and bone mineralization in meat ducks as well as reproductive performance in duck layers and duck breeders. In addition to improving production performance parameters, minerals are also essential to support several enzymatic systems to enhancing antioxidant ability and immune function. This review explores the biological function and metabolism of minerals in the body, as well as mineral feeding strategy of various species of ducks. Topics range from mineral requirement to the physiological role of macroelements such as calcium and phosphorus and microelements such as zinc and selenium, etc. As with the improvement of genetic evolution and upgrade of rearing system in duck production, mineral requirements and electrolyte balance are urgent to be re-evaluated using sensitive biomarkers for the modern duck breed characterized by the rapid growth rate and inadequate bone development and mineralization. For duck breeders, mineral nutrition is not only required for maximal egg production performance but also for maintaining normal embryonic development and offspring's performance. Therefore, the proper amounts of bioavailable minerals need to be supplemented to maintain the mineral nutritional state of duck species during all phases of life. In addition, more positive effects of high doses microelements supplementations have been revealed for modern meat ducks subjected to various stresses in commercial production. The nutritional factors of mineral sources, supplemental enzymes, and antinutritional factors from unconventional ingredients should be emphasized to improve the effectiveness of mineral nutrition in duck feed formulation. Organic mineral sources and phytase enzymes have been adopted to reduce the antagonistic action between mineral and antinutritional factors. Therefore, special and accurate database of mineral requirements should be established for special genotypes of ducks under different rearing conditions, including rearing factors, environmental stresses and diets supplemented with organic sources, phytase and VD",

Inevitably, public health and safety measures could be undertaken in order to dwindle the infection threat and mortality. Moreover, to overcome the global menace and drawing out world from moribund stage, there is an exigency for social distancing and quarantines. Since December, 2019, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have came into existence and up till now world is still in the state of shock.At this point of time, COVID-19 has entered perilous phase, creating havoc among individuals, and this has been directly implied due to enhanced globalisation and ability of the virus to acclimatize at all conditions. The unabated transmission is due to lack of drugs, vaccines and therapeutics against this viral outbreak. But research is still underway to formulate the vaccines or drugs by this means, as scientific communities are continuously working to unravel the pharmacologically active compounds that might offer a new insight for curbing infections and pandemics. Therefore, the topical COVID-19 situation highlights an immediate need for effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Towards this effort, the present review discusses the vital concepts related to COVID-19, in terms of its origin, transmission, clinical aspects and diagnosis. However, here, we have formulated the novel concept hitherto, ancient means of traditional medicines or herbal plants to beat this pandemic.",

      "abstract": "Mineral supplementation has greater impact on male reproduction; however, the mechanism of action has not been studied in detail. The present study was aimed to deal with the lacuna in mechanism of action of mineral supplementation on improvement in sperm characteristics. A group of 40 bucks (aged 5 months) were assigned to 10 groups (4 in each group) based on their body weight and fed with concentrate mixture: basal roughage (minimal diet) in equal proportion to all the bucks. Among the 10 groups, one was considered as control, without any additional mineral supplementation, and the remaining 9 were treatment groups (3 groups each in Zn, Cu, and Zn + Cu). In treatment groups, organic Zn was fed in three different doses as 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg DM; organic Cu was fed in three different doses as 12.5, 25, and 37.5 mg/kg DM; and organic Zn + Cu was combinedly supplied as 20 + 12.5, 40 + 25, and 60 + 37.5 based on their mg/kg DM for 8 months period. The neat semen samples were processed for spermatozoal gene (stress- NOS3, HSP70, HIF1A; fertility- MTF1, MTA1, TIMP2, TNFa, and EGFR) expression studies through qRT-PCR and protein profile changes through single- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Significantly, the stress-responsive genes were downregulated, and fertility-related genes were upregulated in treatment groups. A significant correlation had been noticed among the genes studied: HIF1A with MTA1 (P < 0.05) and MTF1 with EGFR, TIMP2, TNFa, and NOS3 (P < 0.01) respectively. The organic Zn and Cu feeding modulated the expression of stress- and fertility-related genes and protein abundance, thereby improved the sperm characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Alkaloids are naturally occurring compounds with complex structures found in natural plants. To further improve the understanding of plant alkaloids, this review focuses on the classification, toxicity and mechanisms of action, providing insight into the occurrence of alkaloid-poisoning events and guiding the safe use of alkaloids in food, supplements and clinical applications. Based on their chemical structure, alkaloids can be divided into organic amines, diterpenoids, pyridines, isoquinolines, indoles, pyrrolidines, steroids, imidazoles and purines. The mechanisms of toxicity of alkaloids, including neurotoxicity, hepatoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity and cytotoxicity, have also been reviewed. Some cases of alkaloid poisoning have been introduced when used as food or clinically, including accidental food poisoning, excessive consumption, and poisoning caused by the improper use of alkaloids in a clinical setting, and the importance of safety evaluation was illustrated. This review summarizes the toxicity and mechanism of action of alkaloids and provides evidence for the need for the safe use of alkaloids in food, supplements and clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Genetically, modern broilers are fast-growing birds which attain the market age at the age of 5 weeks. To maintain optimum production, antibiotics have been commonly included in the diets as growth promoters. However, due to the increase in antimicrobial resistance, their uses have been banned worldwide. To keep the optimum level of production and health in broiler industry, the use of alternative growth promoters such as probiotics, prebiotics, enzymes, and organic acids has been proposed. Chemically, organic acids are weak acids and only partially dissociate. They are considered safe and have been used for preservation of food for centuries. Nowadays, organic acids have been reported for antibacterial, immune potentiating, and growth promoters in broilers. In this review, the effects of dietary inclusion of organic acids on growth, nutrient digestibility, intestinal integrity, immune system, and antibacterial activity in broilers are discussed.",

      "title": "Zinc and its binding proteins: essential roles and therapeutic potential.",
      "abstract": "Zinc is an essential micronutrient that participates in a multitude of cellular and biochemical processes. It is indispensable for normal growth and the maintenance of physiological functions. As one of the most significant trace elements in the body, zinc fulfills three primary biological roles: catalytic, structural, and regulatory. It serves as a cofactor in over 300 enzymes, and more than 3000 proteins require zinc, underscoring its crucial role in numerous physiological processes such as cell division and growth, immune function, tissue maintenance, as well as synthesis protein and collagen synthesis. Zinc deficiency has been linked to increased oxidative stress and inflammation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of diseases, like neurological disorders and cancer. In addition, zinc is a key constituent of zinc-binding proteins, which play a pivotal role in maintaining cellular zinc homeostasis. This review aims to update and expand upon the understanding of zinc biology, highlighting the fundamental roles of zinc in biological processes and the health implications of zinc deficiency. This work also explores the diverse functions of zinc in immune regulation, cellular growth, and neurological health, emphasizing the need for further research to fully elucidate the therapeutic potential of zinc supplementation in disease prevention and management.",

      "abstract": "Organic acid-based trace minerals are known to have more bioavailability, possibly due to fewer antagonism reactions in the lumen. A 42-day study was conducted to assess the supplementation of manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), and copper (Cu) from different sources. To that end, a total of 1248-day-old As-hatched Arbor Acres chickens were examined for performance, histology, bone integrity, and plasma biochemical parameters. Experimental groups were as follows: basal diet supplying 50, 75, 100, and 120% of trace mineral requirements using an inorganic trace mineral supplement (ITM50, ITM75, ITM100, ITM120); basal diet supplying 33, 66, and 100% of trace mineral requirements using an organic acid-based trace mineral supplement (OAT33, OAT66, OAT100); plus a basal diet supplying 100% of trace mineral requirements using an amino acid-based chelated trace mineral supplement (ATM100%) as control positive. According to results, birds' fed OAT66 had the highest (P < 0.05) average daily body weight gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR). Feeding OAT66 increased (P < 0.05) villus length to crypt depth ratio, compared to OAT33 and ITM100 by 26% and 19%, respectively. The relative weight of the bursa enhanced by 22% in birds' receiving OAT supplement, compared to those received ITM supplement (P < 0.05). The plasma uric acid was reduced by 42% (P < 0.001) in birds fed with OAT66 and OAT100 when compared to those fed ITM50. Overall, our results indicated that the same performance could be achieved by using lower levels of organic trace minerals.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary supplementation of organic selenium (Se) and vitamin E for sows from 1st and 2nd parity order, without adiabatic cooling on physiological parameters, reproductive performance, milk composition, litter performance and blood concentrations of antioxidant enzymes. A total of 96 sows were allotted in a 4 × 2 completely factorial design, with 4 experimental groups and 2 parity orders (1st and 2nd). The experimental groups consisted of: ACCon-sows receiving adiabatic cooling and no dietary supplementation of organic Se and vitamin E; WACCon-sows without adiabatic cooling and no dietary supplementation of organic Se and vitamin E; WACSe-sows without adiabatic cooling with dietary supplementation of 0.3 mg/kg organic Se; WACSeE-sows without adiabatic cooling with dietary supplementation of 0.3 mg/kg organic Se and 90 UI of vitamin E. ACCon Sows had lower respiratory rate, rectal temperature and body surface temperature when compared to the others sows (p < 0.05). Sows without evaporative cooling had lower daily milk production and weaned litters with lower weight and average daily gain when compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). ACCon sows presented higher weaned piglets to WACSeE sows. WACSeE Sows had higher concentrations of GSH-Px when compared to other experimental groups and higher levels of SOD than sows from ACCon and WACSe. Piglets of sows from WACSeE group presented higher levels of GSH-Px and SOD when compared to the other experimental groups. ACCon sows have higher milk yield and higher litter weight than others groups. Under equatorial climate conditions, dietary supplementation of organic Se and vitamin E from first and second parity order sows does not respond efficiently on thermoregulatory physiology and performance compared to adiabatic cooling, but modulates the enzymatic antioxidant balance of sows and piglets.",

      "title": "Nutraceutical Interventions for Mitigating Skin Ageing: Analysis of Mechanisms and Efficacy.",
      "abstract": "Skin ageing is influenced by intrinsic factors such as genetics and hormones, as well as extrinsic factors like environmental exposure, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and diet. These factors lead to biochemical, biological, and structural changes in the skin. Plant-derived compounds with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have emerged as potential anti-ageing agents. This comprehensive review, spanning data from 1997 to 2024, explores the role of nutraceuticals in skin anti-ageing. The research data were drawn from Google, PubMed, PubMed Central, Scopus, and various journal databases, including ScienceDirect, Springer, and Taylor & Francis. This review specifically examines plant-derived polyphenols, carotenoids, and other bioactive compounds, analysing their mechanisms through signalling pathways and cellular processes, using data from in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Polyphenols like quercetin, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, helping to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, UV-induced collagen degradation, and inflammatory cytokines. Notably, curcumin enhances collagen production and decreases the number of senescent cells. Carotenoids such as β-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, and lycopene protect against UV damage, and lycopene-rich tomato paste was specifically noted for its ability to reduce erythema and DNA damage. Additionally, compounds like resveratrol, fisetin, and wogonin exert protective effects against oxidative stress and inflammation, with resveratrol improving collagen synthesis and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. These plant-derived compounds can effectively combat skin ageing through various mechanisms, including the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation, and extracellular matrix degradation. They present a natural and sustainable approach to skincare in accord with the growing trend of conscious consumption. Future research should focus on understanding the long-term effects and determining the optimal dosage for clinical applications, highlighting the potential of integrating plant-based nutraceuticals into skincare regimens.",

      "abstract": "The nutritional status of a patient can be critical for the efficacy of other pharmaceuticals, especially organic antibiotics, to treat viral pandemics. There may be political and scientific difficulties in achieving a constructive synergy of nutritional and prescribed allopathic remedies. For adequate treatment, timelines may need to extend well beyond eliminating viral proliferation, e.g., with vaccines, to include the goals of (a) reducing post-viral fatigue, (b) promoting earliest recovery, and (c) future resistance in often poorly nourished patients, e.g., obese (!). Many trace minerals (TM) and vitamins may need to be replenished. This review focusses only upon zinc to illustrate some problems in rectifying these TM deficiencies affecting the balance between continued ill-health ('illth') or regaining optimal physical and mental wellbeing. Ultimately, this is a matter of behaviour, lifestyle, and informed choice(s). See Hetzel and McMichael 1959.",

      "abstract": "Scientific evidence increasingly supports the strong link between diet and health, acknowledging that a well-balanced diet plays a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and certain types of cancer. This perspective opens the door to developing precision diets, particularly tailored for individuals at risk of developing cancer. It encompasses a vast research area and involves the study of an expanding array of compounds with multilevel \"omics\" compositions, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, miRNomics, and metabolomics. We review here the components of the Southern European Atlantic Diet (SEAD) from both a chemical and pharmacological standpoint. The information sources consulted, complemented by crystallographic data from the Protein Data Bank, establish a direct link between the SEAD and its anticancer properties. The data collected strongly suggest that SEAD offers an exceptionally healthy profile, particularly due to the presence of beneficial biomolecules in its foods. The inclusion of olive oil and paprika in this diet provides numerous health benefits, and scientific evidence supports the anticancer properties of dietary supplements with biomolecules sourced from vegetables of the brassica genus. Nonetheless, further research is warranted in this field to gain deeper insights into the potential benefits of the SEAD's bioactive compounds against cancer.",

      "abstract": "Microorganisms, fermentation processes, and the resultant metabolic products are a key driving force in biotechnology and, in particular, in food biotechnology. The quantity and/or quality of final manufactured food products are directly related to the efficiency of the metabolic processes of producer microorganisms. Food BioTech companies are naturally interested in increasing the productivity of their biotechnological production lines. This could be achieved via either indirect or direct influence on the fundamental mechanisms governing biological processes occurring in microbial cells. This review considers an approach to improve the efficiency of producer microorganisms through the use of several types of substances or complexes affecting the metabolic processes of microbial producers that are of interest for food biotechnology, particularly fermented milk products. A classification of these supplements will be given, depending on their chemical nature (poly- and oligosaccharides; poly- and oligopeptides, individual amino acids; miscellaneous substances, including vitamins and other organic compounds, minerals, and multicomponent supplements), and the approved results of their application will be comprehensively surveyed.",

      "abstract": "Iodine is an essential microelement for humans and its deficiency leads to iodine deficiency disorder (IDD) which is a common problem faced by people in hilly areas. Biofortification of iodine is an option to overcome the IDD problem. Herein, we investigated the iodine uptake and accumulation in the edible portion of vegetables such as Brassica napus (BNP) and Brassica pekinensis (BPK) which were grown on two different soils such as sandy soil (SS) and silty loam soil (SLS) with different concentrations of iodine application (used in sodium iodide form) such as 0 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm. The concentration of iodine was determined by the oxidation of iodide, and nutrients were examined by double acid digestion. Different concentrations of iodine were noticed in silty loam and sandy soils, roots, and shoots of BNP and BPK, while the concentration follows the order: soils > roots > shoots. Iodine concentrations in the roots of BNP and BPK ranged from 46 to 223.7 μg/g which shows a strong correlation with other soil nutrients. Moreover, a large amount of iodine was lost due to the leaching. It is concluded that the biofortification of iodine increases its concentration in Brassica species. This work provides a reference for the iodine biofortification in plant species which will be helpful to control IDD.",

      "abstract": "Bee products have garnered considerable interest due to their abundant nutritional content and versatile biological activities. The utilization of bee products as fermentation materials has shown favorable potential for increasing nutrients, altering texture, and endorsing unique tastes. This review critically examines the existing literature on fermented bee products, with a specific emphasis on the impact of fermentation on their nutritional composition and potential health benefits. The raw materials, strains, conditions, and methodologies employed in the fermentation of bee products, as well as the utilization of bee products as fermentation raw materials/excipients, are reviewed. We also present a special focus on the nutritional composition and content of bioactive substances, such as polyphenols and volatile organic compounds, in fermented bee products. Additionally, the influence of fermentation on bee product ingredients and their health benefits is summarized. Fermented bee products substantially benefit human health, with superior antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-allergic properties compared to non-fermented bee products. Finally, this article discusses the types, strains, health benefits, production processes, and market prospects of fermented bee products, which are expected to become an important part of human food culture as functional food or nutritional supplements. The aforementioned findings highlight the remarkable nutritional value and bioactive properties exhibited by fermented bee products.",

      "abstract": "In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of nutraceuticals and biotics in both pediatric and adult clinical practice. The overlapping and often ambiguous symptoms of both functional and organic gastrointestinal disorders have led to a search for alternative therapeutic approaches that avoid the use of synthetic or chemical treatments. However, while nutraceuticals and natural supplements are widely used, their health benefits are often not supported by adequate scientific evidence, and an unregulated use of nutraceuticals can be potentially harmful. The correct use of nutraceuticals, prebiotics, and probiotics can optimize the results of drug therapy in some cases and reduce the risk of side effects. This review aims to provide clinicians with guidance on the use of complementary therapies for pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, highlighting the scarcity of studies on the kinetics and dynamics of nutraceuticals and biotics. While it is generally difficult to associate their intakes with adverse events due to the often-coexisting pharmacological treatments, it is essential to avoid the abandonment of traditional drugs with proven efficacy in the treatment of single diseases. Overall, the use of nutraceuticals, prebiotics, and probiotics in pediatric gastroenterological practice requires caution and medical supervision. Further research is needed to determine the effects of alternative therapies on pediatric gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders, and to ensure their safe and effective use in the clinical practice.",

Strong evidence of carcinogenicity of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) have been provided in animal and human studies, but the target organ of occurring cancer in human including bladder cancer is still obscure. A wide range of NOCs sources surrounded us like diet, drinking water, cigarette smoking, workplace, and indoor air population. We conducted a meta-analysis to elucidate the association between NOCs in drinking water and food source and bladder cancer risk. Ten articles were included after removing the duplicates and irrelevant articles. The majority studies of our meta-analysis was done on women, maybe because of cigarette smoking as a main risk factor among men which is more common among men than women. Although the number of articles was limited our meta-analysis showed no significant association between dietary intakes of NOCs and bladder cancer risk (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.88, 1.05; I2 = 50%, P-value = 0.007), neither subgrouping of NOCS type and source of NOCs nor dose of nitrate and nitrite intake indicated any associations.",

In addition to the abundance of evidence supporting the ergogenic benefits of creatine supplementation, recent evidence suggests a far broader application for creatine within various myopathies, neurodegenerative diseases, and other pathologies. Furthermore, creatine has been found to exhibit non-energy related properties, contributing as a possible direct and in-direct antioxidant and eliciting anti-inflammatory effects. In spite of the new clinical success of supplemental creatine, there is little scientific insight into the potential effects of creatine on cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality. Taking into consideration the non-energy related actions of creatine, highlighted in this review, it can be speculated that creatine supplementation may serve as an adjuvant therapy for the management of vascular health in at-risk populations. This review, therefore, not only aims to summarize the current literature surrounding creatine and vascular health, but to also shed light onto the potential mechanisms in which creatine may be able to serve as a beneficial supplement capable of imparting vascular-protective properties and promoting vascular health.",

      "title": "Underutilized Northern plant sources and technological aspects for recovering their polyphenols.",
      "abstract": "Consumers worldwide are increasingly interested in the authenticity and naturalness of products. At the same time, the food, agricultural and forest industries generate large quantities of sidestreams that are not effectively utilized. However, these raw materials are rich and inexpensive sources of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols. The exploitation of these raw materials increases income for producers and processors, while reducing transportation and waste management costs. Many Northern sidestreams and other underutilized raw materials are good sources of polyphenols. These include berry, apple, vegetable, softwood, and rapeseed sidestreams, as well as underutilized algae species. Berry sidestreams are especially good sources of various phenolic compounds. This chapter presents the properties of these raw materials, providing an overview of the techniques for refining these materials into functional polyphenol-rich ingredients. The focus is on economically and environmentally sound technologies suitable for the pre-treatment of the raw materials, the modification and recovery of the polyphenols, as well as the formulation and stabilization of the ingredients. For example, sprouting, fermentation, and enzyme technologies, as well as various traditional and novel extraction methods are discussed. Regarding the extraction technologies, this chapter focuses on safe and green technologies that do not use organic solvents. In addition, formulation and stabilization that aim to protect isolated polyphenols during storage and extend shelflife are reviewed. The formulated polyphenol-rich ingredients produced from underutilized renewable resources could be used as sustainable, active ingredients--for example, in food and nutraceutical industries.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the impact of inorganic and organic nitrogen on volatile compounds of cider, various levels (60, 150 and 240 mg N/L) of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) and amino acids mixture were added to apple juice before fermentation, respectively. The qualitative and quantitative of volatile substances were carried out by GC-MS. Further, sensory and electronic nose analysis was performed to analyze the aroma profile of cider. Both DAP and amino acids mixture promoted fermentation, significantly affected volatile compositions and increased perceived aromas of cider. Adding 60 mg N/L DAP significantly increased volatile compounds content, especially medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (MCFAEEs) and fatty acids (FAs), whereas higher alcohols and acetate esters concentrations were remarkably increased with 150 mg N/L amino acids supplementation. Partial least-squares (PLS) regression analysis suggested that MCFAEEs contributed the most to tropical fruity aroma. The study provides a theoretical foundation for high-quality cider brewing.",

      "title": "Oleocanthal supplemented diet improves renal damage and endothelial dysfunction in pristane-induced systemic lupus erythematosus in mice.",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multiorgan disorder with a deregulated immune-inflammatory response. Nutritional therapy has been considered a promising approach to SLE management. Oleocanthal (OLE), the main extra virgin olive oil (EVOO)-derived secoiridoid, has shown to regulate the immune-inflammatory response in various disease contexts; however, its possible beneficial effects on SLE remain unclear. This study sought to evaluate the effects of OLE enriched diet on renal damage and aortic endothelial dysfunction in murine pristane-induced SLE, focusing on the action mechanisms and signaling pathways involved. BALB/c mice were injected with pristane and fed with OLE supplemented diet (0.01 % (w/w)) for six months. Levels of cytokines were measured by ELISA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes. Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM immune complexes were examined by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. Thoracic aortas were used to evaluate endothelial dysfunction. Western blotting was employed to detect signaling pathways and oxidative-inflammatory-related mediators. Dietary OLE supplementation reduced Th1/Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokines production and alleviated renal damage by decreasing immunoglobulin complexes deposition, and inflammation-mediating enzymes expression. The mechanisms underlying these protective effects could be related to the regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/Haem oxygenase 1 (Nrf-2/HO-1), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), signal transducer and transcription activator of transcription (STAT-3), inflammasome and, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Also, dietary OLE improved aortic endothelial dysfunction and vascular reactivity, normalizing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, and NADPH oxidase-1 (NOX-1) overexpression. This study shows the immunomodulatory effects of OLE in an in vivo model of SLE by improving renal damage and regulating aortic endothelial dysfunction. These preliminary results provide OLE as a new therapeutic strategy in SLE management.",

      "title": "Technical integrative approaches to cheese whey valorization towards sustainable environment.",
      "abstract": "Whey, a byproduct of cheese production, is often treated as an industrial dairy waste. A large volume of this product is disposed of annually due to inadequate bioconversion approaches. With its high pollutant load, disposal without pretreatment has raised a lot of environmental concerns alerting the need to seek optimal methods for adequately extracting and utilizing its organic content. In recent years, several techniques for whey valorization have emerged which may serve as interventionary measures against its environmental effects after disposal. In this review, we discuss five major approaches, by which whey can be converted into eco-friendly products, to significantly cut whey wastage. The approaches to whey valorization are therefore examined under the following perspectives: whey as a raw material for the production of bioethanol and prebiotic oligosaccharides via β-galactosidase and microbe catalyzed reactions, for the production of refined lactose as an excipient for pharmaceutical purposes, and the clinical significance of whey hydrolysates and their antifungal activity in food processing.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the impact of compound organic acid (COA) and chlortetracycline (CTC) on serum biochemical parameters, intestinal health, and growth performance of weaned piglets. Twenty-four piglets (24 d of age) were randomly allocated into three treatments with eight replicate pens (one piglet per pen). Feed the basal diet or a diet containing 3,000 mg/kg COA or 75 mg/kg CTC, respectively. Results showed that both COA and CTC significantly increased average daily gain and reduced diarrhea rates (P < 0.05). They also upregulated serum total antioxidant capacity and downregulated serum interleukin (IL-10) levels (P < 0.05), increased crude protein digestibility and propionic acid concentration in the colon, and decreased spermidine and putrescine contents (P < 0.05). Intestinal microbiota analysis revealed that both COA and CTC increased the Shannon and Chao1 index and decreased the relative abundance of Blautia and Roseburia, but increased the relative abundance of Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1. Correlation analysis indicated that Clostridium-sensu-stricto-1 may be closely related to inflammation levels and microbial metabolites in piglets. Based on the results, COA may be a potential substitute for CTC to reduce antibiotic use and biogenic amine emission while improving piglet growth and intestinal health.",

The result showed that the feeding diets containing probiotics and organic acid significantly (P < 0.05) reduced yolk fat and yolk cholesterol and increased eggshell weight, egg index, yolk color score, Haugh unit, and protein content. However, egg weight, albumen weight, yolk weight, albumen index, yolk index, and water content were not significantly (P > 0.05) different. It is concluded that dietary supplementation of organic acid and probiotic derived from grass silage improved egg quality in terms of yolk color score, fat, and cholesterol content.",

      "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is a vital trace element in human beings and is essential for protection against oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the accumulation and antioxidant effects of two organic seleniums, L-selenomethionine (SM) and L-Se-methylselenocysteine (SMC), through in vivo and in vitro experiments. L02 cells were pretreated with 10 nM SM or SMC for 24 h, followed by exposure to 100 nM of H₂O₂. Cell viability, apoptosis, and antioxidant capacity were detected to evaluate SM and SMC's protective effect. Organic selenium (SM and SMC) and inorganic selenium (sodium selenite, SS) were compared in terms of their in vivo accumulation and antioxidant capacity when supplemented daily and subsequently deprived in SD rats. Our results show that SM or SMC pre-treatment could significantly prevent elevated apoptosis and declined antioxidant ability. We found that organic Se supplementation resulted in higher Se accumulation than inorganic Se in the liver and kidney. The antioxidant capacity of liver and kidney tissues from rats fed with either organic selenium was significantly improved and was higher than that of SS. In summary, this study suggests that organic selenium supplements are more effective in facilitating Se accumulation in liver and kidney, enhancing antioxidant capacities, thereby protecting cells from oxidative stress. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study compared the antioxidant capacity of sodium selenite, L-selenomethionine, and L-Se-methylselenocysteine in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that organic selenium has a stronger antioxidant capacity and that significant differences exist in its absorption and conversion in male and female rats. Our results provide theoretical guidance for dietary supplementation of selenium.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of advanced material science boosts novel chemical analytical technologies for effective pretreatment and sensitive sensing applications in the fields of environmental monitoring, food security, biomedicines, and human health. Ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) emerge as a class of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with electrically charged frames or pores as well as predesigned molecular and topological structures, large specific surface area, high crystallinity, and good stability. Benefiting from the pore size interception effect, electrostatic interaction, ion exchange, and recognizing group load, iCOFs exhibit the promising ability to extract specific analytes and enrich trace substances from samples for accurate analysis. On the other hand, the stimuli response of iCOFs and their composites to electrochemical, electric, or photo-irradiating sources endows them as potential transducers for biosensing, environmental analysis, surroundings monitoring, etc. In this review, we summarized the typical construction of iCOFs and focused on their rational structure design for analytical extraction/enrichment and sensing applications in recent years. The important role of iCOFs in the chemical analysis was fully highlighted. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of iCOF-based analytical technologies were also discussed, which may be beneficial to provide a solid foundation for further design and application of iCOFs.",

      "abstract": "Supplementation of feed with organic zinc (Zn) has long been discussed as an alternative to inorganic Zn in pigs, but its effects on growth performance are mixed. This meta-analysis was conducted to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the influence of organic Zn on the growth performance of weanling pigs, on the basis of average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed to gain ratio (F/G). We screened the PubMed and Web of Science databases (published before December 31, 2022; limited to English) systematically and contrasted organic Zn supplementation with inorganic Zn supplementation. There were 680 retrievals of studies, of which 16 (1389 pigs, 37 records) were eligible to analyze. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. The subgroup analysis was classified as organic Zn source (Zn-amino acid (Zn-AA), Zn-glycine (Zn-Gly), Zn-methionine (Zn-Met), Zn-Lysine (Zn-Lys), proteinate complex Zn (Zn-Pro), chitosan-Zn (Zn-CS) or Zn-lactate (Zn-Lac)) and Zn additive dose (low, medium, or high, i.e., lower than, equal to or higher than the requirement of NRC). Organic Zn addition in the weaning phase increased the ADG (P < 0.001) and the ADFI (P = 0.023) and decreased the F/G (P < 0.001). Specifically, for the organic sources, only Zn-CS supplementation presented significant effects on the ADG (P < 0.001), ADFI (P = 0.011), and F/G (P < 0.001). Moreover, medium-dose organic Zn supplementation had positive effects on ADG (P = 0.012), ADFI (P = 0.018), and F/G (P < 0.001). Our results indicate that organic Zn added to diets greatly improves the growth performance of weanling pigs.",

      "title": "Centennial Review: Trace mineral research with an emphasis on manganeseDedicated to Dr. Roland M. Leach, Jr.",
      "abstract": "A century of publications in the Poultry Science journal is celebrated with Centennial papers. It is relevant, therefore, to explore trace mineral (TM) research with an emphasis on manganese and selected aspects of skeletal development. Some of the initial observations on the topic appeared in the earliest volumes of our journal. Published studies in the late 1920's and 1930's confirmed the importance of the diet and unidentified organic (i.e., vitamins) and inorganic nutrients (i.e., TM) relative to skeletal development. The early nutrition research emphasized requirement studies, the search for unknown factors to alleviate recognized deficiencies, and lastly important nutrient interactions, especially in the gut. This review will discuss TM research with an emphasis on manganese (Mn). Some of the fundamental discoveries on the mechanisms underlying embryonic and post-hatch skeletal development led directly to research directed at the role of Mn in the synthesis of the epiphyseal matrix. The TM research agenda today is considerably different with respect to all trace nutrients and is largely driven by gut health, antibiotic free production, food safety and environmental outcomes. A significant proportion of the published research over the last 2 decades has focused on the form (i.e., organic, inorganic) of a given TM relative to a given physiologic or production response under the pretext that modern commercial genotypes and production realities have changed considerably since the last NRC publication (NRC, 1994). If one closely reviews the more recent scientific literature, however, it could be argued that the term \"trace mineral requirement\" is often a misnomer. Many of the TM levels recommended or in use today are not the result of quantifiable requirement studies but are often based on efficacy comparisons with the different organic and inorganic forms of commercially available TM.",

      "abstract": "Microalgae is a renewable bioresource with the potential to replace the conventional fossil-based industrial production of organic chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the microalgal biomass contains carotenoids, vitamins, and other biomolecules that are widely used as food supplements. However, the microalgal biomass production, their composition variations, energy-intensive harvesting methods, optimized bio-refinery routes, and lack of techno-economic analysis are the major bottleneck for the life-sized commercialization of this nascent bio-industry. This review discusses the microalgae-derived key bioactive compounds and their applications in different sectors for human health. Furthermore, this review proposes advanced strategies to enhance the productivity of bioactive compounds and highlight the key challenges associated with a safety issue for use of microalgae biomass. It also provides a detailed global scenario and market demand of microalgal bioproducts. In conclusion, this review will provide the concept of microalgal biorefinery to produce bioactive compounds at industrial scale platform for their application in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sector considering their current and future market trends.",

      "abstract": "Tau is a natively unfolded protein that contributes to the stability of microtubules. Under pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), tau protein misfolds and self-assembles to form paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments (SFs). Full-length tau protein assembles poorly and its self-assembly is enhanced with polyanions such as heparin and RNA in vitro, but a role for heparin or other polyanions in vivo remains unclear. Recently, a truncated form of tau (297-391) has been shown to self-assemble in the absence of additives which provides an alternative in vitro PHF model system. Here we describe methods to prepare in vitro PHFs and SFs from tau (297-391) named dGAE. We also discuss the range of biophysical/biochemical techniques used to monitor tau filament assembly and structure.",

The reactions take place under transition-metal-free conditions, employing odorless and convenient sulfur reagents. A wide variety of functional groups are tolerated in the S-diarylation, enabling the regioselective late-stage application of several heterocycles and drug molecules under mild reaction conditions. A novel S-difunctionalization pathway was discovered using vinyliodonium salts, which proceeds under additive-free reaction conditions and grants excellent stereoselectivity in the synthesis of aryl(vinyl) sulfides. A one-pot strategy combining transition-metal-free diarylation and subsequent reduction provided facile access to electron-rich thioanilines and a direct synthesis of a potential drug candidate derivative. The retained iodo group allows a wide array of further synthetic transformations. Mechanistic insights were elucidated by isolating the key intermediate, and the relevant energy profile was substantiated by DFT calculations.",

The influence of CMC molecular weight, degree of substitution and polymer concentration on solutions' viscoelastic properties is investigated.

      "abstract": "A simple and efficient method for the synthesis of diarylmethyl-functionalized anilines through the hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)-mediated regioselective 1,6-hydroarylation reaction of para-quinone methides (p-QMs) with anilines under catalyst- and additive-free conditions is reported. Various kinds of p-QMs and amines (e. g. primary, secondary and tertiary amines) are well tolerated in this transformation without the pre-protection of amino group, and the corresponding products could be generated with good to excellent yields and satisfactory regioselectivity under the optimized reaction conditions. In addition to adaptable amine compounds, indoles and their derivatives are also compatible with this reaction system. This transformation can be easily extended to a gram scale-synthesis level to synthesize the target product. Furthermore, it is worth noting that some complex small aniline molecules with biological activity can be selectively modified using this method. The possible reaction mechanism is proposed through the step-by-step control experiments and DFT calculations, showing that the key process for achieving the regioselective 1,6-hydroarylation of p-QMs is the hydrogen bonding effect of HFIP to substrates.",

      "abstract": "The democratization of thermoplastic 3D printing is rooted in the ease of processing enabled by economical melting and shaping. Thermosetting polymers, on the other hand, have not enjoyed this advantage given that thermosetting resins cannot hold their shape without cross-linking or excessive fillers, and once cross-linked, they cannot be extruded for printing. Due to this formidable challenge, thus far, 3D printing of thermosetting polymers has been limited to the photopolymerization of specialized photosensitive resins or extrusion of resins loaded with large fractions (as high as 20 wt %) of rheology modifiers. Here, we report a rheology-modifier- and photoinitiator-free process for the 3D printing of a pure commercial epoxy polymer, without any resin modification and using a conventional 3D printer. A low-cost non-Newtonian support material that switches between solid-fluid states under a nozzle shear stress enables the printing of complex 3D structures and the subsequent and ″one-step″ curing. Our results show that the one-step curing eliminates the often-compromised interlayer adhesion common in layer-by-layer 3D printing processes and results in unprecedented isotropic mechanical properties (strength, elastic modulus, tensile toughness, and strain to failure). This in-bath print and cure (IBPC) 3D printing process for thermosetting polymers is low-cost, scalable, high-speed (nozzle speeds exceeding 720 cm/min), and high-resolution (down to 220 μm filament size). We demonstrate potential applications for hobbyists, structural and aerospace components, and fiber-reinforced composites, among others.",

However, this process often generates substantial wood waste, leading to material inefficiency and increased production costs. A potential opportunity arises if complex wood structures can be created through additive processes. Here, we demonstrate an additive-free, water-based ink made of lignin and cellulose, the primary building blocks of natural wood, that can be used to three-dimensional (3D) print architecturally designed wood structures via direct ink writing. The resulting printed structures, after heat treatment, closely resemble the visual, textural, olfactory, and macro-anisotropic properties, including mechanical properties, of natural wood. Our results pave the way for 3D-printed wooden construction with a sustainable pathway to upcycle/recycle natural wood.",

      "abstract": "Accumulation of highly recalcitrant PP wastes has caused a serious environmental pollution. We evaluated the biodegradation of two types of additive-free PP polymers by microbial degraders from different environments. Two bacterial consortia, designated as PP1M and PP2G, were enriched from the ocean and from the guts of Tenebrio molitor larvae. Both consortia were able to utilize each of two different additive-free PP plastics with relatively low molecular weights (low molecular weight PP powder and amorphous PP pellets) as the sole carbon source for growth. After a 30-day incubation, several plastic characterization methods, including high-temperature gel permeation chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry, were used to characterize the PP samples. The bio-treated PP powder was covered with tight biofilms and extracellular secretions with significantly increased hydroxyl and carbonyl groups and slightly decreased methyl groups. This suggested that degradation and oxidation had occurred. The altered molecular weights and the increased melting enthalpy and average crystallinity of the bio-treated PP samples all suggested that both consortia preferred to depolymerize and degrade the fractions with molecular weights of ≤34 kDa and the amorphous phase fractions of the two types of PP. Furthermore, low molecular weight PP powder was more susceptible to bacterial degradation compared to amorphous PP pellets. This study provides a unique example of different types of additive-free PP degradation by different culturable bacteria from the ocean and insect guts as well as a feasibility of PP waste removal in different environments.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the catalyst- and additive-free C-C bond forming reactions reported mostly from the year 2005 to date. C-C bond forming reactions are highly important as large and complex organic molecules can be derived from simpler ones via these reactions. On the other hand, catalyst- and additive-free reactions are economical, environmentally friendly and less sensitive to air/moisture, allow easy separation of products and are operationally simple. Hence, a large number of research articles have been published in this area. Though a few reviews are available on the catalyst-free organic reactions, most of them were published a few years ago. The current review excludes catalysts as well as additives and is specific to only C-C bond formation. Besides many organic name reactions, catalyst/additive-free C-H functionalizations, coupling reactions and UV-visible-light-promoted reactions are also discussed. Undoubtedly, the contents of this review will motivate readers to do more novel work in this area which will accelerate the journey towards a sustainable future.",

      "abstract": "Sunlight transforms plastic into water-soluble products, the potential toxicity of which remains unresolved, particularly for vertebrate animals. We evaluated acute toxicity and gene expression in developing zebrafish larvae after 5 days of exposure to photoproduced (P) and dark (D) leachates from additive-free polyethylene (PE) film and consumer-grade, additive-containing, conventional, and recycled PE bags. Using a \"worst-case\" scenario, with plastic concentrations exceeding those found in natural waters, we observed no acute toxicity. However, at the molecular level, RNA sequencing revealed differences in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each leachate treatment: thousands of genes (5442 P, 577 D) for the additive-free film, tens of genes for the additive-containing conventional bag (14 P, 7 D), and none for the additive-containing recycled bag. Gene ontology enrichment analyses suggested that the additive-free PE leachates disrupted neuromuscular processes via biophysical signaling; this was most pronounced for the photoproduced leachates. We suggest that the fewer DEGs elicited by the leachates from conventional PE bags (and none from recycled bags) could be due to differences in photoproduced leachate composition caused by titanium dioxide-catalyzed reactions not present in the additive-free PE. This work demonstrates that the potential toxicity of plastic photoproducts can be product formulation-specific.",

      "title": "Producing vesicle-free cell culture additive for human cells extracellular vesicles manufacturing.",
      "abstract": "A new paradigm has emerged recently, which consists in shifting from cell therapy to a more flexible acellular \"extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy\" approach, thereby opening a new and promising field in nanomedicine. Important technical limitations have still to be addressed for the large-scale production of clinical-grade EV. Cells are cultured in media supplemented with human platelet lysate (hPL) (xenogenic-free) or GMP-grade fetal calf serum (FCS). However, these additives contain high amounts of EV that cannot be separated from cell-secreted -EV. Therefore, cells are generally maintained in additive-free medium during the EV secretion phase, however this can substantially limit their survival. In the present work, we developed a method to prepare vesicle-free hPL (EV-free hPL) or vesicle-free FCS (EV-free FCS) using tangential flow filtration (TFF). We show a very efficient EV depletion (>98%) for both pure hPL and FCS, with a highly conserved protein content. Culture medium containing our EV-free additives supported the survival of human bone marrow MSC (BM-MSC). MSC could survive at least 216 h, their conditioned medium being collected and changed every 72 h. Both the cell survival and the cumulative EV production were substantially higher than in the starving conditions classically used for EV production. In EV-free hPL containing medium, we show that purified EV kept their morphologic and molecular characteristics throughout the production. Finally, we tested our additives with 3 other cell types, human primary Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFC) and two non-adherent human cell lines, Jurkat and THP-1. We confirmed that both EV-free hPL and FCS were able to maintain cell survival and EV production for at least 216 h. Our method provides therefore a new option to help producing large amounts of EV from virtually any mammalian cells, particularly those that do not tolerate starvation. This method can apply to any animal serum for research and development purpose. Moreover, EV-free hPL is clinical-grade compatible and allows preparing xenobiotic-free media for massive therapeutic EV production in both 2D (cell plates) and 3D (bioreactor) setting.",

      "abstract": "The development and application of micropatterning technology play a promising role in the manipulation of biological substances and the exploration of life sciences at the microscale. However, the universally adaptable micropatterning method with user-friendly properties for acceptance in routine laboratories remains scarce. Herein, a green, facile, and rapid microcontact printing method is reported for upgrading popularization and diversification of biological patterning. The three-step printing can achieve high simplicity and fidelity of additive-free polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropatterning and chip fabrication within 8 min as well as keep their high stability and diversity. A detailed experimental report is provided to support the advanced microcontact printing method. Furthermore, the applications of easy-to-operate PDMS-patterned chips are extensively validated to complete microdroplet array assembly with spatial control, cell pattern formation with high efficiency and geometry customization, and microtissue assembly and biomimetic tumor construction on a large scale. This straightforward method promotes diverse micropatternings with minimal time, effort, and expertise and maximal biocompatibility, which might broaden its applications in interdisciplinary scientific communities. This work also offers an insight into the establishment of popularized and market-oriented microtools for biomedical purposes such as biosensing, organs on a chip, cancer research, and bioscreening.",

      "abstract": "Hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesives (HMPSAs) are used in applications from office supplies to biomedical adhesives. The major component in HMPSA formulations is thermoplastic elastomers, such as styrene-based block copolymers, that provide both mechanical integrity and moldability. Since neat polymer networks are unable to establish an adhesive bond, large quantities of plasticizers and tackifiers are added. These additives enhance the adhesive performance but complicate the phase behavior and property stability of the pressure-sensitive adhesive. Herein, we introduce an alternative additive-free approach to HMPSA design based on self-assembly of bottlebrush graft-copolymers, where side chains behave as softness, strength, and viscoelasticity mediators. These systems maintain moldability of conventional thermoplastic elastomers, while architecturally disentangled bottlebrush network strands empower several benefits such as extreme softness for substrate wetting, low melt viscosity for molding and 3D-printing, and a broad frequency range of viscoelastic responses for adhesion regulation within almost four orders of magnitude. The brush graft-copolymers implement five independently controlled architectural parameters to regulate the Rouse time, work of adhesion, and debonding mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "PLLA membranes with excellent ductility were successfully prepared by a simple solvent evaporation-induced precipitation method, without any additive. The excellent mechanical properties are mainly attributed to the interconnecting pore morphology and the plastic deformation of the pore wall during the stretching process. The interconnecting pore morphology is determined by delaying non-solvent diffusion and molecular chain pre-nucleation. It was found that the average pore size gradually decreased from 19.25 μm to 6.71 μm as the concentration of the polymer solution increased from 0.03 g/ml to 0.10 g/ml, and the elongation at break of the membrane can reach 130.8%. The crystallinity is between 33.4% and 44.5%, and the crystal form is a perfect α crystal. Membrane with interconnecting pore structure contributes to the formation of 91.2% porosity. Furthermore, the solvent evaporation-induced precipitation method can also form surfaces containing micro-nano structures which significantly improves surface hydrophobicity. The combination of high porosity and hydrophobicity makes the membrane potentially applicable to the field of oil-water separation.",

      "abstract": "Modern society is increasingly attracted with safe, natural, and additive-free food products, that gives preference to bacteriocins produced by General Recognized as Safe bacteria as a food preservative. Bacteriocins have been reported to be effective in extending shelf life of diverse foods such as meats, dairy products, wine, juice, and fruits and vegetables, whereas commercialized bacteriocins remain only nisin, pediocin, and Micocin. It is important that commercialized preservatives undergo an easy-to-handle manufacturing while maintaining high efficacy. Limited application of bacteriocins is most often caused by the absence of legislatives for use, low production, high cost and complicated purification process, reduced efficiency in the complex food matrix and insufficiently defined mechanism of action. Accordingly, this review provides an overview of bacteriocins, in relation to production stimulation, general purification scheme, impact of food matrix on bacteriocin effectiveness, and collaborative technology to improve bacteriocin performances. It is worth to note that purification and performance improvement technology remain the two challenging tasks in promoting bacteriocins as a widely used bio-preservative. Furthermore, this review for the first time divides bacteriocin receptors into specific classes (class I, II, III) and nonspecific class, to provide a basis for an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of action.",

The addition of lipophilic silicon moiety opens up new avenues for multi-disciplinary research with broad applications in both the medicinal and material sciences. However, adhering to the strict biocompatibility requirements, and achieving the introduction of labile silicon handle and high chemo-selectivity have been formidable. In this paper, we report silicon-based conjugating reagents including β-trialkylsilyl and silyl ether-tethered alkynones that selectively react with thiols under physiological conditions. The pH-neutral, metal-free and additive-free reaction yields stable products with broad substrate compatibility and full retention of silicon handles in most cases. Besides simple aliphatic and aromatic thiols, this approach is applicable in the labeling of thiols present in proteins, sugars and payloads, thereby expanding the toolbox of thiol conjugation.",

As the main contributor to isoindolinone synthesis, metal catalysis is associated with many drawbacks including essential use of toxic/precious metals and excessive additives, high reaction temperatures, specially predesigned starting materials, and long reaction times (typically 8-30 h). In this study, we developed a catalyst- and additive-free, minute-scale, and high-yield microdroplet method for tricomponent isoindolinone synthesis at mild temperatures.

In this study, we extracted high molecular weight keratin (HK) from human hair and transformed it into a hemostatic sponge with a well-interconnected pore structure using a foaming technique, freeze-drying, and oxidation cross-linking. By controlling the cross-linking degree, the resulting sponge demonstrated excellent liquid absorption ability, shape recovery characteristics, and robust mechanical properties. The HK10 sponge exhibited rapid liquid absorption, expanding up to 600% within 5 s. Moreover, the HK sponge showed superior platelet activation and blood cell adhesion capabilities. In SD rat liver defect models, the sponges demonstrated excellent hemostatic performance by sealing the wound and expediting coagulation, reducing the hemostatic time from 825 to 297 s. Furthermore, HK sponges have excellent biosafety, positioning them as a promising absorbable sponge with the potential for the treatment of noncompressible hemostasis.",

      "abstract": "Food-drug interactions should be suspected when a patient is taking their medications as directed and doses are optimized yet therapy is still not optimal (increased adverse effects, decreased efficacy, new adverse effects, etc). In all individuals with suspected food-drug interactions, diet history, baseline laboratory values, drug concentrations, and prescription history are recommended to assess the patient for a possible food-drug interaction. The 3 types of food-drug interactions are pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic. Pharmaceutical interactions occur with delivery devices or enteral feeding products. Pharmacokinetic interactions include the processes of a drug's release, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and/or elimination, ultimately affecting the effectiveness and safety of therapy. Pharmacodynamic interactions occur when food alters a drug's clinical effect on the body. The most common food-drug interactions exist with fruits (especially grapefruit), dairy, vitamin K, tyramine-containing foods, and alcohol. Patient counseling and collaboration between health-care teams can help patients avoid food-drug interactions. As a result, medication therapy can be optimized and adverse effects can be avoided.",

      "title": "Aspartame-True or False? Narrative Review of Safety Analysis of General Use in Products.",
      "abstract": "Aspartame is a sweetener introduced to replace the commonly used sucrose. It was discovered by James M. Schlatter in 1965. Being 180-200 times sweeter than sucrose, its intake was expected to reduce obesity rates in developing countries and help those struggling with diabetes. It is mainly used as a sweetener for soft drinks, confectionery, and medicines. Despite its widespread use, its safety remains controversial. This narrative review investigates the existing literature on the use of aspartame and its possible effects on the human body to refine current knowledge. Taking to account that aspartame is a widely used artificial sweetener, it seems appropriate to continue research on safety. Studies mentioned in this article have produced very interesting results overall, the current review highlights the social problem of providing visible and detailed information about the presence of aspartame in products. The studies involving the impact of aspartame on obesity, diabetes mellitus, children and fetus, autism, neurodegeneration, phenylketonuria, allergies and skin problems, its cancer properties and its genotoxicity were analyzed. Further research should be conducted to ensure clear information about the impact of aspartame on health.",

      "abstract": "The growing interest in foods that can be beneficial to human health is bringing into focus some products that have been used locally for centuries but have recently gained worldwide attention. One of these foods is pumpkin seed oil, which has been used in culinary and traditional medicine, but recent data also show its use in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. In addition, some sources refer to it as a potential functional food, mainly because it is obtained from pumpkin seeds, which contain many functional components. However, the production process of the oil may affect the content of these components and consequently the biological activity of the oil. In this review, we have focused on summarizing scientific data that explore the potential of pumpkin seed oil as a functional food ingredient. We provide a comprehensive overview of pumpkin seed oil chemical composition, phytochemical content, biological activity, and safety, as well as the overview of production processes and contemporary use. The main phytochemicals in pumpkin seed oil with health-related properties are polyphenols, phytoestrogens, and fatty acids, but carotenoids, squalene, tocopherols, and minerals may also contribute to health benefits. Most studies have been conducted in vitro and support the claim that pumpkin seed oil has antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Clinical studies have shown that pumpkin seed oil may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular problems of menopausal women and ailments associated with imbalance of sex hormones.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric insomnia can affect physical and mental health and cause cognitive deficits, social deficits and decrease quality of life. There are no Food and Drug Administration approved medications approved for pediatric insomnia. Pharmacologic interventions derive mostly from adult data or pediatric case reports. This review focuses on Food and Drug Administration approved prescription drugs (in adults), over-the-counter drugs, and off-label pediatric insomnia drugs. This review helps the clinician learn general principles, practice guidelines, and pharmacologic considerations for medication selection in the pediatric population. Pharmacologic management should be considered in combination with behavior therapy, which is proven to have long-lasting outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Solid-phase microextraction (SPME) is a sample preparation technique which utilizes small amounts of an extraction phase for the extraction of target analytes from investigated sample matrices. Its simplicity of use, relatively short sample processing time, and fiber reusability have made SPME an attractive choice for many analytical applications. SPME has been widely applied to the sampling and analysis of environmental, food, aromatic, metallic, forensic, and pharmaceutical samples. Solid phase microextraction is used in horticultural crops, for example, to determine water and soil contaminants (pesticides, alcohols, phenols, amines, herbicides, etc.). SPME is also used in the food industry to separate biologically active substances in food products for various purposes, for example, disease prevention, determining the smell of food products, and analyzing tastes. SPME has been applied to forensic analysis to determine the alcohol concentration in blood and that of sugar in urine. This method has also been widely used in pharmaceutical analysis. It is a solvent-free sample preparation technique that integrates sampling, isolation, and concentration. This review focuses on recent work on the use of SPME techniques in the analysis of food and horticultural crops.",

      "abstract": "Herbal medicine has a long history of medical efficacy with low toxicity, side effects and good biocompatibility. However, the bioavailability of the extract of raw herbs and bioactive compounds is poor because of their low water solubility. In order to overcome the solubility issues, electrospinning technology can offer a delivery alternative to resolve them. The electrospun fibers have the advantages of high specific surface area, high porosity, excellent mechanical strength and flexible structures. At the same time, various natural and synthetic polymer-bound fibers can mimic extracellular matrix applications in different medical fields. In this paper, the development of electrospinning technology and polymers used for incorporating herbal medicine into electrospun nanofibers are reviewed. Finally, the recent progress of the applications of these herbal medicine nanofibers in biomedical (drug delivery, wound dressing, tissue engineering) and food fields along with their future prospects is discussed.",

Our findings show that crystallization and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were the most commonly used workup steps and in-process controls, respectively, in drug substance manufacturing. On average, each NDA implemented 12.6 in-process controls and 11.3 workups. Operation time for reactions and workup procedures varied from a few minutes to multiple days, though 61% of these were between 1 and 10 h.",

Moreover, selenium supplementation can improve the immunity and fertility of the body, as well as its ability to resist oxidation, tumors, heavy metals, and pathogenic microorganisms. However, owing to the duality of selenium, excessive selenium supplementation can cause certain toxic effects on the growth and development of the body and may even result in death in severe cases. At present, increasing attention is being paid to the development and utilization of selenium as a micronutrient, but its potential toxicity tends to be neglected. This study systematically reviews recent research on the toxicological effects of selenium, aiming to provide theoretical references for selenium toxicology-related research and theoretical support for the development of selenium-containing drugs, selenium-enriched dietary supplements, and selenium-enriched foods.",

      "abstract": "Food is the essential need of human life and has nutrients that support growth and health. Gastrointestinal tract microbiota involves valuable microorganisms that develop therapeutic effects and are characterized as probiotics. The investigations on appropriate probiotic strains have led to the characterization of specific metabolic byproducts of probiotics named postbiotics. The probiotics must maintain their survival against inappropriate lethal conditions of the processing, storage, distribution, preparation, and digestion system so that they can exhibit their most health effects. Conversely, probiotic metabolites (postbiotics) have successfully overcome these unfavorable conditions and may be an appropriate alternative to probiotics. Due to their specific chemical structure, safe profile, long shelf-life, and the fact that they contain various signaling molecules, postbiotics may have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive properties, inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation and antioxidative activities. Consequently, present scientific literature approves that postbiotics can mimic the fundamental and clinical role of probiotics, and due to their unique characteristics, they can be applied in an oral delivery system (pharmaceutical/functional foods), as a preharvest food safety hurdle, to promote the shelf-life of food products and develop novel functional foods or/and for developing health benefits, and therapeutic aims. This review addresses the latest postbiotic applications with regard to pharmaceutical formulations and commercial food-based products. Potential postbiotic applications in the promotion of host health status, prevention of disease, and complementary treatment are also reviewed.",

      "abstract": "Life expectancy has increased substantially over the last 150 years. Yet this means that now most people also spend a greater length of time suffering from various age-associated diseases. As such, delaying age-related functional decline and extending healthspan, the period of active older years free from disease and disability, is an overarching objective of current aging research. Geroprotectors, compounds that target pathways that causally influence aging, are increasingly recognized as a means to extend healthspan in the aging population. Meanwhile, FOXO3 has emerged as a geroprotective gene intricately involved in aging and healthspan. FOXO3 genetic variants are linked to human longevity, reduced disease risks, and even self-reported health. Therefore, identification of FOXO3-activating compounds represents one of the most direct candidate approaches to extending healthspan in aging humans. In this work, we review compounds that activate FOXO3, or influence healthspan or lifespan in a FOXO3-dependent manner. These compounds can be classified as pharmaceuticals, including PI3K/AKT inhibitors and AMPK activators, antidepressants and antipsychotics, muscle relaxants, and HDAC inhibitors, or as nutraceuticals, including primary metabolites involved in cell growth and sustenance, and secondary metabolites including extracts, polyphenols, terpenoids, and other purified natural compounds. The compounds documented here provide a basis and resource for further research and development, with the ultimate goal of promoting healthy longevity in humans.",

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm is an ideal bioreactor for the production and storage of high-value active substances, including pharmaceutical proteins, oral vaccines, vitamins, and nutraceuticals such as flavonoids and carotenoids. Here, we explore the use of molecular farming from producing medicines to developing functional food crops (biofortification). We review recent progress in producing pharmaceutical proteins and bioactive substances in rice endosperm and compare this platform with other plant expression systems. We describe how rice endosperm could be modified to design metabolic pathways and express and store stable products and discuss the factors restricting the commercialization of transgenic rice products and future prospects.",

      "title": "Deep Eutectic Solvents: Fundamental Aspect, Characterizations and Applications.",
      "abstract": "Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) containing bioactive have been explored as potential choices for therapeutic efficiency enhancement. DESs are regarded as superior compared to established solvents owing to accessibility, storage conditions, synthesis, and low cost. As such, intensive research has taken place in different disciplines, especially nutraceuticals, foods and pharmaceuticals. The applications of DESs, especially in nutraceuticals and pharmaceutical delivery, have shown great promise. Despite these different successes, the safety issues of these DESs need to be properly identified. A safe mixture of DESs must be developed to take its broad range of advantages to the nutraceutical industry, and, therefore, its nutraceutical applications can only be introduced if DESs are known to have profiles of negligible or minimal toxicity. This review emphasizes the fundamental aspects needed to have a better understanding of DESs. It covers the current prospects of DES, including types, properties, formulation components and characterization methods. The several characterization methods, viz., pH, density, refractive index, viscosity, surface tension, solubility, polarized optical microscopy, x-ray diffraction studies, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are also mentioned. Further, the promising applications of DESs in different nutraceutical and pharmaceutical domains are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Amorphous solid products have recently gained a lot of attention as key solutions to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble nutraceuticals. A pure amorphous drug is a high-energy form; physically/chemically unstable and so easily gets recrystallized into the less soluble crystalline form limiting solubility and bioavailability issues. Amorphous solid dispersion and co-amorphous are new formulation approach that stabilized unstable amorphous form through different mechanisms such as preventing mobility, high glass transition temperature and molecular interaction. Nutraceuticals have been received the utmost importance due to their health benefits. However, most of these compounds have been associated with poor oral bioavailability due to poor solubility, high lipophilicity, high melting point, poor permeability, degradability and rapid metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) which limits its health benefits. This review provides us a systematic application of amorphous systems to the delivery of poorly soluble nutraceuticals, with the aim of overcoming their pharmacokinetic limitations and improved pharmacological potential. In particular, it describes the challenges associated with delivery of oral nutraceuticals, various methods involved in the preparation and characterization of amorphous systems and permeability enhancement of nutraceuticals are in detail.",

Recent research advances have therefore, focused on finding suitable economic substrates for the sustainable cultivation of microalgae. Among such substrates, food derived waste specifically from the starch, meat, dairy, brewery, oil and fruit and vegetable processing industries has gained popularity but poses numerous challenges. Pretreatment, dilution of waste water supernatants, mixing of different food waste streams, utilizing two-stage cultivation and other biorefinery approaches have been intensively explored for multifold improvement in microalgal biomass recovery from food waste. This review discusses the advances and challenges associated with cultivation of microalgae on food waste. The review suggests that there is a need to standardize different waste substrates in terms of general composition, genetically engineered microalgal strains, tackling process scalability issues, controlling wastewater toxicity and establishing a waste transportation chain.",

      "abstract": "Inhaled medicines continue to be an essential part of treatment for respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cystic fibrosis. In addition, inhalation technology, which is an active area of research and innovation to deliver medications via the lung to the bloodstream, offers potential advantages such as rapid onset of action, enhanced bioavailability, and reduced side effects for local treatments. Certain inhaled macromolecules and particles can also end up in different organs via lymphatic transport from the respiratory epithelium. While the majority of research on inhaled medicines is focused on the delivery technology, particle engineering, combination therapies, innovations in inhaler devices, and digital health technologies, researchers are also exploring new pharmaceutical technologies and strategies to prolong the duration of action of inhaled drugs. This is because, in contrast to most inhaled medicines that exert a rapid onset and short duration of action, long-acting inhaled medicines (LAIM) improve not only the patient compliance by reducing the dosing frequency, but also the effectiveness and convenience of inhaled therapies to better manage patients' conditions. This paper reviews the advances in LAIM, the pharmaceutical technologies and strategies for developing LAIM, and emerging new inhaled modalities that possess a long-acting nature and potential in the treatment and prevention of various diseases. The challenges in the development of the future LAIM are also discussed where active research and innovations are taking place.",

      "abstract": "Encapsulation technologies can be used to preserve therapeutic and bioactive compounds from harsh conditions (e.g., light, moisture, and oxygen) and biological destruction (enzymes, metabolism, and phagocytosis). Encapsulation involves the incorporation of the active moieties into a shell structure (e.g., protein, polysaccharide or lipid-based material). These techniques can improve the physicochemical properties of the encapsulated compounds, provide sustained release to specific organs, \"cover up\" undesirable properties, and improve their solubility, dispersion, and bioavailability. Different techniques have been applied to encapsulate drug compounds, including emulsification, inclusion complexation, nanoparticulate systems (solid lipid nanoparticles and nanostructured lipid carriers), liposome entrapment, nanoprecipitation, freeze drying, spray drying, etc. However, high temperatures or toxic solvents are used in some of these techniques such as spray drying, and liposome entrapment can degrade the bioactive compounds or reduce their functionality. Electrohydrodynamic spraying (electrospraying) is a versatile tool for liquid atomization by means of electrical forces. This technique is simple and easily controllable without any harsh conditions and could be a promising alternative method to encapsulate sensitive compounds. By optimizing the process variables e.g., properties of polymer solutions (type, viscosity, conductivity), solvent type, process parameters (applied voltage between the needle tip and the collector surface, applied flow rate, distance between the needle tip and the collector, ambient temperature, and relative humidity) this technique can be effectively used for micro- and nanoencapsulation of drug compounds. This article reviews the effects of electrospraying parameters in production of monodisperse particles with well-controlled shapes and high encapsulation efficiency. It also, summarizes the latest reports of encapsulation of therapeutic compounds, and critically discusses the limitations and future perspectives of this technique.",

The oral bioavailability is always compromised from the poor physicochemical and/or biopharmaceutical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredients. Food protein nanoparticles show promise for oral drug delivery, with improved biosafety and cost-effectiveness compared to polymeric nanoparticles. More importantly, diverse food proteins provide \"choice and variety\" to meet the challenges faced by different drugs in oral delivery resulting from low solubility, poor permeability, and gastrointestinal stability. The abundance of hydroxyl, amino, and carboxyl groups in food proteins allows easy surface modification of the nanoparticles to impart unique functions. Albeit being in its infancy, food protein nanoparticles exhibit high capability to enhance oral bioavailability of a wide range of drugs from small molecules to biomacromolecules. Considering the rapid growth of the field, the achievements and mechanisms of food protein nanoparticles in enhancing oral bioavailability are reviewed. Factors affecting the performance of food protein nanoparticles are discussed with the purpose to inspire the development of food protein nanoparticle-based oral drug delivery systems.",

      "title": "Polysaccharides polymers for glaucoma treatment-a review.",
      "abstract": "One of the major challenges in preventing glaucoma progression is patient compliance with medication regimens. Since conventional ophthalmic dosage forms have numerous limitations, researchers have been intensively working on developing polymers-based delivery systems for glaucoma drugs. Specifically, research and development efforts have increased using polysaccharide polymers such as sodium alginate, cellulose, β-cyclodextrin, hyaluronic acid, chitosan, pectin, gellan gum, galactomannans for sustained release to the eye to overcome treatment challenges, showing promise in improving drug release and delivery, patient experience, and treatment compliance. In the recent past, multiple research groups have successfully designed sustained drug delivery systems, promoting the efficacy as well as the feasibility of glaucoma drugs with single/combinations of polysaccharides to eliminate the drawbacks associated with the glaucoma treatment. Naturally available polysaccharides, when used as drug vehicles can increase the retention time of eye drops on the ocular surface, leading to improved drug absorption and bioavailability. Additionally, some polysaccharides can form gels or matrices that can release drugs slowly over time, providing sustained drug delivery and reducing the need for frequent dosing. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the pre-clinical and clinical studies of polysaccharide polymers applied for glaucoma treatment along with their therapeutic outcomes.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy and Nutritional Supplements for Neovascular Eye Diseases.",
      "abstract": "In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the recent findings about the treatment of neovascular retinal diseases. The use of conventional drugs and nutraceuticals endowed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may support conventional therapies will be considered, with the final aim of achieving risk reduction (prevention) and outcome improvement (cooperation between treatments) of such sight-threatening proliferative retinopathies. For this purpose, we consider a medicinal product one that contains well-defined compound(s) with proven pharmacological and therapeutic effects, usually given for the treatment of full-blown diseases. Rarely are prescription drugs given for preventive purposes. A dietary supplement refers to a compound (often an extract or a mixture) used in the prevention or co-adjuvant treatment of a given pathology. However, it must be kept in mind that drug-supplement interactions may exist and might affect the efficacy of certain drug treatments. Moreover, the distinction between medicinal products and dietary supplements is not always straightforward. For instance, melatonin is formulated as a medicinal product for the treatment of sleep and behavioral problems; at low doses (usually below 1 mg), it is considered a nutraceutical, while at higher doses, it is sold as a psychotropic drug. Despite their lower status with respect to drugs, increasing evidence supports the notion of the beneficial effects of dietary supplements on proliferative retinopathies, a major cause of vision loss in the elderly. Therefore, we believe that, on a patient-by-patient basis, the administration of nutraceuticals, either alone or in association, could benefit many patients, delaying the progression of their disease and likely improving the efficacy of pharmaceutical drugs.",

      "abstract": "Ascorbic acid, known as vitamin C, is an important antioxidant and food ingredient, and highly sensitive to environmental conditions, which makes its incorporation into food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products more difficult. The evaluation of its nano/microencapsulation enables the improvement of its stability and controlled release. There are various investigations regarding ascorbic acid encapsulation; however, a deep study related to the scale-up of encapsulation process, its application into food products and digestibility study are still needed. This review highlights the main physicochemical and health properties of vitamin C, recent advances of its encapsulation into micro/nanocarriers, and application in food products. Also, the controlled release and bioavailability of encapsulated forms within different carriers is underlined. The results of published studies clearly show that vitamin C can be successfully protected within micro/nanoencapsulation systems and it can be applied as an efficient ingredient in the formulation of various food products such as bakery goods.",

However, current quality control (QC) requirements for traditional large-scale pharmaceutical manufacturing are irreconcilable with the production offered by 3DP. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have recently published documents supporting the implementation of 3DP for point-of-care (PoC) manufacturing along with regulatory hurdles. The importance of process analytical technology (PAT) and non-destructive analytical tools in translating pharmaceutical 3DP has experienced a surge in recognition. This review seeks to highlight the most recent research on non-destructive pharmaceutical 3DP analysis, while also proposing plausible QC systems that complement the pharmaceutical 3DP workflow. In closing, outstanding challenges in integrating these analytical tools into pharmaceutical 3DP workflows are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health concern with millions of deaths every year. The overlap with HIV infections, long treatment duration, and the emergence of drug resistance are significant obstacles to the control of the disease. Indeed, the standard first-line regimen TB treatment takes at least six months and even longer for the second-line therapy, resulting in relapses, drug resistance and re-infections. Many recent reports have also shown prolonged and significant damage of the gut microbial community (dysbiosis) from anti-TB drugs that can detrimentally persist several months after the cessation of treatment and could lead to the impairment of the immune response, and thus re-infections and drug resistance. A proposed strategy for shortening the treatment duration is thus to apply corrective measures to the dysbiosis for a faster bacterial clearance and a better treatment outcome. In this review, we will study the role of the gut microbiota in both TB infection and treatment, and its potential link with treatment duration. We will also discuss, the new concept of \"Host Microbiota Directed-Therapies (HMDT)\" as a potential adjunctive strategy to improve the treatment effectiveness, reduce its duration and or prevent relapses. These strategies include the use of probiotics, prebiotics, gut microbiota transfer, and other strategies. Application of this innovative solution could lead to HMDT as an adjunctive tool to shorten TB treatment, which will have enormous public health impacts for the End TB Strategy worldwide.",

The associated undesirable side effects of chemotherapy agents jeopardize the clinical intent and the efficiency of the therapy. Multiple studies have been published describing new developments and novel strategies utilizing the latest therapeutic and drug delivery technologies to address the efficacy and safety of chemotherapeutics in ovarian cancers. We have identified five novel technologies that are available and, if used, have the potential to mitigate the above-mentioned challenges. Nanocarriers in different forms (Nano-gel, Aptamer, peptide medicated formulations, Antibody-drug conjugation, surface charge, and nanovesicle technologies) are developed and available to be employed to target the cancerous tissue. These strategies are promising to improve clinical efficacy and reduce side effects. We have systematically searched and analyzed published data, as well as the authors intent for the described technology on each publication. We narrowed to 81 key articles and extracted their data to be discussed in this review. In summary, the selected articles investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs combined with nanocarriers and found significant improvement in efficacy and safety by reducing the IC50 values and drug doses. These key papers described promising novel technologies in anti-cancer therapeutic approaches to enable sustained drug release and achieve prolonged drug performance near the tumor site or target tissue.",

To study the neural mechanisms of maladaptive behaviors (including binge eating and drug addiction), it is essential to develop and utilize appropriate animal models that specifically focus on dysregulated reward seeking. Both food and cocaine are typically consumed in a regulated manner by rodents, motivated by reward and homeostatic mechanisms. However, both food and cocaine seeking can become dysregulated, resulting in binge-like consumption and compulsive patterns of intake. The speakers in this symposium for the 2021 International Behavioral Neuroscience Meeting utilize behavioral models of dysregulated reward-seeking to investigate the neural mechanisms of binge-like consumption, enhanced cue-driven reward seeking, excessive motivation, and continued use despite negative consequences. In this review, we outline examples of maladaptive patterns of intake and explore recent animal models that drive behavior to become dysregulated, including stress exposure and intermittent access to rewards.

      "abstract": "The oral route has long been recognized as the most preferred route for drug delivery as it offers high patient compliance and requires minimal expertise. Unlike small molecule drugs, the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and low permeability across the intestinal epithelium make oral delivery extremely ineffective for macromolecules. Accordingly, delivery systems that are rationally constructed with suitable materials to overcome barriers to oral delivery are exceptionally promising. Among the most ideal materials are polysaccharides. Depending on the interaction between polysaccharides and proteins, the thermodynamic loading and release of proteins in the aqueous phase can be realized. Specific polysaccharides (dextran, chitosan, alginate, cellulose, etc.) endow systems with functional properties, including muco-adhesiveness, pH-responsiveness, and prevention of enzymatic degradation. Furthermore, multiple groups in polysaccharides can be modified, which gives them a variety of properties and enables them to suit specific needs. This review provides an overview of different types of polysaccharide-based nanocarriers based on different kinds of interaction forces and the influencing factors in the construction of polysaccharide-based nanocarriers. Strategies of polysaccharide-based nanocarriers to improve the bioavailability of orally administered proteins/peptides were described. Additionally, current restrictions and future trends of polysaccharide-based nanocarriers for oral delivery of proteins/peptides were also covered.",

It is a highly nutritious food, abundant in nutritional and bioactive compounds such as carbohydrates, protein, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and polyphenols. It is considered a functional food owing to its various health benefits such as antidiabetic, antihyperlipidemic, antifatigue, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, antimelanogenic, etc. E. ferox has immense potential in both food and non-food industries. Regardless of being recognized as a superfood packed with nutritional as well as medicinal properties, it is still neglected, and there has not been much attention given to its cultivation. Therefore, in this review, the potential of E. ferox as a superfood has been explored to enhance its utilization in the development of different foods and make it available outside its growing area. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Euryale ferox is abundant in several macronutrients and micronutrients; and considered as a superfood in terms of various health benefits. E. ferox has the ability to be used in the development of different health, functional, and nutraceutical foods, which will open a new door for the food industry to combat with numerous diseases.",

      "abstract": "Renal I/R injury is a severe medical condition contributing to acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to rapid kidney dysfunction and high mortality rates. It is generally observed during renal transplantation, shock, trauma, and urologic and cardiovascular surgery, for which there is no effective treatment. Cell death and damage are commonly linked to I/R. Cell death triggered by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, such as ferroptosis, has been demonstrated to have a significant detrimental effect in renal IRI models, making it a new type of cell death currently being researched. Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic type of cell death that occurs when free iron enters the cell and is a critical component of many biological processes. In ferroptosis-induced renal I/R injury, iron chelators such as Deferasirox, Deferiprone, and lipophilic antioxidants are currently suppressed lipid peroxidation Liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), Ferrostatin-1 along with antioxidants like vitamin and quercetin. Ferroptosis has been considered a potential target for pharmaceutical intervention to alleviate renal IRI-associated cell damage. Thus, this review emphasized the role of ferroptosis and its inhibition in renal IRI. Also, Pharmacological modulation of ferroptosis mechanism in renal I/R injury has been conferred.

Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets and have a reduced environmental impact, including producing lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Dietary guidelines are normally formulated to enhance the health of society, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and prevent nutritional deficiencies. We reviewed the scientific data on plant-based diets to summarize their preventative and therapeutic role in cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. Consuming plant-based diets is safe and effective for all stages of the life cycle, from pregnancy and lactation, to childhood, to old age. Plant-based diets, which are high in fiber and polyphenolics, are also associated with a diverse gut microbiota, producing metabolites that have anti-inflammatory functions that may help manage disease processes. Concerns about the adequate intake of a number of nutrients, including vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fats, are discussed. The use of fortified foods and/or supplements as well as appropriate food choices are outlined for each nutrient. Finally, guidelines are suggested for health professionals working with clients consuming plant-based diets.",

A systematic review of observational and intervention studies published between 2000 and January 2020 was conducted to assess nutrient intake and status in adult populations consuming plant-based diets (mainly vegetarian and vegan) with that of meat-eaters. Mean intake of nutrients were calculated and benchmarked to dietary reference values. For micronutrient status, mean concentrations of biomarkers were calculated and compared across diet groups. A total of 141 studies were included, mostly from Europe, South/East Asia, and North America. Protein intake was lower in people following plant-based diets compared to meat-eaters, but well within recommended intake levels. While fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), folate, vitamin C, E and magnesium intake was higher, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was lower in vegetarians and vegans as compared to meat-eaters. Intake and status of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium and bone turnover markers were generally lower in plant-based dietary patterns compared to meat-eaters. Vegans had the lowest vitamin B12, calcium and iodine intake, and also lower iodine status and lower bone mineral density. Meat-eaters were at risk of inadequate intakes of fiber, PUFA, α-linolenic acid (ALA), folate, vitamin D, E, calcium and magnesium. There were nutrient inadequacies across all dietary patterns, including vegan, vegetarian and meat-based diets. As plant-based diets are generally better for health and the environment, public health strategies should facilitate the transition to a balanced diet with more diverse nutrient-dense plant foods through consumer education, food fortification and possibly supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Individuals may opt to follow a plant-based diet for a variety of reasons, such as religious practices, health benefits or concerns for animal or environmental welfare. Such diets offer a broad spectrum of health benefits including aiding in the prevention and management of chronic diseases. In addition to health benefits, a plant-based diet may provide performance-enhancing effects for various types of exercise due to high carbohydrate levels and the high concentration of antioxidants and phytochemicals found in a plant-based diet. However, some plant-based foods also contain anti-nutrional factors, such as phytate and tannins, which decrease the bioavailability of key nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and protein. Thus, plant-based diets must be carefully planned to ensure adequate intake and absorption of energy and all essential nutrients. The current narrative review summarizes the current state of the research concerning the implications of a plant-based diet for health and exercise performance. It also outlines strategies to enhance the bioavailability of nutrients, sources of hard-to-get nutrients, and sport supplements that could interest plant-based athletes.",

      "title": "The Anabolic Response to Plant-Based Protein Ingestion.",
      "abstract": "There is a global trend of an increased interest in plant-based diets. This includes an increase in the consumption of plant-based proteins at the expense of animal-based proteins. Plant-derived proteins are now also frequently applied in sports nutrition. So far, we have learned that the ingestion of plant-derived proteins, such as soy and wheat protein, result in lower post-prandial muscle protein synthesis responses when compared with the ingestion of an equivalent amount of animal-based protein. The lesser anabolic properties of plant-based versus animal-derived proteins may be attributed to differences in their protein digestion and amino acid absorption kinetics, as well as to differences in amino acid composition between these protein sources. Most plant-based proteins have a low essential amino acid content and are often deficient in one or more specific amino acids, such as lysine and methionine. However, there are large differences in amino acid composition between various plant-derived proteins or plant-based protein sources. So far, only a few studies have directly compared the muscle protein synthetic response following the ingestion of a plant-derived protein versus a high(er) quality animal-derived protein. The proposed lower anabolic properties of plant- versus animal-derived proteins may be compensated for by (i) consuming a greater amount of the plant-derived protein or plant-based protein source to compensate for the lesser quality; (ii) using specific blends of plant-based proteins to create a more balanced amino acid profile; (iii) fortifying the plant-based protein (source) with the specific free amino acid(s) that is (are) deficient. Clinical studies are warranted to assess the anabolic properties of the various plant-derived proteins and their protein sources in vivo in humans and to identify the factors that may or may not compromise the capacity to stimulate post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates. Such work is needed to determine whether the transition towards a more plant-based diet is accompanied by a transition towards greater dietary protein intake requirements.",

      "abstract": "The human skin is a crucial organ that protects the organism from the outer environment. Skin integrity and health depend on both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors such as aging and genetic background contribute to weakened skin and disease susceptibility. Meanwhile, extrinsic factors including UV radiation, pollution, smoking, humidity, and poor diet also affect skin health and disease. On the other hand, healthy dietary patterns such as plant-based diets have gained popularity as a complementary therapy for skin health. A plant-based diet is defined as all diets based on plant foods, including an abundance of vegetables, fruits, beans, lentils, legumes, nuts, seeds, fungi, and whole grains, with limited or no animal products or processed foods. However, some authors also exclude or limit processed foods in the definition. Recent research has shown that these diets have beneficial effects on inflammatory skin diseases. This review explored the beneficial effects of plant-based diets on inflammatory skin diseases and plant-based functional foods on healthy skin. In conclusion, plant-based diets and plant-based functional foods may have beneficial effects on skin health through the gut microbiome.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets (PBDs) have become very popular in recent years and have been identified as a dietary strategy associated with protection against chronic disease. However, the classifications of PBDs vary depending on the type of diet. Some PBDs have been recognized as healthful for their high content of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber, or unhealthful if they are high in simple sugars and saturated fat. Depending on this classification, the type of PBD impacts its protective effects against disease dramatically. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), characterized by the presence of high plasma triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, impaired glucose metabolism, elevated blood pressure, and increased concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, also increases the risk for heart disease and diabetes. Thus, healthful plant-based diets could be considered favorable for individuals having MetS. The different types of plant-based diets (vegan, lacto-vegetarian, lacto-ovo-vegetarian, or pescatarian) are discussed with a focus on specific effects of dietary components in maintaining a healthy weight, protecting against dyslipidemias, insulin resistance, hypertension, and low-grade inflammation.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, plant-based diets have experienced increasing popularity. However, plant-based diets may not always ensure an adequate supply of micronutrients, in particular calcium. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of calcium intake in vegan and vegetarian diets as compared to omnivorous diets. We searched PubMed and Web of Science and identified 2,009 potentially relevant articles. Mean calcium intake values were pooled and standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed.We analyzed 74 studies, including 7,356 vegan, 51,940 vegetarian, and 107,581 omnivorous participants. Of these, dietary calcium intake was examined in 23 studies of vegans, 60 studies of vegetarians and 74 studies of omnivores. Vegans showed a substantially lower calcium intake than vegetarians (SMD = -0.57; 95%CI = -0.83 to -0.32; p = <0.0001) and omnivores (SMD = -0.70; 95%CI = -0.95 to -0.59; p < 0.0001), whereas no statistically significant difference in calcium intake was noted between vegetarians and omnivores (SMD = 0.07; 95%CI = -0.04 to 0.19; p = 0.1976). In conclusion, vegans show a lower calcium intake than vegetarians and omnivores. This finding emphasizes the need for vegans to monitor their calcium status.",

      "abstract": "The high decline in liquid milk consumption in Western countries has been compensated by the increased consumption of processed dairy products and the rapidly increasing number of new plant-based beverages constantly introduced in the market, advertised as milk substitutes and placed on shelves near milk products. To provide better understanding about the nutritional value of these drinks compared with cow's milk, 27 plant-based drinks of 8 different species and two milk samples were purchased from two big retailers in Switzerland, and their composition regarding protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamin, and mineral contents and residue load [glyphosate, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and arsenic] was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Energy and nutrient intakes were calculated and compared with the dietary reference values for Germany, Austria and Switzerland (D-A-CH). In addition, the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) was calculated to estimate the quality of the proteins. Milk contained more energy; fat; carbohydrate; vitamins C, B",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets have grown increasingly popular across the globe, mainly for their health and environmental benefits. Several studies have identified a link between plant-based diets and the decreased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and other health issues. We systematically reviewed human interventions to identify the relationship between various plant-based food items and the gut microbiome, alongside the biochemical and anthropometric measurements as secondary findings. The study selection process was completed using the COVIDENCE platform. Overall, 203 studies were identified, of which 101 were chosen for title and abstract screening by two independent authors. Following this process, 78 studies were excluded, and the full texts and the reference lists of the remaining 23 records were reviewed using the review eligibility criteria. A manual search yielded five additional articles. In the end, 12 studies were included in the systematic review. We found evidence for short- to moderate-term beneficial effects of plant-based diets versus conventional diets (duration ≤ 13 months) on gut microbiome composition and biochemical and anthropometric measurements in healthy participants as well as obese, cardiovascular, and rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, contradictory results were observed for Enterobacteriaceae, at the family level, and for Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus, at the genus level, of gut microbiome composition. The relationship between plant-based diets and the gut microbiome, alongside their underlying metabolic and inflammatory effects, remains largely unexplored. Hence more interventional studies are needed to address these questions.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets have emerged as athletic performance enhancers for various types of exercise. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effectiveness of plant-based diets on aerobic and strength/power performances, as well as on BMI of physically active individuals. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the guidelines outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. A systematic search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and SPORTDiscus, was performed. On the basis of the search and inclusion criteria, four and six studies evaluating the effects of plant-based diets on aerobic and strength/power performances in humans were, respectively, included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Plant-based diets had a moderate but positive effect on aerobic performance (0·55; 95 % CI 0·29, 0·81) and no effect on strength/power performance (-0·30; 95 % CI -0·67, 0·07). The altogether analyses of both aerobic and strength/power exercises revealed that athletic performance was unchanged (0·01; 95 % CI -0·21, 0·22) in athletes who adopted plant-based diets. However, a small negative effect on BMI (-0·27; 95 % CI -0·40, -0·15) was induced by these diets. The results indicate that plant-based diets have the potential to exclusively assist aerobic performance. On the other hand, these diets do not jeopardise strength/power performance. Overall, the predicted effects of plant-based diets on physical performance are impactless, even though the BMI of their adherents is reduced.",

      "title": "Plant-Based Seafood Analogs.",
      "abstract": "There is a growing global need to shift from animal- towards plant-based diets. The main motivations are environmental/sustainability-, human health- and animal welfare concerns. The aim is to replace traditional animal-based food with various alternatives, predominantly plant-based analogs. The elevated consumption of fish and seafood, leads to negative impacts on the ecosystem, due to dwindling biodiversity, environmental damage and fish diseases related to large-scale marine farming, and increased intake of toxic substances, particularly heavy metals, which accumulate in fish due to water pollution. While these facts lead to increased awareness and rising dietary shifts towards vegetarian and vegan lifestyles, still the majority of seafood consumers seek traditional products. This encourages the development of plant-based analogs for fish and seafood, mimicking the texture and sensorial properties of fish-meat, seafood, or processed fish products. Mimicking the internal structure and texture of fish or seafood requires simulating their nanometric fibrous-gel structure. Common techniques of structuring plant-based proteins into such textures include hydrospinning, electrospinning, extrusion, and 3D printing. The conditions required in each technique, the physicochemical and functional properties of the proteins, along with the use of other non-protein functional ingredients are reviewed. Trends and possible future developments are discussed.",

      "title": "The Effect of Plant-Based Protein Ingestion on Athletic Ability in Healthy People-A Bayesian Meta-Analysis with Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
      "abstract": "Plant-based protein supplements are increasingly popular, yet their efficacy in enhancing athletic performance compared to animal protein, insect protein, or other protein types remains under investigation. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of plant-based protein on athletic abilities such as muscle strength, endurance performance, and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rate and compare it to no- or low-protein ingestion and non-plant protein sources. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the beneficial and harmful effects of plant-based protein ingestion on athletic ability in healthy individuals were considered. A systematic search of six databases yielded 2152 studies, which were screened using the Covidence systematic review tool. Thirty-one studies were included for meta-analysis after independent selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment by two reviewers. The meta-analysis employed a Bayesian approach using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method through a random-effects model. The results demonstrated that plant-based protein supplements provided greater benefits for athletic performance in healthy individuals compared to the no- or low-protein ingestion group [μ(SMD): 0.281, 95% CI: 0.159 to 0.412; heterogeneity τ: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.017 to 0.362]. However, when compared to other types of protein, plant-based protein ingestion was less effective in enhancing athletic ability [μ(SMD): -0.119, 95% CI: -0.209 to -0.028; heterogeneity τ: 0.076, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.192]. A subgroup analysis indicated significant improvements in muscle strength and endurance performance in both young and older individuals consuming plant-based protein compared to those with no- or low-protein ingestion. Nonetheless, other protein types showed greater benefits in muscle strength compared to plant-based protein [μ(SMD): -0.133, 95% CI: -0.235 to -0.034; heterogeneity τ: 0.086, 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.214]. In conclusion, while plant-based protein ingestion demonstrates superior efficacy compared to low- or no-protein ingestion, it is not as effective as other protein types such as whey, beef, or milk protein in enhancing athletic performance in healthy individuals.

      "abstract": "Despite increasing awareness of plant-based diets for health and athletic performance, athletes are cautioned that careful dietary monitoring is necessary. Whether commonly consumed plant-based diets are nutritionally adequate for maximal muscular hypertrophy remains unknown. This modeling study assessed the nutrient composition of completely plant-based diets scaled to the caloric demands of maximal muscle mass and strength development in adult male bodybuilders. To model calorie requirements, anthropometric data from bodybuilders were input into the Tinsley resting metabolic rate prediction equation, and an appropriate physical activity factor and calorie surplus were applied. Dietary data from a large cohort following completely plant-based diets were then scaled to meet these needs. Modeled intakes for nutrients of interest were calculated as 1.8 g/kg/day of protein and 2.75 g/meal of leucine, which surpass mean requirements for maximal increases in muscle mass and strength and muscle protein synthesis, respectively. Daily levels for all micronutrients, except vitamin D, also exceeded requirements. Saturated fat levels were aligned with dietary guidelines, although sodium levels exceeded recommended limits. Consumption of larger portions of commonplace plant-based diets, scaled to meet the energy demands of maximal accrual of muscle mass and strength, satisfied protein and leucine requirements without the need for additional planning.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based diets have grown in popularity owing to multiple health and environmental benefits. Some evidence suggests that plant-based diets are associated with benefits for urological health. In genitourinary oncology, most research has focused on prostate cancer. Clinical trial results suggest a favourable influence of healthy lifestyle modifications including plant-based diets before and after prostate cancer treatment. Epidemiological evidence shows that a diet higher in plant-based and lower in animal-based food is associated with a lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer and better quality-of-life scores than a diet with less plant-based and more animal-based food. Studies on bladder and kidney cancer are scarce, but limited data suggest that vegetarian or plant-forward dietary patterns (increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and minimizing meat) are associated with a lower risk of development of these cancers than dietary patterns with fewer fruits and vegetables and more meat. With respect to benign urological conditions, epidemiological studies suggest that plant-based dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia and urinary tract infections than non-plant-based dietary patterns. Compared with diets high in animal-based foods and low in plant-based foods, a substantial body of epidemiological evidence also suggests that increased consumption of healthy plant-based food is associated with a lower risk of erectile dysfunction. Plant-based dietary patterns that are high in fruits and vegetables with normal calcium intake, while limiting animal protein and salt, are associated with a lower risk of kidney stone development than dietary patterns that do not follow these parameters. Overall, increasing consumption of plant-based foods and reducing intake of animal-based foods has favourable associations with multiple urological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Present food systems threaten population and environmental health. Evidence suggests reduced meat and increased plant-based food consumption would align with climate change and health promotion priorities. Accelerating this transition requires greater understanding of determinants of plant-based food choice. A thriving plant-based food industry has emerged to meet consumer demand and support dietary shift towards plant-based eating. 'Traditional' plant-based diets are low-energy density, nutrient dense, low in saturated fat and purportedly associated with health benefits. However, fast-paced contemporary lifestyles continue to fuel growing demand for meat-mimicking plant-based convenience foods which are typically ultra-processed. Processing can improve product safety and palatability and enable fortification and enrichment. However, deleterious health consequences have been associated with ultra-processing, though there is a paucity of equivocal evidence regarding the health value of novel plant-based meat alternatives (PBMAs) and their capacity to replicate the nutritional profile of meat-equivalents. Thus, despite the health halo often associated with plant-based eating, there is a strong rationale to improve consumer literacy of PBMAs. Understanding the impact of extensive processing on health effects may help to justify the use of innovative methods designed to maintain health benefits associated with particular foods and ingredients. Furthering knowledge regarding the nutritional value of novel PBMAs will increase consumer awareness and thus support informed choice. Finally, knowledge of factors influencing engagement of target consumer subgroups with such products may facilitate production of desirable, healthier PBMAs. Such evidence-based food manufacturing practice has the potential to positively influence future individual and planetary health.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based milk alternatives can be distinguished in two main categories, differing in production processes and regulation: plant-based formulas and plant-based drinks. They are now a widely accepted class of products on the international market. The various plant-based milk alternatives differ in nutritional characteristics due to their origin and manufacturing; more importantly, whereas formulas from plant and cow origin can be used interchangeably, plant-based drinks are nutritionally different from cow's milk and can be consumed by children subsequently to the use of formula. Several scientific organizations have expressed differing opinions on the use of these products in the diets of children. In the face of unanimous conclusions regarding the use of these products during the first year of life, in subsequent ages there were conflicting opinions regarding the timing, quantities, and type of product to be used. From the viewpoint of the child's overall diet and health, it could be suggested that these foods be considered not as simple substitutes for cow's milk, but as part of a varied diet, within individual advice of use. We suggest accepting the presence of these products in a baby's diet (omnivores included), planning their use correctly in the context of a balanced diet, according to the specific product and the needs of the individual.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based drinks have garnered significant attention as viable substitutes for traditional dairy milk, providing options for individuals who are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy proteins, and those who adhere to vegan or vegetarian diets. In recent years, demand for plant-based drinks has expanded rapidly. Each variety has unique characteristics in terms of flavor, texture, and nutritional composition, offering consumers a diverse range of choices tailored to meet individual preferences and dietary needs. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the various types of plant-based drinks and explore potential considerations including their nutritional compositions, health benefits, and processing technologies, as well as the challenges facing the plant-based drink processing industry. We delve into scientific evidence supporting the consumption of plant-based drinks, discuss their potential roles in meeting dietary requirements, and address current limitations and concerns regarding their use. We hope to illuminate the growing significance of plant-based drinks as sustainable and nutritious alternatives to dairy milk, and assist individuals in making informed choices regarding their dietary habits, expanding potential applications for plant-based drinks, and providing necessary theoretical and technical support for the development of a plant-based drink processing industry.",

The roles of plant-based proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids in the formulation of emulsion gels and relevant processing techniques such as high-pressure homogenization (HPH), ultrasound (UH), and microfluidization (MF), were discussed in correlation with the effects of varying HPH, UH, and MF processing parameters on emulsion gel properties. The characterization methods for plant-based emulsion gels to quantify their rheological, thermal, and textural properties, as well as gel microstructure, were presented with a focus on how they can be applied for food purposes. Finally, the potential applications of plant-based emulsion gels, such as dairy and meat alternatives, condiments, baked goods, and functional foods, were discussed with a focus on sensory properties and consumer acceptance. This study found that the implementation of plant-based emulsion gel in food is promising to date despite persisting challenges.

      "abstract": "Our global population is growing at a pace to exceed 10 billion people by the year 2050. This growth will place pressure on the agricultural production of food to feed the hungry masses. One category that will be strained is protein. Per capita protein consumption is rising in virtually every country for both nutritional reasons and consumption enjoyment. The United Nations estimates protein demand will double by 2050, and this will result in a critical overall protein shortage if drastic changes are not made in the years preceding these changes. Therefore, the world is in the midst of identifying technological breakthroughs to make protein more readily available and sustainable for future generations. One protein sourcing category that has grown in the past decade is plant-based proteins, which seem to fit criteria established by discerning consumers, including healthy, sustainable, ethical, and relatively inexpensive. Although demand for plant-based protein continues to increase, these proteins are challenging to utilize in novel food formulations.",

      "abstract": "Innovations in food biotechnology reflect the increasing demand for healthy food and the change in conventional dietary patterns to plant-based diets, encouraging the development of functional products and opening new perspectives for industry interests. In addition, the development of vegetable-based products is supported by several studies that state that plant-based diets help reduce the risk of diseases, reduce stress, and even help maintain healthy body weight, making this diet a promising development for the future. The industry mainly uses fermentation techniques to obtain plant-based foodstuffs. However, fermentation is just one method that can develop probiotic products. Other methods include high moisture extrusion cooking and applying shear cells, for instance, for developing vegetable meats. This article summarizes trends and shifts in eating preferences, the response of the respective industry, and the future potential of plant-based products.",

      "abstract": "Plant-based foods are becoming an increasingly frequent topic of discussion, both scientific and social, due to the dissemination of information and exchange of experiences in the media. Plant-based diets are considered beneficial for human health due to the supply of many valuable nutrients, including health-promoting compounds. Replacing meat-based foods with plant-based products will provide many valuable compounds, including antioxidants, phenolic compounds, fibers, vitamins, minerals, and some ω3 fatty acids. Due to their high nutritional and functional composition, plant-based foods are beneficial in acute and chronic diseases. This article attempts to review the literature to present the most important data on nutrients of plant-based foods that can then help in the prevention of many diseases, such as different infections, such as coronavirus disease, pneumonia, common cold and flu, asthma, and bacterial diseases, such as bronchitis. A properly structured plant-based diet not only provides the necessary nutrients but also can help in the prevention of many diseases.",

      "title": "Glycemic Responses of Milk and Plant-Based Drinks: Food Matrix Effects.",
      "abstract": "The consumption of food items containing digestible carbohydrates in food products leads to postprandial increases in blood glucose levels and glycemic responses. The extent to which these occur depends on many factors, including concentration and type of carbohydrate, but also other physicochemical properties of the food matrix, which determine the rate of uptake of monosaccharides into the bloodstream, including product structure and factors affecting gastric emptying. For milk, control of postprandial glycemic responses appears to be multifaceted, including a controlled rate of gastric emptying, a rate of glucose and galactose uptake into the bloodstream controlled by enzymatic hydrolysis, as well as stimulated insulin secretion to enhance uptake of blood glucose from the bloodstream. Altogether, this allows milk to deliver comparatively high levels of carbohydrate with limited glycemic responses. For plant-based drinks positioned as milk alternatives, however, compositional differences (including carbohydrate type and concentration) as well as matrix factors limiting control over gastric emptying and insulin secretion can, in some cases, lead to much stronger glycemic responses, which are undesirable in relation to non-communicable diseases, such as type-2 diabetes. This review discusses glycemic responses to milk and plant-based drinks from this perspective, focusing on mechanistic insights and food matrix effects.",

      "title": "Designing healthier plant-based foods: Fortification, digestion, and bioavailability.",
      "abstract": "Many consumers are incorporating more plant-based foods into their diets as a result of concerns about the environmental, ethical, and health impacts of animal sourced foods like meat, seafood, egg, and dairy products. Foods derived from animals negatively impact the environment by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. The livestock industry confines and slaughters billions of livestock animals each year. There are concerns about the negative impacts of some animal sourced foods, such as red meat and processed meat, on human health. The livestock industry is a major user of antibiotics, which is leading to a rise in the resistance of several pathogenic microorganisms to antibiotics. It is often assumed that a plant-based diet is healthier than one containing more animal sourced foods, but this is not necessarily the case. Eating more fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grain cereals has been linked to improved health outcomes but it is unclear whether next-generation plant-based foods, such as meat, seafood, egg, and dairy analogs are healthier than the products they are designed to replace. Many of these new products are highly processed foods that contain high levels of saturated fat, sugar, starch, and salt, and low levels of micronutrients, nutraceuticals, and dietary fibers. Moreover, they are often rapidly digested in the gastrointestinal tract because processing disrupts plant tissues and releases the macronutrients. Consequently, it is important to formulate plant-based foods to reduce the levels of nutrients linked to adverse health effects and increase the levels linked to beneficial health effects. Moreover, it is important to design the food matrix so that the macronutrients are not digested and absorbed too quickly, but the micronutrients are highly bioavailable. In this article, we discuss how next-generation plant-based foods can be made healthier by controlling their nutrient profile, digestibility, and bioavailability.",

However, there are few reports on central nervous system tumors, and data on dose-response relationships are lacking. This individual-matched case-control study included 506 cases and 506 controls. The overall plant-based diet index (PDI), the healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and the unhealthy plant-based diet index (uPDI) were calculated using dietary information collected through a food frequency questionnaire, with higher scores indicating better adherence. We analyzed the relationship of plant-based diets with glioma. After adequate adjustment for confounders, PDI was associated with a reduced glioma risk (OR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.24-0.72). Conversely, uPDI was associated with an elevated glioma risk (OR = 8.04, 95% CI: 4.15-15.60). However, hPDI was not significantly associated with glioma risk (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.48-1.45). For subgroups, PDI was not significant in analyzing young age, BMI, or any pathological subtypes. The restricted cubic spline function showed a significant dose-response relationship between PDI (",

      "abstract": "The supplementation of plant-based foods and beverages with bioactive agents may be an important strategy for increasing human healthiness. Numerous kinds of colloidal delivery systems have been developed to encapsulate bioactives with the goal of improving their water dispersibility, chemical stability, and bioavailability. In this review, we focus on colloidal delivery systems assembled entirely from plant-based ingredients, such as lipids, proteins, polysaccharides, phospholipids, and surfactants isolated from botanical sources. In particular, the utilization of these ingredients to create plant-based nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, nanoparticles, and microgels is covered. The utilization of these delivery systems to encapsulate, protect, and release various kinds of bioactives is highlighted, including oil-soluble vitamins (like vitamin D), ω-3 oils, carotenoids (vitamin A precursors), curcuminoids, and polyphenols. The functionality of these delivery systems can be tailored to specific applications by careful selection of ingredients and processing operations, as this enables the composition, size, shape, internal structure, surface chemistry, and electrical characteristics of the colloidal particles to be controlled. The plant-based delivery systems discussed in this article may be useful for introducing active ingredients into the next generation of plant-based foods, meat, seafood, milk, and egg analogs. Nevertheless, there is still a need to systematically compare the functional performance of different delivery systems for specific applications to establish the most appropriate one. In addition, there is a need to test their efficacy at delivering bioavailable forms of bioactives using in vivo studies.",

      "abstract": "Hospitalization is an unparalleled opportunity for physicians to educate patients about the interconnection between poor dietary choices and the occurrence of many chronic diseases. For those patients who are ready to embrace nutrition as an essential part of the healing process, however, it is oftentimes difficult to find healthy menus at hospitals. Meat-based entrées, sugar-sweetened beverages and candy appear to be omnipresent in cafeterias and restaurants at U.S. hospitals. On the other hand, healthy plant-based menus are still the exception rather than the rule. Some states undertook considerable efforts to change this and made plant-based meals the law. Upon request by a patient, hospitals in New York are now required by law to provide plant-based options at every meal. This recent development triggered a controversial discussion within the medical community whether other states should follow this example and make plant-based hospital menus the law as well. This editorial illuminates why mandatory plant-based hospital menus could be a win-win situation for many involved stakeholders, including patients, hospitals and food services. This step is not a loss-marking venture for hospitals but rather a chance to save money and to improve corporate brand marketing at the same time. The introduction of mandatory plant-based menus in hospitals at a large scale represents a unique opportunity at the nexus of health, innovative corporate strategies and economics. Adequate framework conditions are necessary to ensure that all individuals can make healthy and affordable dietary choices while being hospitalized.",

      "title": "Ultrasound-assisted processing: Science, technology and challenges for the plant-based protein industry.",
      "abstract": "The present-day consumer is not only conscious of the relationship between food consumption and positive health, but also keen on environmental sustainability. Thus, the demand for plant-based proteins, which are associated with nutrition and environmental sustainability. However, the plant-based protein industry still demands urgent innovation due to the low yield and long extraction time linked with traditional extraction methods. Although ultrasound is an eco-innovative technique, there exist limited data regarding its impact with plant-based protein. In this paper, the scientific principles of ultrasonication with regards to its application in plant-based protein research were reviewed. After comparing the cavitational and shearing impacts of different ultrasonic parameters, the paper further reviewed its effects on extracted protein characteristics and techno-functional properties. Additionally, current technological challenges and future perspectives of ultrasonication for the plant-based protein industry were also discussed. In summary, this review does not only present the novelty and environmental sustainability of ultrasound as a plant-based protein assisted-extraction method, but also highlights on the correlation between protein source, structure and subsequent functional properties which are important crucial factors for maximum application of ultrasound in the growing plant-based protein market.",

      "title": "Impact of Dairy Products and Plant-Based Alternatives on Dental Health: Food Matrix Effects.",
      "abstract": "The impact of dairy products on dental health has been researched widely and shows an important role of various constituents, as well as the specific product matrix, in maintaining and improving dental health. These include, for instance, the position of lactose as the least cariogenic fermentable sugar, the high levels of calcium and phosphate, the presence of phosphopeptides as well as the antibacterial peptides lactoferrin and lysozyme and high buffering capacity. With plant-based alternatives for dairy products being developed and marketed these days, the specific benefits of dairy products in relation to dental health are often overlooked and most products contain more cariogenic carbohydrates, lack phosphopeptides, and have fewer minerals and less buffering capacity. Comparative studies performed to date indeed suggest that plant-based products do not match dairy counterparts when it comes to maintaining and improving dental health. Careful consideration of these aspects is required in relation to future developments of products and human diets. In this paper, we review the impact of dairy products and plant-based dairy alternatives on dental health.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to fill in the gap regarding the occurrence of mycotoxins in plant-based meat alternatives. Hence, a multi-mycotoxin method (aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, zearalenone, and mycotoxins from the Alternaria alternata genera) was developed followed by an exposure assessment for the Italian consumers' exposure to mycotoxins. A total of 13 meat alternatives samples based on soy, pea, chickpea, lupin, and seitan were analysed. With the exception of seitan, all of the remaining samples were contaminated with one mycotoxin or mixtures of up to seven mycotoxins. The level of contamination was as low as 0.2 μg/kg alternariol methyl ether and as high as 66.9 μg/kg fumonisin B1. To analyse the exposure to mycotoxins due to plant-based meat alternatives consumption we used the consumption meat data from the Food and Agriculture Organization for Italian adult consumers and simulated a full replacement of meat with plant-based meat alternatives. Based on our model, consumption of plant-based meat alternatives led to a non-tolerable exposure to alternariol (hazard index (HI) > 1) in pea-based burger and soy + wheat-based steak, while samples contaminated with aflatoxins, respectively ochratoxin A, indicated a health concern related to liver and renal cancer (margin of exposure (MOE) < 10,000). This is the first study that presents the co-occurrence of mycotoxins in multiple plant-based meat alternatives. Moreover, these results indicate that there is a need for policymakers to consider the regulation of mycotoxins in plant-based meat alternatives in order to ensure consumers' safety.",

      "abstract": "There is a growing need for plant-based yogurts that meet consumer demands in terms of texture. However, more research is required to understand the relationship between physicochemical and mouthfeel properties in plant-based yogurts. The purpose of this study was to determine the physicochemical properties of five commercial plant-based yogurt alternatives with different chemical compositions, making comparisons to dairy yogurts and thick, creamy, thin, and watery mouthfeel sensations. The physicochemical parameters studied included large and small deformation rheology, particle size, soluble solids, acidity, and chemical composition. Significant differences in flow behavior and small deformation rheology were found between dairy- and plant-based yogurts. Among plant-based yogurts thick, creamy, thin, and watery mouthfeel sensations were strongly associated with steady shear rates and apparent viscosity. The results highlight the importance of large deformation rheology to advance the use of plant-based ingredients in the development of yogurt alternatives. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that dairy- and plant-based yogurts with a similar mouthfeel profiles may have different viscoelastic properties, which indicates that instrumental and sensory methods should not be considered substitutive but complementary methods when developing plant-based yogurts in a cost-effective and timely manner.",

Nutrition educators are ideal candidates for delivering SD education to consumers, yet evidence-based recommendations for the profession have not been crafted. The results of a thorough, narrative review of the literature performed in 2021 suggest there are five well-supported recommendations nutrition educators should consider incorporating in their work. They are (1) shift towards a plant-based diet, (2) mitigate food waste, (3) limit consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF), (4) engage in local food systems, and (5) choose sustainable seafood. Each recommendation is discussed below in detail, to provide nutrition educators with a nuanced scope of the issue, after which suggestions for the inclusion of these recommendations, using an example of the authors' experiences from the US Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), are provided.",

      "abstract": "By the beginning of the year 2021, the estimated number of new cancer cases worldwide was about 19.3 million and there were 10.0 million cancer-related deaths. Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide that can be attributed to genetic and environmental factors, including nutrition. The good nutrition concept focuses on the dietary requirements to sustain life. There is a substantial amount of evidence suggesting that a healthy diet can modulate cancer risk, particularly the risk of colorectal and breast cancers. Many studies have evaluated the correlation between our diet and the risk of cancer development, prevention, and treatment. The effect of diet on cancer development is likely to happen through intertwining mechanisms including inflammation and immune responses. For instance, a greater intake of red and processed meat along with low consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers that are implicated in cancer development. On the other hand, the consumption of phytosterols, vitamins, and minerals, which exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles have been linked to lower cancer risk, or even its occurrence prevention. In this book, we aim to summarize the current knowledge on the role of nutrition in cancer to provide the best scientific advice in this regard.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this review paper is to explore the strategies employed to tackle micronutrient deficiencies with illustrations from field-based experience. Hidden hunger is the presence of multiple micronutrient deficiencies (particularly iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A), which can occur without a deficit in energy intake as a result of consuming an energy-dense, but nutrient-poor diet. It is estimated that it affects more than two billion people worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where there is a reliance on low-cost food staples and where the diversity of the diet is limited. Finding a way to improve the nutritional quality of diets for the poorest people is central to meeting the UN sustainable development goals particularly sustainable development goal 2: end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. As we pass the midpoint of the UN's Decade for Action on Nutrition, it is timely to reflect on progress towards achieving sustainable development goal 2 and the strategies to reduce hidden hunger. Many low- and middle-income countries are falling behind national nutrition targets, and this has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other recent shocks to the global food system which have disproportionately impacted the world's most vulnerable communities. Addressing inequalities within the food system must be central to developing a sustainable, cost-effective strategy for improving food quality that delivers benefit to the seldom heard and marginalised communities.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, an increasing body of research has highlighted significant scientific evidence linking adherence to the Mediterranean diet with a reduced risk of chronic diseases. Simultaneously, concerns about the environmental impact of the food system have intensified, particularly considering projected population growth in the coming years. This work introduces a new graphical representation of the traditional Mediterranean dietary model, developed by a dedicated Working Group of the Italian Society of Human Nutrition (SINU). This new model emphasizes plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and extra-virgin olive oil, at its foundation, reflecting their historical and scientific significance in the Mediterranean diet. Animal products, particularly red and processed meats, are de-emphasized, with dairy, white meats, and eggs recommended for moderate, weekly consumption. The pyramid also advocates limiting added sugars, salt, and alcohol to address their links with chronic diseases. Sustainability principles are woven into the framework, prioritizing local, seasonal, and minimally processed foods while discouraging food waste. The pyramid aligns with global recommendations from FAO and WHO, offering a comprehensive guide to adopting a healthy, sustainable dietary lifestyle while preserving cultural traditions and addressing contemporary nutritional and environmental challenges.",

      "title": "The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease: Critical Insights to Better Understand Clinical Outcomes.",
      "abstract": "The gluten-free diet (GFD) remains a complex paradigm in managing celiac disease (CeD) in children and adults, and there are many reasons why GFD adherence should be strict to improve outcomes. However, this is a challenging task for patients, since they need to have access to quality healthcare resources that facilitate optimal GFD adherence. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the GFD, tackling coexisting nutritional deficiencies, and dealing with complex situations, such as seronegative CeD or non-responsive CeD, all require the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. The short- and long-term follow-up of CeD patients should preferably be performed by a combined Gastroenterology and Nutrition service with well-defined quality standards and the multidisciplinary involvement of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and psychologists. Nutritional advice and counseling by an experienced dietitian can reduce the costs associated with long-term follow-up of CeD patients. Likewise, psychological interventions may be essential in specific scenarios where implementing and sustaining a lifelong GFD can cause a significant psychological burden for patients. This manuscript aims to provide guidelines to improve clinical practice in the follow-up and monitoring of CeD patients and provide information on the nutritional risks of an ill-advised GFD. Clinicians, biochemists, food technologists, dietitians, and psychologists with a global view of the disease have been involved in its writing.",

      "title": "Limits of Ultra: Towards an Interdisciplinary Understanding of Ultra-Endurance Running Performance.",
      "abstract": "Ultra-endurance running (UER) poses extreme mental and physical challenges that present many barriers to completion, let alone performance. Despite these challenges, participation in UER events continues to increase. With the relative paucity of research into UER training and racing compared with traditional endurance running distance (e.g., marathon), it follows that there are sizable improvements still to be made in UER if the limitations of the sport are sufficiently understood. The purpose of this review is to summarise our current understanding of the major limitations in UER. We begin with an evolutionary perspective that provides the critical background for understanding how our capacities, abilities and limitations have come to be. Although we show that humans display evolutionary adaptations that may bestow an advantage for covering large distances on a daily basis, these often far exceed the levels of our ancestors, which exposes relative limitations. From that framework, we explore the physiological and psychological systems required for running UER events. In each system, the factors that limit performance are highlighted and some guidance for practitioners and future research are shared. Examined systems include thermoregulation, oxygen delivery and utilisation, running economy and biomechanics, fatigue, the digestive system, nutritional and psychological strategies. We show that minimising the cost of running, damage to lower limb tissue and muscle fatigability may become crucial in UER events. Maintaining a sustainable core body temperature is critical to performance, and an even pacing strategy, strategic heat acclimation and individually calculated hydration all contribute to sustained performance. Gastrointestinal issues affect almost every UER participant and can be due to a variety of factors. We present nutritional strategies for different event lengths and types, such as personalised and evidence-based approaches for varying types of carbohydrate, protein and fat intake in fluid or solid form, and how to avoid flavour fatigue. Psychology plays a vital role in UER performance, and we highlight the need to be able to cope with complex situations, and that specific long and short-term goal setting improves performance. Fatigue in UER is multi-factorial, both physical and mental, and the perceived effort or level of fatigue have a major impact on the ability to continue at a given pace. Understanding the complex interplay of these limitations will help prepare UER competitors for the different scenarios they are likely to face. Therefore, this review takes an interdisciplinary approach to synthesising and illuminating limitations in UER performance to assist practitioners and scientists in making informed decisions in practice and applicable research.",

Furthermore, with the emergence and use of new tools, specifically in synthetic biology, the uses of microorganisms have expanded showing great potential to fulfil many of our dietary needs. In this review, we look at the different applications of microorganisms in food, and examine the history, state-of-the-art and potential to disrupt current foods systems. We cover both the use of microbes to produce whole foods out of their biomass and as cell factories to make highly functional and nutritional ingredients. The technical, economical, and societal limitations are also discussed together with the current and future perspectives.",

      "title": "Analytical Review on Nutritional Deficiencies in Vegan Diets: Risks, Prevention, and Optimal Strategies.",
      "abstract": "Factors like health concerns, environmental issues, and ethics have driven the rapid rise in veganism's popularity over the last decade. While studies confirm that veganism reduces the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, significant challenges persist in meeting nutritional needs. This review identifies critical dietary deficiencies common in vegan diets, including inadequacies in vitamin B12, iron, calcium, vitamin D, Iodine, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids, and explores strategies to mitigate these risks. These deficiencies result in chronic diseases like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. Hence, this review observes the clinical literature to establish causes and will discuss a supplement strategy to enhance these deficiencies. Economic accessibility to fortified foods and supplements poses additional challenges, particularly for low-income individuals or regions with limited access to vegan-friendly products. Addressing these barriers is essential to make vegan diets viable for all. Many of these nutrients, predominantly found in animal products, are difficult to obtain in sufficient amounts through plant-based diets alone, leading to potential health risks like anemia, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders. This study evaluates clinical literature to pinpoint the causes of these deficiencies and examines effective supplementation strategies to address them. Beyond highlighting the challenges, it discusses the environmental benefits of veganism, showing how plant-based diets significantly reduce water usage, land pressure, and greenhouse gas emissions. The study concludes that while a poorly planned vegan diet can lead to nutritional inadequacies, with proper dietary planning and personalized supplementation, vegan diets can support long-term health and promote environmental sustainability. Recommendations from experts are also included for tailoring vegan diets to meet individual health needs effectively.",

      "abstract": "At the beginning of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, global efforts focused on containing the spread of the virus and avoiding contagion. Currently, it is evident that health professionals should deal with the overall health status of COVID-19 survivors. Indeed, novel findings have identified post-COVID-19 syndrome, which is characterized by malnutrition, loss of fat-free mass, and low-grade inflammation. In addition, the recovery might be complicated by persistent functional impairment (i.e., fatigue and muscle weakness, dysphagia, appetite loss, and taste/smell alterations) as well as psychological distress. Therefore, the appropriate evaluation of nutritional status (assessment of dietary intake, anthropometrics, and body composition) is one of the pillars in the management of these patients. On the other hand, personalized dietary recommendations represent the best strategy to ensure recovery. Therefore, this review aimed to collect available evidence on the role of nutrients and their supplementation in post-COVID-19 syndrome to provide a practical guideline to nutritionists to tailor dietary interventions for patients recovering from COVID-19 infections.",

Fasting consists of the catabolism of lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates to maintain blood glucose levels in a normal range. The action mechanisms of fasting were firstly understood in minor organisms and later in humans. Nutritional interventions of caloric restriction could attenuate age-associated epigenetic alterations and could have a protective effect against cellular alterations, promoting longevity and health span. While most fasting studies point out the weight and fat mass decreases, it is important to define specific guidelines for fasting and non-fasting days to enhance adherence, minimize the dropout rates of the interventions, and maximize body composition improvement. Although the panorama of evidence on fasting and caloric restriction is wide, there is a lack of a safe fasting protocol to guide physicians in its prescription. The main goal is to identify a how to use guide, a major posology of fasting, inserted within a huge dietetic personalized strategy leading to an optimal and healthy nutritional status.",

      "abstract": "Cell Competition is a selective process by which viable cells are eliminated from developing or adult tissues by interactions with their neighbors. In many cases, the eliminated cells (losers) display reduced fitness, yet they would be able to sustain tissue growth or maintenance in a homotypic environment, and are only eliminated when confronted with surrounding wild type cells (winners). In addition, cells with oncogenic mutations that do not show reduced fitness can also be eliminated from tissues when surrounded by wild type cells. Depending on the context, transformed cells can also become supercompetitors and eliminate surrounding wild type cells, thereby promoting tumor formation. Several factors have been shown to play essential roles in Cell Competition, including genes relevant in developmental growth, tumor formation and epithelial apico-basal polarity. Recent discoveries, however, suggest that energy metabolism plays a central role in very different models of cell competition. Here we review the involvement of mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism, autophagy and nutritional status in cell competition and discuss the possible implications of this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "Malnutrition affects millions of people globally, especially women, children, and other vulnerable populations. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were set in 2015 to end poverty, protect the planet, and improve the lives and prospects of everyone by 2030. To achieve the SDG goals effective nutrition interventions and programs need to be efficiently delivered to those most in need. Nutrition directly affects 2 SDGs (2 and 3) and indirectly influences five others. In addition, almost all SDGs influence nutrition and thus attaining the SDG goals is also a pre-requisite to achieving the Global Nutrition targets set in 2012. Evidence-based nutrition interventions, for which there is strong evidence of their biological impact, have the potential to directly influence SDGs 2 and 3 if successfully delivered at scale in high-burden countries. Nevertheless, delivery of nutrition programs is a complex process, where policy, government commitment, adequate budget allocation, supplies and delivery systems, training of service providers, informed beneficiaries and program monitoring and evaluation all need to be in place and aligned with each other. Although in the past decade there has been progress in the SDGs that nutrition directly affects, many goals are still off-track, likely due to several pending gaps at policy-level, program-level, and intervention-level. To accelerate the progress toward reaching the SDG goals that are directly influenced by nutrition, countries need to be supported to successfully and sustainably deliver proven interventions and to scale-up and deliver new interventions in new and innovative ways, and the evidence base should be built in promising areas especially integrating (rather than prioritizing over each other) nutrition-specific and sensitive approaches.",

      "abstract": "The food system and climate are closely interconnected. Although most research has focused on the need to adopt a plant-based diet to help mitigate climate change, there is also an urgent need to examine the effects of climate change on food systems to adapt to climate change. A systems approach can help identify the pathways through which climate influences food systems, thereby ensuring that programmes combating malnutrition take climate into account. Although little is known about how climate considerations are currently incorporated into nutrition programming, climate information services have the potential to help target the delivery of interventions for at-risk populations and reduce climate-related disruption during their implementation. To ensure climate services provide timely information relevant to nutrition programmes, it is important to fill gaps in our knowledge about the influence of climate variability on food supply chains. A proposed roadmap for developing climate-sensitive nutrition programmes recommends: (i) research aimed at achieving a better understanding of the pathways through which climate influences diet and nutrition, including any time lags; (ii) the identification of entry points for climate information into the decision-making process for nutrition programme delivery; and (iii) capacity-building and training programmes to better equip public health practitioners with the knowledge, confidence and motivation to incorporate climate resilience into nutrition programmes. With sustained investment in capacity-building, data collection and analysis, climate information services can be developed to provide the data, analyses and forecasts needed to ensure nutrition programmes target their interventions where and when they are most needed.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable nutrition represents a formidable challenge for providing people with healthy, nutritious and affordable food, while reducing waste and impacts on the environment. Acknowledging the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of the food system, this article addresses the main issues related to sustainability in nutrition, existing scientific data and advances in research and related methodologies. Vegetable oils are epitomized as a case study in order to figure out the challenges inherent to sustainable nutrition. Vegetable oils crucially provide people with an affordable source of energy and are essential ingredients of a healthy diet, but entail varying social and environmental costs and benefits. Accordingly, the productive and socioeconomic context encompassing vegetable oils requires interdisciplinary research based on appropriate analyses of big data in populations undergoing emerging behavioral and environmental pressures. Since oils represent a major and growing source of energy at a global level, their role in sustainable nutrition should be considered beyond pure nutritional facts, at the light of soil preservation, local resources and human needs in terms of health, employment and socio-economic development.",

      "abstract": "Water is an essential nutrient that has primarily been considered in terms of its physiological necessity. But reliable access to water in sufficient quantities and quality is also critical for many nutrition-related behaviors and activities, including growing and cooking diverse foods. Given growing challenges to water availability and safety, including climate change, pollution, and infrastructure degradation, a broader conceptualization of water and its diverse uses is needed to sustainably achieve global nutrition targets. Therefore, we review empirical and qualitative evidence describing the linkages between water security (the reliable availability, accessibility, and quality of water for all household uses) and nutrition. Primary linkages include water security for drinking, food production and preparation, infant and young child feeding, and limiting exposure to pathogens and environmental toxins. We then identify knowledge gaps within each linkage and propose a research agenda for studying water security and nutrition going forward, including the concurrent quantification of both food and water availability, accessibility, use, and stability. By making explicit the connections between water security and nutritional well-being, we aim to promote greater collaboration between the nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene sectors. Interdisciplinary policies and programs that holistically address the water-nutrition nexus, versus those that focus on water and nutrition independently, are likely to significantly advance our ability to ensure equitable access to healthy foods and safe water for all.",

      "abstract": "Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are two interrelated fields that explore the influence of genetic diversity on nutrient responses and function. While nutrigenetics investigates the effects of hereditary ge-netic variations on micronutrient metabolism, nutrigenomics examines the intricate relationship between diet and the genome, studying how genetic variants impact nutrient intake and gene expression. These disciplines offer valuable insights into predicting and managing chronic diseases through personalized nutritional approaches. Nutrigenomics employs cutting-edge genomics technologies to study nutrient-genome interactions. Key principles involve genetic variability among ethnic groups, affecting nutrient bioavailability and metabolism, and the influence of dietary choices based on cultural, geographic, and socioeconomic factors. Polymorphisms, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), significantly influence gene activity and are associated with specific phenotypes that are related to micronutrient deficiencies. Minerals are inorganic elements, vital for various physiological functions. Understanding the SNPs associated with mineral deficien-cies is crucial for assessing disease risk and developing personalized treatment plans. This knowledge can inform public health interventions, targeted screening programs, educational campaigns, and fortified food products to address deficiencies effectively. Nutrigenomics research has the potential to revolutionize clinical and nutritional practices, providing personalized recommendations, enhancing illness risk assessment, and advancing public health initiatives. Despite the need for further research, harnessing nutrigenomics' potential can lead to more focused and efficient methods for preventing and treating mineral deficiencies.",

Specifically, the review targeted critical nutritional needs during long-term manned missions in outer space in addition to the essential components of a sustainable space nutrition system for meeting these needs. The search phrase \"space food and the survival of astronauts in long-term missions\" was used to collect the initial 5432 articles from seven Chinese and seven English databases. From these articles, two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts to identify 218 articles for full-text reviews based on three themes and 18 keyword combinations as eligibility criteria. The results suggest that it is possible to address short-term adverse environmental factors and nutritional deficiencies by adopting effective dietary measures, selecting the right types of foods and supplements, and engaging in specific sustainable food production and eating practices. However, to support self-sufficiency during long-term space exploration, the most optimal and sustainable space nutrition systems are likely to be supported primarily by fresh food production, natural unprocessed foods as diets, nutrient recycling of food scraps and cultivation systems, and the establishment of closed-loop biospheres or landscape-based space habitats as long-term life support systems.",

      "abstract": "Sustainable nutrition, equaling earth health, involves a personalized approach designed in terms of precision and avoidance of still cogent but unjustified dogmas, equaling public health. For instance, current dietary recommendations continue to dwell on the need to limit as much as possible the intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA), notwithstanding the mounting evidence that the effects of food on health cannot be predicted from the content of single nutrients without considering the overall macronutrient composition and the role of the food matrix. The traditional recommendation to restrict SFA ignores that their effects on health depend on the interaction between naturally occurring food components and those introduced by food processing. It is warranted to modify the still widely promoted dietary guidelines based upon such single nutrients as SFA and instead personalize dietary habits on the basis of the whole pattern of the food matrix. Accordingly, the double edge of malnutrition, that involves deficiency as well as excess and materializes in many individuals throughout their life course, might be tackled by implementing sustainability, with the additional effect of overcoming global inequalities. Within this context SFA may regain their position of tasty and cheap sources of energy to be adapted to each individual lifestyle.",

The dramatic decrease in the prevalences of stunting and malnutrition in China is the result of rapid economic development and nutrition efforts. The improvement in the Chinese populations' overall health status is consistent with the United Nation Sustainable Development Goal of \"ending hunger, achieving food security and improving nutrition.\" Recent healthy policies, such as \"Outline of the Healthy China 2030 Plan\" and \"Healthy China Action Plan (2019-2030),\" pivot the shift from medical care to nutrition and health promotion, which sets a series of actions and goals that point out direction to China's nutrition policy improvement in the next decade. This paper systematically summarizes the China's nutrition policy environment and governance, implementation and actions of a series of food and nutrition policies, as well as available professional development and public education relevant to the field of nutrition. The challenges and prospects of nutrition actions are also addressed to pave a path for future policy-making and better nutrition improvements to successfully achieve Healthy China 2030.",

      "abstract": "Food security is a matter of global concern, as the supply of food is one of the basic needs, ensuring the survival of the species. The trend of globalization and development of the global economy has shifted the responsible, local consumption patterns towards an increased homogeneity of diets, with food products being disconnected from their source, leading to two major results: (1) increased global consumption and (2) increased uncertainty in the supply chain. To determine what is the nutritional model of Romanians, we developed a questionnaire of 32 questions and distributed it using simple random sampling method. The questionnaire was issued both in physical and digital form and received 1053 responses. The survey was conducted during 2021 and 2022, both in urban and rural areas with the aim of investigating the consumption pattern of the population. The analysis of the questionnaire data reveals overconsumption of animal products, starchy vegetables and bread and pastry products. This nutritional pattern with a high intake in animal protein, correlated with a lack of diversification, is extremely unsustainable, having a negative impact on human health and environmental health.",

These foods have been replacing the consumption of nonprocessed healthy foods. This shift has not only worsened human health by increasing the risk of the development of noncommunicable diseases, but also resulted in environmental perturbations. This review aims to bring awareness of the problems caused by the industrialized food production chain, addressing the negative effects it has on the environment and human health, with special reference to chronic kidney disease (CKD). We discuss possible solutions focusing on the benefits of adopting plant-based diets with low UPF content to promote a sustainable and healthy food production and diet for patients with CKD. For a sustainable future we need to \"connect the dots\" of planetary health, food production, and nutrition in the context of CKD.",

      "abstract": "Unhealthy diets are a major impediment to achieving a healthier population in the United States. Although there is a relatively clear sense of what constitutes a healthy diet, most of the US population does not eat healthy food at rates consistent with the recommended clinical guidelines. An abundance of barriers, including food and nutrition insecurity, how food is marketed and advertised, access to and affordability of healthy foods, and behavioral challenges such as a focus on immediate versus delayed gratification, stand in the way of healthier dietary patterns for many Americans. Food Is Medicine may be defined as the provision of healthy food resources to prevent, manage, or treat specific clinical conditions in coordination with the health care sector. Although the field has promise, relatively few studies have been conducted with designs that provide strong evidence of associations between Food Is Medicine interventions and health outcomes or health costs. Much work needs to be done to create a stronger body of evidence that convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different types of Food Is Medicine interventions. An estimated 90% of the $4.3 trillion annual cost of health care in the United States is spent on medical care for chronic disease. For many of these diseases, diet is a major risk factor, so even modest improvements in diet could have a significant impact. This presidential advisory offers an overview of the state of the field of Food Is Medicine and a road map for a new research initiative that strategically approaches the outstanding questions in the field while prioritizing a human-centered design approach to achieve high rates of patient engagement and sustained behavior change. This will ideally happen in the context of broader efforts to use a health equity-centered approach to enhance the ways in which our food system and related policies support improvements in health.",

      "abstract": "Women exhibit unique vulnerabilities in health, especially regarding mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Biological, hormonal, and metabolic differences contribute to sex-specific risks that remain underrepresented in clinical studies. Diseases such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are more prevalent in women and may be influenced by hormonal transitions, particularly during menopause. Chronic low-grade inflammation is emerging as a shared mechanism underlying both conditions, and this inflammatory state can be worsened by dietary habits. During menopause, mood and sleep disturbances can influence dietary behavior, leading to enhanced snacking and consumption of high-glycemic and comfort foods. Such foods, low in nutritional value, promote weight gain and elevated inflammatory markers. Their consumption combined (or not) with a preexisting Western diet pattern-already linked to inflammation-could reinforce systemic inflammation involving the gut-brain axis. Moreover, the symptoms \"per se\" could act on inflammation as well. Peripheral inflammation may cross the blood-brain barrier, sustaining mood disorders and promoting neurodegenerative changes. Finally, MDD and AD are both associated with conditions such as obesity and diabetes, which occur more frequently in women. The review highlights how menopause-related changes in mood, sleep, and diet may heighten susceptibility to mental and neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Nutrients, required by human bodies to perform life-sustaining functions, are obtained from the diet. They are broadly classified into macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) and water. All nutrients serve as a source of energy, provide structural support to the body and/or regulate the chemical processes of the body. Food and drinks also consist of non-nutrients that may be beneficial (e.g., antioxidants) or harmful (e.g., dyes or preservatives added to processed foods) to the body and the ocular surface. There is also a complex interplay between systemic disorders and an individual's nutritional status. Changes in the gut microbiome may lead to alterations at the ocular surface. Poor nutrition may exacerbate select systemic conditions. Similarly, certain systemic conditions may affect the uptake, processing and distribution of nutrients by the body. These disorders may lead to deficiencies in micro- and macro-nutrients that are important in maintaining ocular surface health. Medications used to treat these conditions may also cause ocular surface changes. The prevalence of nutrition-related chronic diseases is climbing worldwide. This report sought to review the evidence supporting the impact of nutrition on the ocular surface, either directly or as a consequence of the chronic diseases that result. To address a key question, a systematic review investigated the effects of intentional food restriction on ocular surface health; of the 25 included studies, most investigated Ramadan fasting (56%), followed by bariatric surgery (16%), anorexia nervosa (16%), but none were judged to be of high quality, with no randomized-controlled trials.",

      "abstract": "With the presentation of the blueprint of the first human genome in 2001 and the advent of technologies for high-throughput genetic analysis, personalized nutrition (PN) becomes a new scientific field and the first commercial offerings of genotype-based nutrition advice emerge at the same time. Here, the state of evidence for the effect of genetic and epigenetic factors in the development of obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and resulting illnesses such as non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases is summarized. This study also critically value the concepts of PN that are built around the new genetic avenue from both the academic and a commercial perspective and their effectiveness in causing sustained changes in diet, lifestyle, and for improving health. Despite almost 20 years of research and commercial direct-to-consumer offerings, evidence for the success of gene-based dietary recommendations is still generally lacking. This calls for new concepts of future PN solutions that incorporate more phenotypic measures and provide a panel of instruments (e.g., self- and bio-monitoring tools, feedback systems, algorithms based on artificial intelligence) that increases compliance based on the individual´s physical and social environment and value system.",

      "abstract": "The importance of diet and nutrition to military readiness and performance has been recognized for centuries as dietary nutrients sustain health, protect against illness, and promote resilience, performance and recovery. Contemporary military nutrition research is increasingly inter-disciplinary with emphasis often placed on the broad topics of (1) determining operational nutrition requirements in all environments, (2) characterizing nutritional practices of military personnel relative to the required (role/environment) standards, and (3) developing strategies for improving nutrient delivery and individual choices. This review discusses contemporary issues shared internationally by military nutrition research programmes, and highlights emerging topics likely to influence future military nutrition research and policy. Contemporary issues include improving the diet quality of military personnel, optimizing operational rations, and increasing understanding of biological factors influencing nutrient requirements. Emerging areas include the burgeoning field of precision nutrition and its technological enablers.",

Recent advances in how food structure impacts the extent and kinetics of uptake of nutrients and its consequent effects on the physiological outcomes are beginning to shift our understanding of nutrition. This understanding is important to designing future foods that provide optimum nutrient bioavailability and deliver healthy outcomes.

      "abstract": "The Constrained Model of Total Energy Expenditure predicts that increased physical activity may not influence total energy expenditure, but instead, induces compensatory energetic savings in other processes. Much remains unknown, however, about concepts of energy expenditure, constraint and compensation in different populations, and it is unclear whether this model applies to endurance athletes, who expend very large amounts of energy during training and competition. Furthermore, it is well-established that some endurance athletes consciously or unconsciously fail to meet their energy requirements via adequate food intake, thus exacerbating the extent of energetic stress that they experience. Within this review we A) Describe unique characteristics of endurance athletes that render them a useful model to investigate energy constraints and compensations, B) Consider the factors that may combine to constrain activity and total energy expenditure, and C) Describe compensations that occur when activity energy expenditure is high and unmet by adequate energy intake. Our main conclusions are as follows: A) Higher activity levels, as observed in endurance athletes, may indeed increase total energy expenditure, albeit to a lesser degree than may be predicted by an additive model, given that some compensation is likely to occur; B) That while a range of factors may combine to constrain sustained high activity levels, the ability to ingest, digest, absorb and deliver sufficient calories from food to the working muscle is likely the primary determinant in most situations and C) That energetic compensation that occurs in the face of high activity expenditure may be primarily driven by low energy availability i.e., the amount of energy available for all biological processes after the demands of exercise have been met, and not by activity expenditure per se.",

The Nutrition Society of Australia's 2022 Annual Scientific meeting theme 'Sustainable nutrition for a healthy life' was a timely conference focusing on the environmental impact of global, national and local food systems, how nutrition science can promote sustainable eating practices while respecting cultural and culinary diversity and how to ensure optimal nutrition throughout life to prevent and manage chronic diseases. Comprehensive, diverse, collaborative and forward-thinking research was presented in a 3 d programme of keynote presentations, oral and poster sessions, breakfast and lunch symposiums, ending with a panel discussion to answer the question of how we can best achieve a nutritious food supply that supports human and planetary health. We concluded that this complex issue necessitates coordinated efforts and multi-faceted responses at local, national and global levels. Collaboration among consumers, scientists, industry and government using a systems approach is vital for finding solutions to this challenge.",

      "abstract": "Ethical, environmental and health concerns around dairy products are driving a fast-growing industry for plant-based dairy alternatives, but undesirable flavours and textures in available products are limiting their uptake into the mainstream. The molecular processes initiated during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria in dairy products is well understood, such as proteolysis of caseins into peptides and amino acids, and the utilisation of carbohydrates to form lactic acid and exopolysaccharides. These processes are fundamental to developing the flavour and texture of fermented dairy products like cheese and yoghurt, yet how these processes work in plant-based alternatives is poorly understood. With this knowledge, bespoke fermentative processes could be engineered for specific food qualities in plant-based foods. This review will provide an overview of recent research that reveals how fermentation occurs in plant-based milk, with a focus on how differences in plant proteins and carbohydrate structure affect how they undergo the fermentation process. The practical aspects of how this knowledge has been used to develop plant-based cheeses and yoghurts is also discussed.",

      "title": "Plant Proteins: Assessing Their Nutritional Quality and Effects on Health and Physical Function.",
      "abstract": "Consumer demand for plant protein-based products is high and expected to grow considerably in the next decade. Factors contributing to the rise in popularity of plant proteins include: (1) potential health benefits associated with increased intake of plant-based diets; (2) consumer concerns regarding adverse health effects of consuming diets high in animal protein (e.g., increased saturated fat); (3) increased consumer recognition of the need to improve the environmental sustainability of food production; (4) ethical issues regarding the treatment of animals; and (5) general consumer view of protein as a \"positive\" nutrient (more is better). While there are health and physical function benefits of diets higher in plant-based protein, the nutritional quality of plant proteins may be inferior in some respects relative to animal proteins. This review highlights the nutritional quality of plant proteins and strategies for wisely using them to meet amino acid requirements. In addition, a summary of studies evaluating the potential benefits of plant proteins for both health and physical function is provided. Finally, potential safety issues associated with increased intake of plant proteins are addressed.",

      "title": "Review: Quality of animal-source foods.",
      "abstract": "This article critically reviews the current state of knowledge on the quality of animal-source foods according to animal production and food processing conditions, including consumer expectations-behaviours and the effects of consumption of animal-source foods on human health. Quality has been defined through seven core attributes: safety, commercial, sensory, nutritional, technological, convenience, and image. Image covers ethical, cultural and environmental dimensions associated with the origin of the food and the way it is produced and processed. This framework enabled to highlight the priorities given to the different quality attributes. It also helped to identify potential antagonisms and synergies among quality attributes, between production and processing stages, and among stakeholders. Primacy is essentially given to commercial quality attributes, especially for standard commodity animal-source foods. This primacy has strongly influenced genetic selection and farming practices in all livestock commodity chains and enabled substantial quantitative gains, although at the expense of other quality traits. Focal issues are the destructuration of chicken muscle that compromises sensory, nutritional and image quality attributes, and the fate of males in the egg and dairy sectors, which have heavily specialised their animals. Quality can be gained but can also be lost throughout the farm-to-fork continuum. Our review highlights critical factors and periods throughout animal production and food processing routes, such as on-farm practices, notably animal feeding, preslaughter and slaughter phases, food processing techniques, and food formulation. It also reveals on-farm and processing factors that create antagonisms among quality attributes, such as the castration of male pigs, the substitution of marine-source feed by plant-based feed in fish, and the use of sodium nitrite in meat processing. These antagonisms require scientific data to identify trade-offs among quality attributes and/or solutions to help overcome these tensions. However, there are also food products that value synergies between quality attributes and between production and processing phases, particularly Geographical Indications, such as for cheese and dry-cured ham. Human epidemiological studies have found associations between consumption of animal-source foods and increased or decreased risk for chronic non-communicable diseases. These associations have informed public health recommendations. However, they have not yet considered animal production and food processing conditions. A concerted and collaborative effort is needed from scientists working in animal science, food process engineering, consumer science, human nutrition and epidemiology in order to address this research gap. Avenues for research and main options for policy action are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Fuelled by adaptations to clinical trial implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, decentralised clinical trials are burgeoning. Decentralised clinical trials involve many digital tools to facilitate research without physical contact between research teams and participants at various stages, such as recruitment, enrolment, informed consent, administering study interventions, obtaining patient-reported outcome measures, and safety monitoring. These tools can provide ways of ensuring participants' safety and research integrity, while sometimes reducing participant burden and trial cost. Research sponsors and investigators are interested in expanding the use of decentralised clinical trials. The US Food and Drug Administration and other regulators worldwide have issued guidance on how to implement such adaptations. However, there has been little focus on the distinct ethical challenges these trials pose. In this Health Policy report, which is informed by both traditional research ethics and digital ethics frameworks, we group the related ethical issues under three areas requiring increased ethical vigilance: participants' safety and rights, scientific validity, and ethics oversight. Our aim is to describe these issues, offer practical means of addressing them, and prompt the delineation of ethical standards for decentralised trials.",

It is a fundamental element of our culture and traditions, and gives rise to numerous controversies, trends and social movements. Currently, there are many dilemmas raised by its production and consumption, from ethical and moral to environmental, economic and health. This paper focuses on examining and analysing some of these dilemmas, related to ethical and socio-cultural issues, animal welfare, sustainability and meat alternatives, from a consumer perspective and their impact on current and future meat consumption. In the coming years, the meat sector will have to face many challenges to ensure its survival, particularly in terms of the ethical aspects of meat consumption and the environmental impact of meat production. Listening to society's demands, adapting to them, and communicating progress in a truthful and transparent manner are probably the keys to success and to the future of meat.",

      "abstract": "With the continuous rise of Muslim and Jewish populations and their increasing preference for ritually slaughtered poultry meat, the industry is forced to redefine its existing product-centric quality standard toward a new consumer-centric dimension of quality. The new dimension is mainly attributed to ensuring animal welfare and ethical treatment (ethical quality), spiritual quality (such as halal status, cleanliness), and eating quality standards set by religion. To meet consumer quality requirements while maintaining high production performance, the industry has incorporated newer technologies that are compatible with religious regulations such as stunning methods like electrical water bath stunning. However, the introduction of new techniques such as electrical water bath stunning has been met with mixed reactions. Some religious scholars have banned the use of any stunning methods in religious slaughter, as halal status is believed to be compromised in cases where birds have been stunned to death before slaughter. Nevertheless, some studies have shown the positive side of the electrical water bath stunning procedure in terms of preserving eating, ethical, and spiritual quality. Therefore, the present study aims to critically analyze the application of various aspects of electrical water bath stunning such as current intensity and frequency on various quality attributes, namely, ethical, spiritual, and eating quality of poultry meat.",

Using a scoping review, we describe published updates to address disparities and targets for interventions to improve gaps in care within allergy and immunology. These disparities-related studies provide a broad view of our current understanding of how social determinants of health threaten patient outcomes and our ability to advance health equity efforts in our field. We outline next steps to improve access to care and advance health equity for patients with allergic/immunologic diseases through actions taken at the individual, community, and policy levels, which could be applied outside of our field. Key among these are efforts to increase the diversity among our trainees, providers, and scientific teams and enhancing efforts to participate in advocacy work and public health interventions. Addressing health disparities requires advancing our understanding of the interplay between social and structural barriers to care and enacting the needed interventions in various key areas to effect change.",

      "title": "Is it ethical to advertise unhealthy foods to children?",
      "abstract": "The marketing of foods and non-alcoholic beverages (hereafter: food) high in fats, salt and/or sugar (HFSS) has been strongly implicated in the rising levels of childhood obesity worldwide. Multiple ethical concerns arise from the practice of exposing children to such marketing and efforts to monitor and restrict it through regulatory policies. There is considerable evidence that exposure to powerful food marketing messages affects children's food behaviours in ways that are detrimental to good dietary health. Children are particularly vulnerable to being exploited and deceived by food marketing messages based on their cognitive and developmental immaturity. HFSS food marketing also affects numerous child rights enshrined within the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (of which the UK is a signatory) including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. The debate has become somewhat polarised between the public health community's evidence-based assertion that all marketing is inherently exploitative and the rebuttal from food and marketing industry stakeholders that provided the marketing is 'accurate and truthful' and there is no ethical need to regulate. This polarisation is reflected in the complexity of policymaking decisions regarding the rationale for mandatory government-led policies or industry self-regulation. There are also ethical considerations inherent in the monitoring of children's food marketing exposure, particularly in the digital sphere, by researchers for the purposes of informing policy design, scope and implementation. This review paper will explore the latest evidence on these issues and consider the implications for public health research, policy, and practice.",

      "abstract": "A good, nutritious diet is essential for the health and well-being of our domestic pets. Today, most pet dogs and cats are fed highly processed food bearing little resemblance to canine and feline ancestral diets. Additives are included in processed pet food to provide nutritional benefits, ensure food safety, and maintain the desirable features of colour, flavour, texture, stability and resistance to spoilage. This paper reviews the safety of various additives in processed pet food. Labelling, safety assessment, and ethical concerns regarding existing toxicity testing procedures are also considered. The adequacy of testing for many additives and the scientific basis for determining safety are questioned. Additives can be synthetic or 'natural' although the distinction can be blurred when naturally derived substances are synthesised in the laboratory, or extracted using a high level of physical and chemical processing. Although additives play important roles in processed food production, updated strategies and technologies may be required to establish their safety in the pet food industry.",

El contenido del presente documento fue definido, revisado y aprobado por el actual Comité de Conflictos de Intereses (Comité CDI), comisionado por la SLAN y conformado por miembros de la academia que comparten la convicción sobre la necesidad de evitar CDI en las acciones dirigidas a la nutrición y la salud. El poder e interferencia de los actores comerciales sobre el sistema alimentario y las políticas en salud ha aumentado a través del tiempo, debilitando y obstruyendo la aplicación de las acciones que promueven entornos alimentarios saludables. Una de las estrategias mediante las cuales operan las corporaciones dedicadas al desarrollo, comercialización, mercadotecnia y publicidad de productos comestibles y bebibles que dañan la salud es el establecimiento de relaciones con sociedades y organizaciones de nutrición para lograr sus objetivos de menoscabar dichas acciones, lo que puede dar lugar a CDI. A través de este documento, la SLAN propone una serie de medidas que permitan prevenir, transparentar y gestionar los conflictos de interés, así como evitar la interferencia de los actores comerciales en la investigación, educación y políticas de la nutrición.",

It recognizes that all people will enjoy the guarantees granted by the Constitution, which may not be restricted or suspended, except in some cases and under the conditions that it herself establishes.On the centenary of the promulgation of its Magna Carta, Mexico is experiencing a deep economic, political, social and governmental crisis, and the consequent loss of access to fundamental human rights to survive.Among the effects of this situation, 44 million people are in the age of preparing to enter the labor market and sustain the Mexican economy for the next four decades. However, their economic situation prevents them from having the resources required to access adequate food, pay educational expenses and enter the labor market.This reality makes it essential to explore the possible causes that have originated these circumstances and propose viable alternatives that alleviate &#8211; in the medium term &#8211; the immense deficiencies of the Mexicans and recover the hope that there will be possibilities of a lasting life.",

      "abstract": "The typical Western diet, high in processed and animal-based foods, is nutritionally and ethically problematic. Beyond the well-documented cruelty to animals that characterizes the practices of the factory-farming industry, current patterns of meat consumption contribute to medical and moral harm in humans on both an individual level and a public health scale. We aim to deconstruct, by highlighting their fallacies, the common positive and normative arguments that are used to defend current nutritional patterns. Animal-based foods promote the mechanisms that underlie chronic cardiometabolic disease, whereas whole-food plant-based nutrition can reverse them. Factory farming of animals also contributes to climate change, antibiotic resistance, and the spread of infectious diseases. Finally, the current allocation of nutritional resources in the United States is unjust. A societal shift toward more whole-food plant-based patterns of eating stands to provide significant health benefits and ethical advantages, and the medical profession has a duty to advocate accordingly. Although it remains important for individuals to make better food choices to promote their own health, personal responsibility is predicated on sound advice and on resource equity, including the availability of healthy options. Nutrition equity is a moral imperative and should be a top priority in the promotion of public health.",

      "title": "Meat alternatives: A proofed commodity?",
      "abstract": "The demand for meat alternatives has been growing in the recent years and it is expected to keep expanding. Motives driving this growth are diverse and are mostly related to the health and ethical concerns over animal welfare and the possible impact of meat production on the environment. Meat alternatives are not anymore a niche market (i.e., vegetarians and vegans) but going mainstream (also consumed by meat eaters and flexitarians). This can be attributed to advances in formulations and ingredients and innovative technologies resulting in improved quality of products. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge about meat alternatives (from plant, fungi or/and algae). Plant-based alternatives are already a proofed commodity with a wide range of products available in the market. The search for more sustainable sources had put the spotlight on other sources such as fungi and algae due to their limited need to land, energy and water for biomass production. Fungi-based alternatives are steps ahead of those algae-based owing to fungi neutral flavor, comparable nutritional profile to meat and no need to masking agents. Consumer acceptance is still a key challenge boosting research and development efforts to ensure a better quality, affordability, and sustainability.",

      "abstract": "Pollution by chemicals and waste impacts human and ecosystem health on regional, national, and global scales, resulting, together with climate change and biodiversity loss, in a triple planetary crisis. Consequently, in 2022, countries agreed to establish an intergovernmental science-policy panel (SPP) on chemicals, waste, and pollution prevention, complementary to the existing intergovernmental science-policy bodies on climate change and biodiversity. To ensure the SPP's success, it is imperative to protect it from conflicts of interest (COI). Here, we (i) define and review the implications of COI, and its relevance for the management of chemicals, waste, and pollution; (ii) summarize established tactics to manufacture doubt in favor of vested interests, i.e., to counter scientific evidence and/or to promote misleading narratives favorable to financial interests; and (iii) illustrate these with selected examples. This analysis leads to a review of arguments for and against chemical industry representation in the SPP's work. We further (iv) rebut an assertion voiced by some that the chemical industry should be directly involved in the panel's work because it possesses data on chemicals essential for the panel's activities. Finally, (v) we present steps that should be taken to prevent the detrimental impacts of COI in the work of the SPP. In particular, we propose to include an independent auditor's role in the SPP to ensure that participation and processes follow clear COI rules. Among others, the auditor should evaluate the content of the assessments produced to ensure unbiased representation of information that underpins the SPP's activities.",

Nutrition therapy is a medical intervention, which requires an indication for achieving a treatment goal and the informed consent of the competent patient. Withholding and withdrawing nutrition therapy and artificial hydration must be evaluated in specific situations (terminally ill, palliative care, dementia, aged patients) and always case by case according to the patients' cultural and spiritual needs. In the case of ethical issues or dilemmas, application of the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice is recommended. These principles assist the caregiver in the decision as whether to feed or not to feed. Caregivers must emphasize the right to self-determination and thus to respect the autonomy of the patient, and also the particular vulnerability of the patient suffering from or at risk of malnutrition. Caregivers must be ethically capable of responding to the nutritional needs according to the patient's will and desires even if the patient is not capable of self-determination, always looking for the best benefit to the patient and avoiding harm.",

      "abstract": "Rivers are critical, but often overlooked, parts of food systems. They have multiple functions that support the food security, nutrition, health and livelihoods of the communities surrounding them. However, given current unsustainable food system practices, damming and climate change, the majority of the world's largest rivers are increasingly susceptible to environmental degradation, with negative implications for the communities that rely on them. Here we describe the dynamism and multifaceted nature of rivers as food environments (i.e. the place within food systems where people obtain their food) and their role in securing food security including improved diets and overall health. We also provide a conceptual framework that explain rivers as food environments within the broader food system and describe approaches to characterizing these food environments to better inform our understanding of how they influence food security and nutrition outcomes. Applying this framework to the Mekong River in Cambodia, we describe rivers as multifaceted wild food environments embedded within ecosystems, sociocultural and political environments and sectors of influence. We also explain the ways in which individual factors might influence how communities interact with this food environment. Developing and articulating food-related, ecosystem-specific frameworks and their constructs can guide implementation of policies aimed to improve specific public health or environmental sustainability outcomes. Our conceptual framework incorporates the multiple dimensions of rivers, which will aid future work and public health policy framing to better describe, understand and intervene to ensure protection of rivers' biodiversity and ecosystems as well as food security, health and livelihoods.",

      "abstract": "Concerns about animal welfare and sustainable meat production are growing among consumers. The awareness of carbon emissions linked to livestock and ethical concerns have triggered interest in more sustainable meat alternatives, among which cultured meat (also known as laboratory grown meat) is a recent entry. Like any new food, the ultimate success of cultured meat depends on consumer acceptance. This study analyses the peer-reviewed literature on consumer attitudes towards cultured meat to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. A systematic literature review was undertaken using the Web of Science, Science Direct and Scopus databases over 2008-2020, resulting in a final number of 43 articles meeting our selection criteria. The most important factors influencing consumer acceptance/rejection of cultured meat include public awareness, perceived naturalness, and food-related risk perception. Ethical and environmental concerns prompted consumers to be willing to pay a premium price for purchasing meat substitutes, but not necessarily cultured meat. Also, food neophobia and uncertainties about safety and health seem to be important barriers to uptake of this technology. Availability of other alternatives such as plant-based meat substitutes and product features, such as price and sensory appeal, are considered determinants of consumer reception of this technology. The effect of demographic factors is mixed. More research on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security, and alternative meat products is recommended.",

      "title": "Recognizing the ethical complexity of food policies and the role of the food industry.",
      "abstract": "Restrictive food policies are often contentious and controversial. Supporters of these policies view them as imperative for achieving public health aims while some opponents view them as overly paternalistic, infringing on consumer choice and potentially inequitable. As a consequence, their ethical status and permissibility are both contested and of importance in decision-making for policy. Traditional ethical analysis of these interventions has examined the ethical implications of the policies according to a direct, linear view of the relationships between government and consumer and the impact of government policy on the consumer. However, this approach to ethical analysis fails to take into account the role of the food industry as the subjects of the policies and intermediaries between government and consumers in the implementation and effectiveness of the policies. The actions of the food industry in response to a policy substantially determine how the policy translates to changes in the food supply and thus, the effect of the policy on consumers. This has significant implications for the ethical status of the policy. As a result, this article calls for complicating the common ethical approach to restrictive food policies by adopting a framing that recognizes the role of the food industry in the implementation of these policies. We then discuss three implications this framing has for ethical analysis: first that ethical analysis must be more nuanced and recognize the potentially complex outcomes of a policy, second that it must be dynamic and ongoing and third that underlying assumptions about policies' effects on choice, effectiveness and equity need to be reconsidered.",

      "abstract": "This study focuses on the details of consumer response to lab grown 'cultured meat (CM)', compared to meat derived from insects, plants and animals. A sample of 254 New Zealanders were interviewed. A word association exercise revealed that consumer reaction to CM was dominated by affective, rather than cognitive factors. The linkages between a general food neophobia scale, a specific CM evaluation scale and purchase intent were studied. The general neophobia scale performed poorly as a predictor, while the 19-point CM evaluation scale performed well. Reducing this scale to its seven affective components, and then to just the two key affective components did not significantly reduce the scale's predictive performance. Overall, the results of this research reveal very significant differences in preference for meat products based upon their origins. Insect protein was strongly disfavoured over all alternatives, while cultured meat was significantly disfavoured compared to more established alternatives. The implications of this for the commercialisation of CM are discussed.",

In recent years, food allergy management has increasingly involved conversations about food oral immunotherapy (OIT). Although ethical considerations of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice implicitly inform these conversations, applying these principles can be complex, particularly in young children. Families of young children assume a role of surrogate decision-maker and must balance immediate risks with the hope of longer-term benefits.",

Tuna meat is rich in essential nutrients such as amino acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and trace minerals. The huge volume of solid and liquid sidestreams generated during the processing stages of tuna is creating environmental and socioeconomic challenges in coastal areas. Different products such as fish meal, protein hydrolysates, collagen, enzymes, oil, and bone powder can be produced from tuna sidestreams. Using different nutrient recovery technologies like enzymatic hydrolysis, chemical processing, and green technologies, various categories of product value chains can be created in line with the conventional processing industry. This review attempts to provide a route map for the tuna industry for achieving the circular blue-bioeconomic objectives and reorient the irregular utilization pattern into a sustainable and inclusive path.",

      "abstract": "Health, environmental and ethical concerns have resulted in a dramatic increase in demand for plant-based dairy analogues. While the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) responsible for the characteristic flavours of dairy-based products have been extensively studied, little is known about how to reproduce such flavours using only plant-based substrates. As a first step in their development, this review provides an overview of the VOCs associated with fermented (bacteria and/or fungi/yeast) vegetable and fruit substrates. Following PRISMA guidelines and using two English databases (Web of Science and Scopus), thirty-five suitable research papers were identified. The number of fermentation-derived VOCs detected ranged from 32 to 118 (across 30 papers), while 5 papers detected fewer (10 to 25). Bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria (LAB), fungi, and yeast were the micro-organisms used, with LAB being the most commonly reported. Ten studies used a single species, 21 studies used a single type (bacteria, fungi or yeast) of micro-organisms and four studies used mixed fermentation. The nature of the fermentation-derived VOCs detected (alcohols, aldehydes, esters, ketones, acids, terpenes and norisoprenoids, phenols, furans, sulphur compounds, alkenes, alkanes, and benzene derivatives) was dependent on the composition of the vegetable/fruit matrix, the micro-organisms involved, and the fermentation conditions.",

These factors determine how different social groups are exposed to beneficial and/or harmful microorganisms, meaning microbial exposure has an important socioecological justice context. Therefore, greater consideration of microbial exposure and social equity in research, planning, and policy is imperative. Here, we identify 20 research questions considered fundamentally important to promoting equitable exposure to beneficial microorganisms, along with safeguarding resilient societies and ecosystems. The 20 research questions we identified span seven broad themes, including the following: (i) sociocultural interactions; (ii) Indigenous community health and well-being; (iii) humans, urban ecosystems, and environmental processes; (iv) human psychology and mental health; (v) microbiomes and infectious diseases; (vi) human health and food security; and (vii) microbiome-related planning, policy, and outreach. Our goal was to summarize this growing field and to stimulate impactful research avenues while providing focus for funders and policymakers.",

      "title": "Review: Ethical responsibilities and transformation strategies of focal companies in the meat supply chain: the implementation dilemma.",
      "abstract": "In Germany (and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries), the need for a fundamental transformation of livestock farming has become increasingly evident in recent years. Two broad-based stakeholder commissions including the German farmers' association, the meat industry, and Non-Governmental Organizations have endorsed this demand. Nevertheless, major steps towards its implementation are still missing - a circumstance we refer to in this paper as the implementation dilemma. In a globalised economy, farmers cannot solve the problem of low animal welfare standards alone although they are important actors. Moreover, consumer behaviour is changing too slowly, and possibilities for granting more subsidies are limited in the face of multiple economic crises. Against this background, we argue for a stronger focus on voluntary (private) sustainability agreements. We therefore analyse how the German meat supply chain is organised and what responsibility and power the individual actors have to push the sector's transformation. Large slaughterhouses, processors, and the retailing sector seem promising due to their high market concentration and power. Especially retailers can influence the transformation of the market through their role as gatekeepers between suppliers and consumers. Based on business ethics principles of taking responsibility, we consider the focus on sustainability obligations of the retail sector to be ethically justified. However, it is then necessary to give the four retail groups dominating the meat chain in Germany more leeway for sustainability agreements in antitrust law.",

      "abstract": "Food consumption patterns are changing as consumers are becoming more aware and interested in sustainable and ethical food production practices. The growing disconnect between primary (livestock) agriculture and society reinforces the importance of research examining the motivations behind consumer purchase behaviors. However, evidence that links latent consumer psychometric factors and observed heterogeneity in concerns for agriculture to individual food purchase intentions remains scarce. We employ large-scale survey data and an advanced Structural Equation Modelling approach to identify and estimate the direct and indirect effects of latent fundamental values and observed consumer characteristics on individuals' attitudes and purchase intentions for certified humane (CH), organic, and non-hormone added labeled meat products. Our findings suggest that human values, including self-transcendence and openness to change, drive farm animal welfare concerns and individuals' choices of certified meat products. Information and engagement in social media positively affect individuals' perceptions and concerns for farm animal welfare. Individuals guided by altruistic and anti-anthropocentric norms are more oriented towards sustainable and ethical food shopping behaviors.",

      "abstract": "Cellular agriculture is a rapidly emerging field, within which cultured meat has attracted the majority of media attention in recent years. An equally promising area of cellular agriculture, and one that has produced far more actual food ingredients that have been incorporated into commercially available products, is the use of cellular hosts to produce soluble proteins, herein referred to as precision cellular agriculture (PCAg). In PCAg, specific animal- or plant-sourced proteins are expressed recombinantly in unicellular hosts-the majority of which are yeast-and harvested for food use. The numerous advantages of PCAg over traditional agriculture, including a smaller carbon footprint and more consistent products, have led to extensive research on its utility. This review is the first to survey proteins currently being expressed using PCAg for food purposes. A growing number of viable expression hosts and recent advances for increased protein yields and process optimization have led to its application for producing milk, egg, and muscle proteins; plant hemoglobin; sweet-tasting plant proteins; and ice-binding proteins. Current knowledge gaps present research opportunities for optimizing expression hosts, tailoring posttranslational modifications, and expanding the scope of proteins produced. Considerations for the expansion of PCAg and its implications on food regulation, society, ethics, and the environment are also discussed. Considering the current trajectory of PCAg, food proteins from any biological source can likely be expressed recombinantly and used as purified food ingredients to create novel and tailored food products.",

      "title": "The impact of climate change on eating disorders: An urgent call for research.",
      "abstract": "Climate change affects many of the documented risk factors for eating disorders (EDs) through direct and indirect pathways, yet to date the research in this area is nonexistent. Our aim is to identify the specific mechanisms through which climate change might be associated with increased risk for EDs, an exacerbation in symptoms, or poor clinical outcomes; highlight limited empirical data addressing these issues; and propose directions for a research program in this important area. Pathways for the impact of climate change on eating disorders and related data were reviewed. Four main pathways for the effects of climate change on EDs were identified including (1) decreased food access and security; (2) changes in mean temperature; (3) concerns related to food safety and eco-anxiety; and (4) indirect pathways through trauma, adversity, and increased mental health concerns. Except for the relationship between increased food insecurity and EDs, these pathways remain largely uninvestigated. Numerous factors may be implicated in the relationship between climate change and EDs. Future work in this area is imperative and should be conducted through a social justice lens with particular attention paid to the global areas most impacted by climate change and related vulnerabilities. Climate change will likely have adverse impacts on individuals with eating disorders and increase the risk for eating disorders. This paper reviews the different ways in which climate change may have these effects and calls for researchers to pay attention to this important area.",

      "abstract": "Achieving ethically responsible decisions is crucial for the success of biodiversity conservation projects. We adapted the ethical matrix, decision tree, and Bateson's cube to assist in the ethical analysis of complex conservation scenarios by structuring these tools so that they can implement the different value dimensions (environmental, social, and animal welfare) involved in conservation ethics. We then applied them to a case study relative to the decision-making process regarding whether or not to continue collecting biomaterial on the oldest of the two remaining northern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), a functionally extinct subspecies of the white rhinoceros. We used the ethical matrix to gather ethical pros and cons and as a starting point for a participatory approach to ethical decision-making. We used decision trees to compare the different options at stake on the basis of a set of ethical desiderata. We used Bateson's cube to establish a threshold of ethical acceptability and model the results of a simple survey. The application of these tools proved to be pivotal in structuring the decision-making process and in helping reach a shared, reasoned, and transparent decision on the best option from an ethical point of view among those available.",

      "abstract": "Research into dairy-free alternative products, whether plant-based or cell-based, is growing fast and the food industry is facing a new challenge of creating innovative, nutritious, accessible, and natural dairy-free cheese alternatives. The market demand for these products is continuing to increase owing to more people choosing to reduce or eliminate meat and dairy products from their diet for health, environmental sustainability, and/or ethical reasons. This review investigates the current status of dairy product alternatives. Legume proteins have good technological properties and are cheap, which gives them a strong commercial potential to be used in plant-based cheese-like products. However, few legume proteins have been explored in the formulation, development, and manufacture of a fully dairy-free cheese because of their undesirable properties: heat stable anti-nutritional factors and a beany flavor. These can be alleviated by novel or traditional and economical techniques. The improvement and diversification of the formulation of legume-based cheese alternatives is strongly suggested as a low-cost step towards more sustainable food chains. © 2021 The Authors.

      "abstract": "As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic posed a huge challenge to global public health, emphasis on personal hygiene caused extraordinary daily use of detergents and household cleaning products. Since antibacterial cleaning products have the capacity to change the environmental microbiome, increased exposure to household disinfectants could be associated with alterations in human microbiota composition and function. Moreover, the emerging links between household cleaning products and occurrence of non-communicable diseases and antibiotic resistance may involve the gut microbiome. The mediating effects of disturbed gut microbiota on associations between home use of cleaning products and life-long health consequences have been documented in some observational studies. Regarding the evidence associated reduction in exposure to non-pathogenic commensal bacteria and gut dysbiosis, further study is required to assess the effect of massive use of cleaning products during COVID-19 pandemic on long-term host health mediated by the altered microbiota. In this context, recommendations to consume probiotics and fermented foods might reverse the consequences by alleviating dysbiosis.",

Our earlier research has found that fire toxicants not only remain on firefighters' PPE, but are also tracked back to fire stations. The UK Firefighter Contamination Survey assesses firefighters' risk of developing cancer due to occupational exposure to fire toxins. Over 4% of surveyed firefighters were found to have a cancer diagnosis, with the age-specific cancer rate up to 323% higher (35-39 year olds) than that of the general population. Firefighters who had served ≥ 15 years were 1.7 times more likely to develop cancer than those who had served less time. Firefighters were at least twice as likely to be diagnosed with cancer if they noticed soot in their nose/throat (odds ratio (OR) = 2.0, 1.1-3.5), or remained in their PPE for more than four hours after attending a fire incident (OR = 2.3, 1.1-5.2). Also associated with an increased likelihood of cancer was: eating while wearing PPE (OR = 1.8, 1.2-2.7); failing to store clean/dirty PPE separately (OR = 1.3, 1.0-1.7); working in a station that smells of fire (OR = 1.3, 1.0-1.8) or not having designated (separated) clean and dirty areas (OR = 1.4, 1.1-1.7); using an on-site washing machine to launder fire hoods (OR = 1.3, 1.0-1.7); feeling that cleaning is not taken seriously at work (OR = 1.5, 1.2-2.0).",

      "abstract": "Eating-related content is common on TikTok, a popular video-based social media platform, but studies of eating-related content on TikTok are limited. Given the documented association between social media use and disordered eating, investigation of eating-related content on TikTok is needed. One subset of popular eating-related content is \"What I Eat in a Day\" (#WhatIEatInADay), in which a creator documents the food they eat over the assumed span of a single day. We sought to evaluate the content of TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos (N = 100) using reflexive thematic analysis. Two primary types of videos emerged. First, Lifestyle videos (N = 60), which included aesthetic elements, presentations of clean eating, stylized meals, promotion of weight loss and the thin ideal, normalization of eating as a fat woman, and disordered eating content. Second, Eating Only videos (N = 40), which were primarily focused on food, and included upbeat music, an emphasis on highly palatable foods, displays of irony, emojis, and excessive consumption of food. Because viewing eating-related social media content has been associated with disordered eating, both types of TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos may be harmful to vulnerable youth. Given the popularity of TikTok and #WhatIEatinADay, clinicians and researchers should consider the potential impact of this trend. Future research should examine the impact of viewing TikTok #WhatIEatInADay videos on disordered eating risk factors and behaviors.",

      "abstract": "\"Clean eating\" is an increasingly popular diet trend in Western countries with links to disordered eating behaviors. However, the definition of \"clean\" is a highly contentious issue. Negowetti, Ambwani, Karr, Rodgers, and Austin explore this important issue from a U.S. perspective conducting a scoping review of the public health implications of the use of \"clean\" labels on food, including legal and policy implications. The review showed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken little action to address regulation of the use of \"clean\" dietary labels. Our own brief investigations suggest that the landscape in Australia under the Food Standards Australia New Zealand authority is similar. We discuss recommendations made by Negowetti et al. to address this issue in the United States, such as the FDA providing industry guidance on the term \"clean,\" and the issuing of warning letters to companies who contravene this guidance. However, we predict that educating consumers to be more critical of unsubstantiated food labels in public health campaigns will be the most efficient way to change consumer behavior and address the \"clean eating\" diet trend. We also encourage eating disorder researchers and clinicians to be an influential part of this discussion.",

      "abstract": "Social media platforms have become part of many people's lives. Users are spending more and more time on these platforms, creating an active and passive digital footprint through their interaction. This footprint has high research potential in many research areas because understanding people's communication on social media is essential in understanding their values, attitudes, experiences and behaviors. Researchers found that the use of social networking sites impacts adolescents' eating behavior. If we define adolescents as individuals between ages 10 and 24 (WHO's definition), 76% of USA young people at age 18-⁠24 use Instagram, so the Instagram social network analysis is important for understanding young people's expressions in the context of healthy food. This study aims to identify the main topic associated with healthy food on the Instagram social network via hashtag and community analysis based on 2,045,653 messages created by 427,936 individual users. The results show that users most associate Healthy food with healthy lifestyle, fitness, weight loss and diet. In terms of food, these are foods that are Vegan, Homemade, Clean and Plant-based. Given that young people change their behavior in relation to people's behavior on social networks, it is possible to use this data to predict their future association with healthy food characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Negowetti et al. (2021) have provided insightful perspectives on the public health implications of the labeling of \"clean\" dietary products in the United States through a scoping review, along with feasible strategies to counteract the risks of this trend. Although the European Union has already fairly strict regulations about declaration of ingredients and health claims regarding food that makes it almost impossible to label food products as \"clean,\" the clean eating trend is alive and expanding in Europe, and usage of expressions such as \"clean\" or \"pure\" in other ways than on the label may convey similar messages that cannot be regulated by law. Increased regulation, legislation, and information through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as suggested by Negowetti et al. (2021) is a welcome contribution and will certainly help to prevent some misinformation. However, labels are just one battle field in addressing misleading expressions and trends. Scientists should enter the relevant fields (e.g., Internet, TV, and social media) to a higher extent and provide solid, pedagogical and simple facts, and guidelines to vaccinate people against current and upcoming misleading dietary trends.",

      "abstract": "Environmental exposure to a mixture of chemical xenobiotics acts as a double-edged sword, promoting or suppressing tumorigenesis and the development of breast cancer (BC). Before anything else, we are what we eat. In this review, we highlight both \"the good\" and \"the bad\" sides of the daily human diet and dietary patterns that could influence BC risk (BCR) and incidence. Thus, regularly eating new, diversified, colorful, clean, nutrient-rich, energy-boosting, and raw food, increases apoptosis and autophagy, antioxidation, cell cycle arrest, anti-inflammation, and the immune response against BC cells. Moreover, a healthy diet could lead to a reduction in or the inhibition of genomic instability, BC cell stemness, growth, proliferation, invasion, migration, and distant metastasis. We also emphasize that, in addition to beneficial compounds, our food is more and more contaminated by chemicals with harmful effects, which interact with each other and with endogenous proteins and lipids, resulting in synergistic or antagonistic effects. Thus, a healthy and diverse diet, combined with appropriate nutritional behaviors, can exert anti-carcinogenic effects and improve treatment efficacy, BC patient outcomes, and the overall quality of life of BC patients.",

      "abstract": "The present study examined the relationship between posting or viewing fitspiration and clean eating imagery in relation to body image, disordered eating, and compulsive exercise among women. Participants (269 women aged 18-30 years) who posted and/or viewed fitspiration, clean eating or travel imagery on Instagram completed an online cross-sectional questionnaire. Results showed engaging with fitspiration and clean eating material (either posting or viewing) was significantly positively associated with increased levels of compulsive exercise and athletic-ideal internalization. However, only viewing (not posting) fitspiration and clean eating content was significantly related to thin-ideal internalization and disordered eating symptomatology. Athletic-ideal internalization mediated the relationships between posting fitspiration/clean eating and disordered eating symptomatology and compulsive exercise. Both thin-ideal internalization and athletic-ideal internalization mediated the relationship between viewing fitspiration/clean eating material and disordered eating and compulsive exercise. Overall, the findings suggest that viewing fitspiration and clean eating content on Instagram is negatively associated with thin-ideal internalization and disordered eating symptomatology, however the same relationships do not exist for people who frequently post these types of material. The mediational pathways provide a nuanced understanding of how engaging with fitspiration and clean eating material on social media influences female users' body image and health behaviour.",

      "title": "Dishwashing sponges and brushes: Consumer practices and bacterial growth and survival.",
      "abstract": "Sponges are frequently used in kitchens and have been shown to harbor large numbers of bacteria, occasionally also pathogens. Less is known about kitchen brushes regarding usage and presence of bacteria. In the present study, the use of sponges and brushes was studied in a survey among 9966 European consumers in ten countries, and growth and survival of bacteria in sponges and brushes were examined in laboratory experiments. Sponges were the preferred hand-cleaning utensils for washing-up in the majority of countries, while brushes were most frequently used in Denmark and Norway. Consumers mostly change their sponges at regular times, but also sensory cues (looks dirty, smelly, slimy) and usage occurrences such as wiping up meat juices may trigger replacement. Besides cleaning the dishes, over a quarter of the dish brush users also use it to clean a chopping board after soilage from chicken meat juices. The water uptake and drying rate varied considerably, both between different sponges and between brushes and sponges, where brushes dried fastest. Campylobacter survived one day in all sponges and Salmonella more than seven days in two of three types of sponges. In the type of sponge that dried slowest, Salmonella grew on the first day and was always found in higher levels than in the other sponges. Non-pathogenic bacteria grew in the sponges and reached levels around 9 log CFU/sponge. In brushes all types of bacteria died over time. Campylobacter and Salmonella were reduced by more than 2.5 log to below the detection limit after one and three days, respectively. Bacteriota studies revealed a tendency for a dominance by Gram-negative bacteria and a shift to high relative prevalence of Pseudomonas over time in sponges. Both enumeration by agar plating and bacteriota analysis confirmed that the pathogens were in a minority compared to the other bacteria. Treatments of sponges and brushes with chlorine, boiling or in the dishwasher were effective to reduce Salmonella. We conclude that brushes are more hygienic than sponges and that their use should be encouraged. Contaminated sponges or brushes should be replaced or cleaned when they may have been in contact with pathogenic microorganisms, e.g. used on raw food spills. Cleaning of sponges and brushes with chlorine, boiling or dishwasher may be a safe alternative to replacing them with new ones.",

      "title": "Cross-Contamination on Atypical Surfaces and Venues in Food Service Environments.",
      "abstract": "Cross-contamination of raw food to other surfaces, hands, and foods is a serious issue in food service. With individuals eating more meals away from home, contracting a foodborne illness from a food service establishment is an increasing concern. However, most studies have concentrated on hands or food contact surfaces and neglected atypical and unusual surfaces (surfaces that are not typically identified as a source of cross-contamination) and venues. This review was conducted to identify atypically cross-contaminated surfaces and atypical venues where cross-contamination could occur that have not been examined thoroughly in the literature. Most surfaces that could be at risk for cross-contamination are frequently touched, are rarely cleaned and sanitized, and can support the persistence and/or growth of foodborne pathogens. These surfaces include menus, spice and condiment containers, aprons and coveralls, mobile devices and tablets, and money. Venues that are explored, such as temporary events, mobile vendors, and markets, are usually limited in space or infrastructure, have low compliance with proper hand washing, and provide the opportunity for raw and ready-to-eat foods to come into contact with one another. These factors create an environment in which cross-contamination can occur and potentially impact food safety. A more comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing regime encompassing these surfaces and venues could help mitigate cross-contamination. This review highlights key surfaces and venues that have the potential to be cross-contaminated and have been underestimated or not fully investigated. These knowledge gaps indicate where further work is needed to fully understand the role of these surfaces and venues in cross-contamination and how it can be prevented.",

      "abstract": "Clean eating (i.e., eating healthy foods largely from nature) has become a recent popular lifestyle trend. Orthorexia is the term used to describe a pathological preoccupation with healthy eating which causes significant impairment in one's life. The present study examined orthorexia symptoms in relation to sample characteristics, weight/shape concerns, eating behaviors, and mood in a general population sample in the United States. Participants included 217 adults who completed surveys on weight/shape concerns, eating behaviors, and mood via the data collection site, Prolific. Men had higher orthorexia symptoms than women. Across all participants, orthorexia was not related to weight/shape concerns but was related to higher weight-related restraint eating behaviors. Orthorexia was not related to stress or negative emotions; however, it was related to having higher well-being. Multiple regressions revealed how the main variables predicted orthorexia symptoms separately by gender. Routine restraint, emotional eating, stress, and well-being were significant predictors of orthorexia for men. Weight/shape concerns, routine restraint, stress, and negative emotion were significant predictors of orthorexia for women. As such, it appears that orthorexia symptomatology has both advantageous and disadvantageous associations and differentially affects men and women.",

      "title": "Ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia: Current trends and perspectives.",
      "abstract": "Mangroves in Southeast Asia provide numerous supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that are crucial to the environment and local livelihoods since they support biodiversity conservation and climate change resilience. However, Southeast Asia mangroves face deforestation threats from the expansion of commercial aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, along with climate change-related natural processes. Ecotourism has gained prominence as a financial incentive tool to support mangrove conservation and restoration. Through a systematic literature review approach, we examined the relationships between ecotourism and mangrove conservation in Southeast Asia based on scientific papers published from 2010 to 2022. Most of the studies were reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, respectively, which were associated with the highest number of vibrant mangrove ecotourism sites and largest mangrove areas compared to the other countries of Southeast Asia. Mangrove-related ecotourism activities in the above countries mainly include boat tours, bird and wildlife watching, mangrove planting, kayaking, eating seafood, and snorkeling. The economic benefits, such as an increase in income associated with mangrove ecotourism, have stimulated infrastructural development in ecotourism destinations. Local communities benefited from increased access to social amenities such as clean water, electricity, transportation networks, schools, and health services that are intended to make destinations more attractive to tourists. Economic benefits from mangrove ecotourism motivated the implementation of several community-based mangrove conservation and restoration initiatives, which attracted international financial incentives and public-private partnerships. Since mangroves are mostly located on the land occupied by indigenous people and local communities, ensuring respect for their land rights and equity in economic benefit sharing may increase their intrinsic motivation and participation in mangrove restoration and conservation initiatives. Remote sensing tools for mangrove monitoring, evaluation, and reporting, and integrated education and awareness campaigns can ensure the long-term conservation of mangroves while sustaining ecotourism's economic infrastructure and social amenities benefits.",

      "title": "Gastric acid level of humans must decrease in the future.",
      "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors strongly inhibit gastric acid production, but digestion problems do not generally arise. We can intake almost ordinary food even after total gastrectomy. Small intestine itself can digest and absorb food using various digestive enzymes without digestion in the stomach. The pH level of gastric acid in humans is much lower than that of most animals, and very close to that of carrion-eating animals called scavengers. It is assumed that ancient humans became bipedal approximately 4 million years ago. It was difficult for humans, who just started unstable bipedal locomotion, to catch quadrupedal-walking animals that can move faster, without special hunting tools. They may have eaten remaining carcasses, which is mainly the leftovers of carnivora species, as animal-derived food. The benefit to produce a volume of gastric acid for humans is carrion eating, in which disinfection by gastric acid is important. Humans produce a high concentration of gastric acid to enable consumption of a diet containing some bacteria and support this lifestyle by consuming significant energy to protect themselves from gastric acid. Now, the opportunity for strong deleterious bacteria to enter the gastrointestinal tract has decreased because of the organized clean environment. If this hygienic environment is maintained for a long time, our gastric acid level must be decreased gradually.",

      "abstract": "Recently, researchers have started investigating the influence of eating-focused social media content on viewers' body image and eating behaviour. The current systematic review collates the evidence for the relationship between exposure to eating-related social media content and people's body image, disordered eating, food consumption, and eating-related opinions. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted on five databases (i.e., Medline, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest), resulting in 38 eligible studies that examined the link between eating-related content and body image, eating behaviour and/or viewers' perceptions. Evidence showed positive relationships between exposure to certain material on social media (e.g., fast-food advertisements, clean eating, eating videos) and body image concerns, disordered eating, and consumption of, or a willingness to consume the foods seen on social media; however, studies that focused on 'healthy food' content showed no such link. Viewers expressed mixed feelings towards content such as nutrition information and mukbang videos which record hosts eating a large amount of food. Future research would benefit from a consistent measure of exposure to different eating-related content. There is also a need for more experimental research to examine the impact of watching different types of eating videos on body image, disordered eating, and food consumption.",

      "abstract": "This mixed-methods study explored the conversation around orthorexia nervosa (ON) on Instagram from a Russian-speaking perspective. Two quantitative data sources were implemented; a comparative content analysis of posts tagged with #opтopeкcия (n = 234) and #orthorexia (n = 243), and an online questionnaire completed by Russian-speakers (n = 96) sharing ON-related content on Instagram. Additionally, five questionnaire participants were interviewed, four of which identified with having (had) ON. Russian-speakers who share ON-related content on Instagram are primarily female, around their late-twenties, and prefer Instagram over other platforms. They describe people with ON as obsessed with correct eating, rather than healthy or clean eating. Instagram appears to have a dual effect; it has the potential to both trigger the onset of ON and encourage recovery. Positive content encourages a healthy relationship with food, promotes intuitive eating, and spread recovery advice. Harmful content, in turn, emphasizes specific diet and beauty ideals. Russian-speaking users mainly post pictures of food, followed by largely informative text that explains what ON is, and what recovery may look like. Their reasons for posting ON-related content are to share personal experiences, support others in recovery, and raise awareness about ON. Two main target audiences were people unaware of ON and people seeking recovery support. The relationship between ON and social media is not strictly limited to the global north. Thus, it may be valuable to further investigate non-English-speaking populations currently underrepresented in ON research.Level of evidence: Level V, descriptive study.",

      "abstract": "Firefighters are exposed to toxic chemicals not only from the fire incidents they attend, but also from their contaminated station and/or personal protective equipment (PPE). Little is currently known about firefighters' awareness, attitudes, and behaviours towards contaminants which was assessed in the UK firefighter contamination survey. Results revealed that lack of training on fire effluents and their health outcomes are strongly associated with increased fire smoke/contaminant exposure. Notably, untrained firefighters were at least twice as likely to: never clean personal protective equipment (PPE) (Crude Odds Ratio, OR 2.0, 1.5-2.7), infrequently send their PPE for professional cleaning (OR 2.0, 1.6-2.4), remain in the workwear (t-shirt etc.) worn while attending a fire incident (OR up to 3.6, 2.3-5.6), and indicate that cleaning at fire stations is not taken seriously (OR 2.4, 2.2-2.6). Firefighters personally viewing contamination as a \"badge of honour\" (BoH) were at least twice as likely to: remain in contaminated PPE after fire incidents (OR 2.3, 1.4-3.9), eat with sooty hands (OR 2.2, 1.9-2.5), notice soot in the nose/throat (OR 3.7, 2.7-5.2), and smell fire smoke on the body for more than a day after incidents (OR 2.0, 1.6-2.4). They were also more likely to indicate that cleaning at fire stations is not taken seriously (OR 2.5, 2.2-2.9) and that fire stations smell of smoke always/most of the time (OR 2.3, 2.0-2.6). Strong links were also found between belief in the BoH and never cleaning PPE (OR 1.9, 1.4-2.7), and eating while wearing contaminated PPE (OR 1.8, 1.5-2.2).",

      "title": "The Changing Global Epidemiology of Re-emerging Human Monkeypox Virus Infection: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Human monkeypox virus (MPVX) infection represents an emerging zoonotic disease caused by an orthopoxvirus, resulting in a condition reminiscent of smallpox. More recent developments have witnessed a notable surge in global MPVX outbreaks, eliciting significant concerns. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological factors of the emerging human monkeypox virus infection, including the number of suspected, confirmed, and fatal cases, as well as the risk factors for contracting monkeypox infection. We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. An electronic database search (PubMed, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct) was undertaken. For monkeypox-related studies, we included 25 peer-reviewed articles from 2018 and 2022, and data were extracted on the current evidence on the cases and the risk factors for MPVX infection, to develop public health advisories. Our reports show a rapid rise of MPVX cases in the highly endemic African regions after the 1970s, spread to other countries, and an increase in the median age from young children to young adults. The cessation of smallpox vaccination might have been one of the factors responsible for these findings. As of 2022, the genomic sequences of ten MPVX strains associated with the recent countrywide outbreak have been determined. While the West African Clade has been primarily implicated in the recent viral surge, data were insufficient to determine which mutation contributed to increased transmissibility. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), sleeping on the floor was significantly associated with contracting MPVX, while eating or processing of animal foods was not a significant risk factor. In the United States, cleaning the cages and bedding of sick animals, touching infected animals, and daily exposure to sick animals were associated with an increased probability of contracting the MPVX infection. Recent global outbreaks and the rising incidence of MPVX infections among young adults in the endemic zones might be a result of the cessation of the smallpox vaccine. The increased risk associated with exposure to sick animals or sleeping on the floor suggests high infectivity from animal excretions. Increasing awareness, strict surveillance, and contact tracing can help contain global outbreaks. The ring vaccination approach for exposed individuals is another potential disease containment strategy. Future studies should investigate measures for rapid laboratory diagnosis, maintaining lab safety, and transmissibility.",

      "abstract": "In this changing climate scenario, the availability of potable water has become scarce for both humans and animals in many parts of the world. Continuous supply of water is crucial for animals' life as well as different body and sanitary maintenance needs. Water availability has a direct and indirect role in clenching thirst, feeding, cleaning of animals and their environment, and other dairy operations. Water intake by dairy animals is affected by several factors including body weight of animals, genetic makeup, dry matter intake, mineral content of feed offered, milk productivity, environmental conditions, and water temperature. Behavioral patterns of dairy animals are adversely affected by restriction of water supply to them. Researchers have recommended that ad libitum water supply should be assured to the farm animals to avoid any negative effect on their health and performances. In the recent years, there is growing interest in quantifying the effects of restricted water supply to dairy animals. Many studies have demonstrated that the availability of potable water for animals will be a great challenge soon. Therefore, the present review paper has been formulated to gain better understanding of the factors affecting water intake in dairy animals and management strategies to ensure availability of water resources essential for their health, production, and well-being.",

      "abstract": "The possibility of nutritional supplement contamination with minute amounts of the selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) ostarine has become a major concern for athletes and result managing authorities. In case of an adverse analytical finding (AAF), affected athletes need to provide conclusive information, demonstrating that the test result originates from a contamination scenario rather than doping. The aim of this research project was to study the elimination profiles of microdosed ostarine and characterize the time-dependent urinary excretion of the drug and selected metabolites. Single- and multi-dose administration studies with 1, 10, and 50 μg of ostarine were conducted, and collected urine samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS following solid-phase extraction or enzymatic hydrolysis combined with liquid-liquid extraction. In the post-administration samples, both the maximum urine concentrations/abundance ratios and detection times of ostarine and its phase-I and phase-II metabolites were found to correlate with the administered drug dose. With regard to the observed maximum levels of ostarine, the time points of peak urinary concentrations/abundance ratios, and detection windows, a high inter-individual variation was observed. However, the study demonstrated that a single oral dose of as little as 1 μg can be detected for up to 9 (5) days by monitoring ostarine (glucuronide), and hydroxylated metabolites (especially M1a) appear to offer a considerably shorter detection window. The obtained data on ostarine (metabolite) detection times and urinary concentrations following different administration schemes support the interpretation of AAFs, in particular when scenarios of proven supplement contamination are discussed and supplement administration protocols exist.",

      "abstract": "There is limited examination about coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related food handling concerns and practices that cause chemical or microbial contamination and illness, particularly among those with food insecurity. We investigated consumer food handling concerns and practices during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether they differed by food insecurity status. An online survey was distributed among Chicago, IL, residents between 15 July and 21 August 2020 (n = 437). Independent t tests and Fisher's exact tests were used to identify differences in food handling concerns and practices between those with and without food insecurity (alpha = 0.05). Survey items included questions about food handling practices that were considered safe or neutral (i.e., washing hands and produce with water, sanitizing food packaging) and unsafe (i.e., using cleaning agents to wash foods, leaving perishable foods outside) by using 5-point Likert-style scales or categorical responses (i.e., yes, no). Participant responses fell between \"slightly\" and \"somewhat\" concerned about contracting COVID-19 from food and food packaging (mean ± standard error [SE]: 2.7 ± 0.1). Although participants reported washing their hands before eating and before preparing foods at least \"most of the time\" (mean ± SE: 4.4 ± 0.0 and 4.5 ± 0.0, respectively), only one-third engaged in unsafe practices. The majority of participants (68%) indicated that they altered food handling practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic and received information about food safety from social media (61%). When investigating differences in concerns and practices by food insecurity status, food insecure participants were more concerned about COVID-19 foodborne transmission for all food items (all P < 0.001) and more frequently performed unsafe food handling practices than those with food security (all P < 0.001). Results from this study suggest more investigation is needed to understand barriers to safe food handling knowledge and practices, particularly among those with food insecurity.",

Patients aged 18-70 years with tooth wear completed the Oral Impact on Daily Performance (OIDP) quality of life questionnaire, the NEO-FFI Personality questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ). Tooth wear was measured with the Basic Erosive Wear Examination (BEWE).Results In total, 102 subjects were recruited. Increased BEWE scores were correlated with older age and worse generic and CS-related quality of life. Increased neuroticism was correlated with increased: generic and CS OIDP scores; generic and CS eating scores; CS smiling scores; and CS carrying out major work scores. Increased GHQ scores were positively correlated with increased: generic and CS OIDP scores; generic and CS eating scores; CS speaking scores; generic and CS cleaning scores; generic relaxing scores; generic and CS smiling scores; and generic emotional state scores (p <0.05). Multivariable linear regression analyses showed that increased neuroticism and decreased GHQ both had an independent effect on generic and CS OIDP scores when adjusted for tooth wear severity (p <0.05).Conclusion Quality of life perception is complex and was not only affected by worsening levels of tooth wear.",

      "abstract": "The large-scale usage of petro-chemical-based plastics has proved to be a significant source of environmental pollution due to their non-biodegradable nature. Microbes-based enzymes such as esterases, cutinases, and lipases have shown the ability to degrade synthetic plastic. However, the degradation of plastics by enzymes is primarily limited by the unavailability of a robust enzymatic system, i.e., low activity and stability towards plastic degradation. Recently, the machine learning strategy involved structure-based and deep neural networks show desirable potential to generate functional, active stable, and tolerant polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzyme (FAST-PETase). FAST-PETase showed the highest PET hydrolytic activity among known enzymes or their variants and degraded broad ranges of plastics. The development of a closed-loop circular economy-based system of plastic degradation to monomers by FAST-PETase followed by the re-polymerization of monomers into clean plastics can be a more sustainable approach. As an alternative to synthetic plastics, diverse microbes can produce polyhydroxyalkanoates, and their degradation by microbes has been well-established. This article discusses recent updates in the enzymatic degradation of plastics for sustainable development.",

      "abstract": "Dietary trends, such as \"clean eating\" and the ketogenic diet, are popular among young adults. However, very few studies have investigated perceptions of individuals who reportedly adhere to specific popular diets, despite research indicating that people ascribe more positive attributes to individuals described as healthy eaters. Given these diets' popularity, and the potential harm that comes from following them, it seems important to understand college students' perceptions of these eating patterns. This study investigated female undergraduates' (n = 463) perceptions of vignette characters described as adhering to specific dietary practices, including three popular diets (Clean Eating, Keto, and Intermittent Fasting), the rigid healthy eating pattern, Orthorexia nervosa (ON), and a nondieting control. Characters described as adhering to Clean Eating were viewed most positively, followed by individuals following the Ketogenic diet or nondieters. Characters following an Intermittent Fasting diet, and those with ON were viewed most negatively. Findings support the idea that perceptions of individuals are associated with their adherence to specific popular diets. Future research should investigate potential links among dieting behavior and impression management.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, the population is rapidly ageing because of increasing life expectancy and decreasing birth rates. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to prepare a comprehensive overview which identifies the activities of daily living (ADLs) that are gradually reduced among patients with dementia, as well as explore the therapies applied in relation to dementia and how they effectively improve the quality of life (QoL) of patients and caregivers. Furthermore, we aim to summarise the ADL activities influenced by therapies and examine the treatment costs and care for patients so that recommendations for research and development (R&D) can be made to improve both the QoL of people with dementia and cost-saving measures. The research focuses on four selected neurodegenerative diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, vascular dementia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Therefore, the peer-reviewed English written articles from 2014 to 2019 were searched between September 1 and December 13, 2019. Twenty-seven papers were included in the analysis. The results show that essential assistance occurs in connection with activities: eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, personal hygiene, use of the toilet, and transport. By contrast, shopping or cleaning is not addressed as much. A lower ability to take care of oneself is connected with poor patient health and higher social care costs because the patient requires care from external sources, such as home aid or nurse visits. The challenge that remains is to shift new knowledge from scientific disciplines and connect it with the needs of patients to remove legitimate barriers and increase the acceptance of new solutions by popularisation. Additionally, regarding the burden on caregivers, it would be appropriate to promote this area of education and employment so that family members can use formal caregivers, ensuring them free time and much-needed rest.",

Little academic research has however examined the scope and the scale of these changes, especially in the context of foodservice provision. This mixed methods study explores the effect of Covid-19 on food consumption in English households at home and away. It reveals increased frequency and variety of cooking during lockdown as a driver of household food wastage. The study demonstrates public hesitance towards eating out post-Covid-19. Foodservice providers are expected to re-design their business settings and adopt protective and preventative measures, such as frequent cleaning and routine health checks, to encourage visitation. After the pandemic, increased preference towards consuming (more) sustainable food at home, but not when eating out, is established. These insights can aid grocery and foodservice providers in offering more tailored products and services in a post-pandemic future.",

      "title": "Comparison of imputation methods for missing production data of dairy cattle.",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, vast amounts of data representing feed intake, growth, and environmental impact of individual animals are being recorded in on-farm settings. Despite their apparent use, data collected in real-world applications often have missing values in one or several variables, due to reasons including human error, machine error, or sampling frequency misalignment across multiple variables. Since incomplete datasets are less valuable for downstream data analysis, it is important to address the missing value problem properly. One option may be to reduce the dataset to a subset that contains only complete data, but considerable data may be lost via this process. The current study aimed to compare imputation methods for the estimation of missing values in a raw dataset of dairy cattle including 454 553 records collected from 629 cows between 2009 and 2020. The dataset was subjected to a cleaning process that reduced its size to 437 075 observations corresponding to 512 cows. Missing values were present in four variables: concentrate DM intake (CDMI, missing percentage = 2.30%), forage DM intake (FDMI, 8.05%), milk yield (MY, 15.12%), and BW (64.33%). After removing all missing values, the resulting dataset (n = 129 353) was randomly sampled five times to create five independent subsets that exhibit the same missing data percentages as the cleaned dataset. Four univariate and nine multivariate imputation methods (eight machine learning methods and the MissForest method) were applied and evaluated on the five repeats, and average imputation performance was reported for each repeat. The results showed that Random Forest was overall the best imputation method for this type of data and had a lower mean squared prediction error and higher concordance correlation coefficient than the other imputation methods for all imputed variables. Random Forest performed particularly well for imputing CDMI, MY, and BW, compared to imputing FDMI.",

      "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and Schistosoma mansoni infections are common parasitic infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Their distributions vary across altitudes in Ethiopia. Hence, ongoing updates of infection risk factors and prevalence data are necessary for successful intervention. A school-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2019 involving 530 schoolchildren who were recruited by systematic random sampling from Amhara Regional State. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic, geographical and environmental factors. Stool samples were collected and processed by Ritchie's and Kato Katz techniques. Data were entered into EpiData and analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics were used to compute prevalence, and logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with STHs and S. mansoni infections. Variables with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Among 530 schoolchildren, 169 (31.9%) and 78 (14.7%) were infected with STHs and S. mansoni, respectively. The prevalence of STHs (40.2%) in the semi-highlands and S. mansoni (30.4%) in the lowlands was high. Infrequent shoes wearing, exposure to soil, not washing vegetables before eating, and living outside in lowland areas were significantly associated with STHs infections (P < 0.05). Schoolchildren who fetched water to irrigate fields, swam in rivers, and lived in lowland areas were significantly associated with S. mansoni infection (P < 0.05). In conclusion, prevalence rates of STHs and S. mansoni infections differed across altitudes in Amhara Regional State. Therefore, current control strategies including deworming and provision of clean water and education on sanitation and hygiene should be intensified and adapted to the local context.",

Dietary fibre is an important component present in whole grains and is believed to be (at least partially) responsible for these health benefits. The dietary fibre composition of whole grains is very distinct over different grains. Whole grains of cereals and pseudo-cereals are rich in both soluble and insoluble functional dietary fibre that can be largely classified as e.g., cellulose, arabinoxylan, β-glucan, xyloglucan and fructan. However, even though the health benefits associated with the consumption of dietary fibre are well known to scientists, producers and consumers, the consumption of dietary fibre and whole grains around the world is substantially lower than the recommended levels. This review will discuss the types of dietary fibre commonly found in cereals and pseudo-cereals, their nutritional significance and health benefits observed in animal and human studies.",

Alongside other cornerstones of diabetes management, dietary advice has the potential to improve glycaemic levels, reduce risk of diabetes complications and improve health-related quality of life. We have updated the 2004 recommendations for the nutritional management of diabetes to provide health professionals with evidence-based guidelines to inform discussions with patients on diabetes management, including type 2 diabetes prevention and remission. To provide this update we commissioned new systematic reviews and meta-analyses on key topics, and drew on the broader evidence available. We have strengthened and expanded on the previous recommendations to include advice relating to dietary patterns, environmental sustainability, food processing, patient support and remission of type 2 diabetes. We have used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to determine the certainty of evidence for each recommendation based on findings from the commissioned and identified systematic reviews. Our findings indicate that a range of foods and dietary patterns are suitable for diabetes management, with key recommendations for people with diabetes being largely similar for those for the general population. Important messages are to consume minimally processed plant foods, such as whole grains, vegetables, whole fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds and non-hydrogenated non-tropical vegetable oils, while minimising the consumption of red and processed meats, sodium, sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains. The updated recommendations reflect the current evidence base and, if adhered to, will improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that dietary factors may play a role in systemic low-grade chronic inflammation. Summary evidence from randomized controlled trials has shown substantial effects on biomarkers of inflammation following the adoption of plant-based diets (including, but not limited to, the Mediterranean diet), while consistent findings have been reported for higher intakes of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables and positive trends observed for the consumption of legumes, pulses, nuts, and olive oil. Among animal food groups, dairy products have been shown to have the best benefits on biomarkers of inflammation, while red meat and egg have been shown to have neutral effects. The present review provides an overview of the mechanisms underlying the relation between dietary factors and immune system, with a focus on specific macronutrient and non-nutrient phytochemicals (polyphenols) and low-grade inflammation. Substantial differences within each macronutrient group may explain the conflicting results obtained regarding foods high in saturated fats and carbohydrates, underlying the role of specific subtypes of molecules (i.e., short-chain fatty acids or fiber vs. long chain fatty acids or free added sugars) when exploring the relation between diet and inflammation, as well as the importance of the food matrix and the commixture of foods in the context of whole dietary patterns. Dietary polyphenols and oligopeptides have been hypothesized to exert several functions, including the regulation of the inflammatory response and effects on the immune system. Overall, evidence suggests that dietary factors may affect the immune system regardless of obesity-related inflammation.",

      "title": "Ideal food pyramid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis: A narrative review.",
      "abstract": "Emerging literature suggests that diet plays an important modulatory role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) because diet is an environmental factor that affects inflammation, antigen presentation, antioxidant defense mechanisms and gut microbiota. Patients with RA frequently ask their doctors about which diets to follow, and even in the absence of advice from their physicians, many patients are undertaking various dietary interventions. Given this background, the aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence to date regarding the ideal dietary approach for management of RA in order to reduce the counteracting inflammation, and to construct a food pyramid for patients with RA. The pyramid shows that carbohydrates should be consumed every day (3 portions of whole grains, preferably gluten free), together with fruits and vegetables (5 portions; among which fruit, berries and citrus fruit are to be preferred, and among the vegetables, green leafy ones.), light yogurt (125 ml), skim milk (200 ml), 1 glass (125 ml) of wine and extra virgin olive oil; weekly, fish (3 portions), white meat (3 portions), legumes (2 portions) eggs (2 portions), seasoned cheeses (2 portions), and red or processed meats (once a week). At the top of the pyramid, there are two pennants: one green means that subjects with RA need some personalized supplementation (vitamin D and omega 3) and one red means that there are some foods that are banned (salt and sugar). The food pyramid allows patients to easily figure out what to eat.",

The most common dietary sources of betaine are beets, spinach, and whole grains. Whole grains-such as quinoa, wheat and oat brans, brown rice, barley, etc.-are generally considered rich sources of betaine. This valuable compound has gained popularity as an ingredient in novel and functional foods due to the demonstrated health benefits that it may provide. This review study will provide an overview of the various natural sources of betaine, including different types of food products, and explore the potential of betaine as an innovative functional ingredient. It will thoroughly discuss its metabolic pathways and physiology, disease-preventing and health-promoting properties, and further highlight the extraction procedures and detection methods in different matrices. In addition, gaps in the existing scientific literature will be emphasized.",

      "title": "Therapeutic Benefits and Dietary Restrictions of Fiber Intake: A State of the Art Review.",
      "abstract": "Throughout history, malnutrition and deficiency diseases have been a problem for our planet's population. A balanced diet significantly influences everyone's health, and fiber intake appears to play a more important role than previously thought. The natural dietary fibers are a category of carbohydrates in the constitution of plants that are not completely digested in the human intestine. High-fiber foods, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, have consistently been highly beneficial to health and effectively reduced the risk of disease. Although the mode of action of dietary fiber in the consumer body is not fully understood, nutritionists and health professionals unanimously recognize the therapeutic benefits. This paper presents the fiber consumption in different countries, the metabolism of fiber and the range of health benefits associated with fiber intake. In addition, the influence of fiber intake on the intestinal microbiome, metabolic diseases (obesity and diabetes), neurological aspects, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer prevention are discussed. Finally, dietary restrictions and excess fiber are addressed, which can cause episodes of diarrhea and dehydration and increase the likelihood of bloating and flatulence or even bowel obstruction. However, extensive studies are needed regarding the composition and required amount of fiber in relation to the metabolism of saprotrophic microorganisms from the enteral level and the benefits of the various pathologies with which they can be correlated.",

      "title": "A Review of Healthy Dietary Choices for Cardiovascular Disease: From Individual Nutrients and Foods to Dietary Patterns.",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the first cause of mortality globally. Diet plays a fundamental role in cardiovascular health and is closely linked to the development of CVD. Numerous human studies have provided evidence on the relationship between diet and CVD. By discussing the available findings on the dietary components that potentially influence CVD progression and prevention, this review attempted to provide the current state of evidence on healthy dietary choices for CVD. We focus on the effects of individual macronutrients, whole food products, and dietary patterns on the risks of CVD, and the data from population-based trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses are summarized. Unhealthy dietary habits, such as high intake of saturated fatty acids, sugar-sweetened beverages, red meat, and processed meat as well as high salt intake are associated with the increased risk of CVD. Conversely, increased consumption of plant-based components such as dietary fiber, nuts, fruits, and vegetables is shown to be effective in reducing CVD risk factors. The Mediterranean diet appears to be one of the most evidence-based dietary patterns beneficial for CVD prevention. However, there is still great debate regarding whether the supplementation of vitamins and minerals confers cardioprotective benefits. This review provides new insights into the role of dietary factors that are harmful or protective in CVD, which can be adopted for improved cardiovascular health.",

      "title": "Optimizing Growth: The Case for Iodine.",
      "abstract": "Iodine is an essential micronutrient and component of thyroid hormone. An adequate dietary iodine intake is critical to maintain and promote normal growth and development, especially during vulnerable life stages such as pregnancy and early infancy. The role of iodine in cognitive development is supported by numerous interventional and observational studies, and when iodine intake is too low, somatic growth is also impaired. This can be clearly seen in cases of untreated congenital hypothyroidism related to severe iodine deficiency, which is characterized, in part, by a short stature. Nevertheless, the impact of a less severe iodine deficiency on growth, whether in utero or postnatal, is unclear. Robust studies examining the relationship between iodine and growth are rarely feasible, including the aspect of examining the effect of a single micronutrient on a process that is reliant on multiple nutrients for optimal success. Conversely, excessive iodine intake can affect thyroid function and the secretion of optimal thyroid hormone levels; however, whether this affects growth has not been examined. This narrative review outlines the mechanisms by which iodine contributes to the growth process from conception onwards, supported by evidence from human studies. It emphasizes the need for adequate iodine public health policies and their robust monitoring and surveillance, to ensure coverage for all population groups, particularly those at life stages vulnerable for growth. Finally, it summarizes the other micronutrients important to consider alongside iodine when seeking to assess the impact of iodine on somatic growth.",

      "title": "Milk fat: opportunities, challenges and innovation.",
      "abstract": "Milk fat is a high-value milk component that is processed mainly as butter, cheese, cream and whole milk powder. It is projected that approximately 35 million tonnes of milk fat will be produced globally by 2025. This surplus, enhances the need for diversification of milk fat products and the milk pool in general. Infant milk formula producers, for instance, have incorporated enzyme modified (\"humanised\") milk fat and fat globule phospholipids to better mimic human milk fat structures. Minor components like mono- and di-glycerides from milk fat are increasingly utilized as emulsifiers, replacing palm esters in premium-priced food products. This review examines the chemistry of milk fat and the technologies employed for its modification, fractionation and enrichment. Emerging processing technologies such as ultrasound, high pressure processing, supercritical fluid extraction and fractionation, can be employed to improve the nutritional and functional attributes of milk fat. The potential of recent developments in biological intervention, through dietary manipulation of milk fatty acid profiles in cattle also offers significant promise. Finally, this review provides evidence to help redress the imbalance in reported associations between milk fat consumption and human health, and elucidates the health benefits associated with consumption of milk fat and dairy products.",

      "abstract": "Pulses and whole grains are considered staple foods that provide a significant amount of calories, fibre and protein, making them key food sources in a nutritionally balanced diet. Additionally, pulses and whole grains contain many bioactive compounds such as dietary fibre, resistant starch, phenolic compounds and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids that are known to combat chronic disease. Notably, recent research has demonstrated that protein derived from pulse and whole grain sources contains bioactive peptides that also possess disease-fighting properties. Mechanisms of action include inhibition or alteration of enzyme activities, vasodilatation, modulation of lipid metabolism and gut microbiome and oxidative stress reduction. Consumer demand for plant-based proteins has skyrocketed primarily based on the perceived health benefits and lower carbon footprint of consuming foods from plant sources versus animal. Therefore, more research should be invested in discovering the health-promoting effects that pulse and whole grain proteins have to offer.",

      "title": "Algae as a Source of Natural Flavors in Innovative Foods.",
      "abstract": "As a result of their nutritive values, algae have been used as a food resource for centuries, and there is a growing interest to use them as enrichment ingredients in food products. However, food product acceptance by consumers is strongly linked to their organoleptic properties, especially the aroma, taste, and a combination of the two, flavor. With regard to edible algae, \"fresh seashore\", \"seafood-like\", \"cucumber green\", and \"earthy\" are descriptors commonly used to define their aromas. Several families of molecules participate in the diversity and peculiarities of algal aromas: pungent sulfur compounds and marine halogenated components but also herbaceous fatty acid derivatives and fruity-floral terpenoids. In both macroalgae (seaweeds) and microalgae, these compounds are studied from a chemistry point of view (identification and quantification) and a sensorial point of view, involving sensorial evaluation by panelists. As a whole food, a food ingredient, or a feed, algae are valued for their nutritional composition and their health benefits. However, because the acceptance of food by consumers is so strongly linked to its sensorial features, studies have been performed to explore the aromas of algae, their impact on food, their evolution through processing, and their ability to produce selected aromas using biotechnology. This review aims at highlighting algal aromas from seaweed and microalgae as well as their use, their handling, and their processing in the food industry.",

      "abstract": "Millets are recently being recognized as emerging food ingredients with multifaceted applications. Whole grain flours made from millets, exhibit diverse chemical compositions, starch digestibility and physicochemical properties. A food matrix can be viewed as a section of food microstructure, commonly coinciding with a physical spatial domain that interacts or imparts specific functionalities to a particular food constituent. The complex millet-based food matrices can help individuals to attain nutritional benefits due to the intricate and unique digestive properties of these foods. This review helps to fundamentally understand the binary and ternary interactions of millet-based foods. Nutritional bioavailability and bioaccessibility are also discussed based on additive, synergistic, masking, the antagonistic or neutralizing effect of different food matrix components on each other and the surrounding medium. The molecular basis of these interactions and their effect on important functional attributes like starch retrogradation, gelling, pasting, water, and oil holding capacity is also discussed.",

      "title": "Whole Grain Food Definition Effects on Determining Associations of Whole Grain Intake and Body Weight Changes: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Within epidemiological and intervention studies, whole grain consumption has generally shown positive associations with reductions in markers of overweight and obesity. However, studies use varied methods of determining whole grain intake, including different definitions of a whole grain food, which may explain varied results. This systematic review aimed to identify how different methods of reporting and calculating whole grain intake, including whole grain food definitions, affect reported associations between whole grain intake and body weight measures in adults. Systematic searching of PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and MEDLINE (all years to 11 June, 2020) identified eligible studies. Cohort and cross-sectional studies assessing whole grain intake and body weight measures in adults were included. Studies that did not specify methods used to calculate whole grain intake were excluded. Twenty-one cross-sectional studies (from 24 articles) and 9 prospective cohort studies (from 7 articles) were included in the review. Many cross-sectional studies showed whole grain intake was, to some degree, significantly associated with body weight measures, whereas associations varied greatly among cohort studies. Studies calculating whole grain intake using total grams of intake, USDA databases, or ≥25% whole grain in combination with listing specific foods, showed consistent beneficial effects of increasing whole grain intake on body weight. Studies with general lists of foods included as \"whole grain foods\" or lower cut-offs for whole grain content were inconsistent. The majority of studies reported whole grain intake as servings/day or grams whole grain/day. This review suggests that an association between whole grain and body weight measures remains likely, although precise associations are difficult to determine due to heterogeneity in methodologies and an inability to formally compare studies. Moving forward, application of a standardized methodology to calculate whole grain intake is essential.",

      "title": "Mycotoxin Determination and Occurrence in Pseudo-Cereals Intended for Food and Feed: A Review.",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, pseudo-cereals' consumption is increasing due to their health benefits as they possess an excellent nutrient profile. Whole pseudo-cereal grains are rich in a wide range of compounds, namely flavonoids, phenolic acids, fatty acids, and vitamins with known beneficial effects on human and animal health. Mycotoxins are common contaminants in cereals and by-products; however, the study of their natural occurrence in pseudo-cereals is currently scarce. Pseudo-cereals are similar to cereal grains; thus, mycotoxin contamination is expected to occur in pseudo-cereals. Indeed, mycotoxin-producing fungi have been reported in these matrices and, consequently, mycotoxin contents have been reported too, especially in buckwheat samples, where ochratoxin A and deoxynivalenol reached levels up to 1.79 μg/kg and 580 μg/kg, respectively. In comparison to cereal contamination, mycotoxin levels detected in pseudo-cereal samples are lower; however, more studies are necessary in order to describe the mycotoxin pattern in these samples and to establish maximum levels that ensure human and animal health protection. In this review, mycotoxin occurrence in pseudo-cereal samples as well as the main extraction methods and analytical techniques to determine them are described, showing that mycotoxins can be present in pseudo-cereal samples and that the most employed techniques for their determination are liquid and gas chromatography coupled to different detectors.",

      "abstract": "With emerging Asian-derived diet quality indices and data-driven dietary patterns available, we aimed to synthesize the various dietary patterns and quantify its association with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) among Asian populations. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for observational studies in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Dietary patterns were grouped \"high-quality,\" which included high intakes of three or more of the following food groups: 1) fruits and vegetables, 2) whole grains, 3) healthy protein sources (legumes and nuts, fish and seafood, low-fat dairy, and lean meat and poultry), and 4) liquid plant oils. High-quality patterns were further subcategorized based on their derivation methods: non-Asian indices, Asian indices, data-driven patterns, and plant-based indices. Dietary patterns were grouped \"low-quality,\" which included high intakes of two or more of the following: 5) ultraprocessed food, 6) beverages and foods with added sugars, 7) foods high in salt, and 8) alcoholic beverages. Data-driven dietary patterns characterized by animal food sources were labeled \"animal-based,\" and studies using dietary diversity scores were labeled \"diet diversity indices.\" Dietary patterns that could not be meaningfully categorized were summarized narratively. Study-specific effect estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Forty-one studies were included in this review. Higher adherence to high-quality dietary patterns in the top compared with bottom tertile defined by non-Asian indices (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.69, 0.88; GRADE: moderate), Asian indices (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90; GRADE: low), and data-driven patterns (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.89; GRADE: moderate) were associated with lower CVD risk. Plant-based, low-quality, animal-based, and diet diversity indices dietary patterns were not associated with CVD. Associations of Asian diet quality indices and CVD risk were weaker than those with non-Asian indices, highlighting the need for current Asian diet quality criteria to be updated to better capture the impact of diet on CVD. The systematic review and meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO as CRD42021244318.",

      "title": "Whole milk dairy foods and cardiometabolic health: dairy fat and beyond.",
      "abstract": "Bovine dairy milk is a nutrient-rich matrix, but consumption of full-fat dairy food varieties has been claimed historically to be associated with poorer cardiometabolic health, a notion often attributed to the saturated fat content. However, continued investigation that includes observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide evidence that favorably supports full-fat dairy foods and their bioactive components on cardiometabolic health. This review addresses this controversy by examining the evidence surrounding full-fat dairy foods and their implications for human health. Dairy foods are heterogeneous, not just in their fat content but also in other compositional aspects within and between fermented (e.g., yogurt, cheese) and nonfermented products (e.g., milk) that could differentially influence cardiometabolic health. Drawing from complementary lines of evidence from epidemiological studies and RCTs, this review describes the health effects of dairy foods regarding their fat content, as well as their polar lipids that are concentrated in the milk fat globule fraction. Observational studies have limitedly supported the consumption of full-fat dairy to protect against cardiometabolic disorders. However, this framework has been disputed by RCTs indicating that dairy foods, regardless of their fat content or fermentation, are not detrimental to cardiometabolic health and may instead alleviate certain cardiometabolic risk factors. As dietary recommendations evolve, which currently indicate to avoid full-fat dairy foods, it is essential to consider the totality of evidence, especially from RCTs, while also recognizing that investigation is needed to evaluate the complexity of dairy foods within diverse dietary patterns and their impacts on cardiometabolic health.",

      "abstract": "Cereal grains are the main dietary source of energy, carbohydrates, and plant proteins world-wide. Currently, only 41% of grains are used for human consumption, and up to 35% are used for animal feed. Cereals have been overlooked as a source of environmentally sustainable and healthy plant proteins and could play a major role in transitioning towards a more sustainable food system for healthy diets. Cereal plant proteins are of good nutritional quality, but lysine is often the limiting amino acid. When consumed as whole grains, cereals provide health-protecting components such as dietary fiber and phytochemicals. Shifting grain use from feed to traditional foods and conceptually new foods and ingredients could improve protein security and alleviate climate change. Rapid development of new grain-based food ingredients and use of grains in new food contexts, such as dairy replacements and meat analogues, could accelerate the transition. This review discusses recent developments and outlines future perspectives for cereal grain use.",

      "abstract": "Foods are not simply a delivery vehicle for nutrients; they consist of a matrix in which nutrients and non-nutrient compounds are presented that induce physiologic effects different from isolated nutrients. Dietary guidance is often based on effects of single nutrients that are considered unhealthy, such as saturated fat in beef. The purpose of this paper is to propose a working definition of the whole food beef matrix whose consumption has health effects distinct from those of isolated nutrients. The beef matrix can be defined as: the collective nutritive and non-nutritive components of the beef food structure and their unique chemical and physical interactions that may be important for human health which are distinguishable from those of the single components in isolation. Background information supporting this approach is summarized on multiple components provided by beef, temporal changes in beef consumption, dietary guidance that restricts beef, and how the background diet determines healthfulness rather than a single food. Examples of research are provided on other whole foods that differ from their constitutive nutrients and lay the groundwork for studies of beef as part of a healthy dietary pattern.",

      "abstract": "Lifestyle modifications that include adherence to healthy dietary patterns that are low in saturated fat have been associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death globally. Whole-milk dairy foods, including milk, cheese, and yogurt, are leading sources of saturated fat in the diet. Dietary guidelines around the world recommend the consumption of low-fat and fat-free dairy foods to obtain overall healthy dietary patterns that help meet nutrient recommendations while keeping within recommended calorie and saturated fat limitations. A body of observational and clinical evidence indicates, however, that whole-milk dairy food consumption, despite saturated fat content, does not increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. This review describes the proposed biological mechanisms underlying inverse associations between whole-milk dairy food consumption and risk markers for cardiometabolic health, such as altered lipid digestion, absorption, and metabolism; influence on the gut microflora; and regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. The dairy food matrix, a term used to describe how the macronutrients and micronutrients and other bioactive components of dairy foods are differentially packaged and compartmentalized among fluid milk, cheese, and yogurt, may dictate how each affects cardiovascular risk. Current evidence indicates consideration of dairy foods as complex food matrices, rather than delivery systems for isolated nutrients, such as saturated fatty acids, is warranted.",

Whole-grain-containing commercial breads and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are considered ultra-processed within NOVA, despite being considered core foods in the Australian Dietary Guidelines. These food categories contribute the greatest quantities of whole grain in the Australian diet, although consumption is less than half of the 48 g/day daily target intake. Dietitians are key to disseminating messages about nutrition and health; therefore, an accurate understanding of whole grains and the effects of processing is critical to avoid the unnecessary exclusion of nutritionally beneficial foods. The aim was to utilise an online structured questionnaire to investigate dietitians' attitudes to the promotion of grains and whole grains and understand their level of knowledge about and attitudes towards NOVA and the classification of specific whole-grain foods. Whole-grain foods were perceived positively and are regularly promoted in dietetic practice (",

      "abstract": "Starchy foods are a major energy source of the human diet, their digestion is closely related to human health. Most foods require lots of processing before eating, therefore, many factors can influence starch digestibility. The factors that affect the digestibility of starches have been widely discussed previously, but the extracted starches in those studies were different from those present within the actual food matrix. This review summarizes the factors influencing the starch digestibility in starchy foods. Endogenous non-starch components hinder the starch digestive process. Food ingredients and additives decrease starch digestibility by inhibiting the activity of digestive enzymes or hindering the contact between starch and enzymes. Storage induce the retrogradation of starch, decreasing the digestibility of foods. Therefore, preparing starchy foods with whole grains, processing them as little as possible, using food additives reasonably, and storage conditions may all be beneficial measures for the production of low GI foods.",

      "title": "Composition of Whole Grain Dietary Fiber and Phenolics and Their Impact on Markers of Inflammation.",
      "abstract": "Inflammation is an important biological response to any tissue injury. The immune system responds to any stimulus, such as irritation, damage, or infection, by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. The overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines can lead to several diseases, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, joint disorders, cancer, and allergies. Emerging science suggests that whole grains may lower the markers of inflammation. Whole grains are a significant source of dietary fiber and phenolic acids, which have an inverse association with the risk of inflammation. Both cereals and pseudo-cereals are rich in dietary fiber, e.g., arabinoxylan and β-glucan, and phenolic acids, e.g., hydroxycinnamic acids and hydroxybenzoic acids, which are predominantly present in the bran layer. However, the biological mechanisms underlying the widely reported association between whole grain consumption and a lower risk of disease are not fully understood. The modulatory effects of whole grains on inflammation are likely to be influenced by several mechanisms including the effect of dietary fiber and phenolic acids. While some of these effects are direct, others involve the gut microbiota, which transforms important bioactive substances into more beneficial metabolites that modulate the inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, the purpose of this review is twofold: first, it discusses whole grain dietary fiber and phenolic acids and highlights their potential; second, it examines the health benefits of these components and their impacts on subclinical inflammation markers, including the role of the gut microbiota. Overall, while there is promising evidence for the anti-inflammatory properties of whole grains, further research is needed to understand their effects fully.",

Often, consuming whole fruits or vegetables showed the enhanced effects than consuming the individual dietary supplement from natural products, which is widely explained by the interactive effects of co-existing phytochemicals in whole foods. Although research relevant to interactive effects among the bioactive compounds mounted up, the mechanism of interaction is still not clear. Especially, biological influence factors such as bioavailability are often neglected. The present review summarizes the progress on the synergistic and antagonistic effects of dietary phytochemicals, the evaluating models for antioxidant interactions, and the possible interaction mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo, and with an emphasis on biological-related molecular mechanisms of phytochemicals. The research on the interaction mechanism is of value for guiding how to take advantage of synergistic effects and avoid antagonistic effects in daily diets or phytochemical-based treatments for preventing chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "Wheat bran and whole wheat flour are excellent dietary fibre (DF) sources which are widely used in food industry to produce high fibre food products. Although they are successfully utilized in several cereal based food formulations, there is no report regarding their use in manti which is a traditional Turkish food consumed all over the country. This study aimed to investigate the effects of wheat bran and whole wheat flour on the nutritional and cooking quality of manti. Samples were produced in an industrial plant and evaluated in terms of DF, phytic acid, in vitro glycemic index (GI), color and cooking quality (cooking loss, cooking time, weight increase). Although an increase was observed in phytic acid contents of manti produced from wheat bran or whole wheat flour, their DF contents increased without any adverse effect on cooking quality compared to control manti produced from refined flour. Besides, whole wheat flour resulted in a significant decrease in GI. The outcomes of this study demonstrates the applicability of wheat bran and whole wheat flour for industrial-scale production of manti with a good nutritional profile.",

However, we predicted that infants would avoid processed plant foods to a lesser degree than whole leafy plants because they bear the markers of previous human engagement. In a first assessment, we presented 7- to 15-month-old infants, recruited from a predominantly White population around Berlin, Germany (",

The aim of this study was to explore the range and variety of oat and barley products in the Australian and global market within a defined range of grain food and beverage categories and examine the frequency of beta glucan health claims. Australian data were collected via a recognised nutrition audit process from the four major Australian supermarkets in metropolitan Sydney (January 2018 and September 2020) and Mintel Global New Product Database was used for global markets where a claim is permitted.

      "abstract": "The effect of diet on sleep quality has been addressed in many studies; however, whether/how plant-based diets (PBDs) impact sleep-related parameters has not been explored in detail. This review aims to give an overview of the components of PBDs and the possible mechanisms through which PBDs may improve sleep quality. Studies have indicated that diets such as PBDs, which are typically high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and fiber, are associated with better sleep outcomes, including less fragmented sleep and improved sleep duration. Several mechanisms may explain how PBDs impact and/or improve sleep outcomes. Firstly, PBDs are characteristically rich in certain nutrients, such as magnesium and vitamin B6, which have been associated with improved sleep patterns. Secondly, PBDs are often lower in saturated fats and higher in fiber, which may contribute to better overall health, including sleep quality. Additionally, plant bioactive compounds like phytochemicals and antioxidants in fruits, vegetables, and herbs may have sleep-promoting effects. According to available data, PBD and Mediterranean diet elements promise to enhance sleep quality; however, it is crucial to note that diets should be customized based on each person's needs.",

      "abstract": "The aim was to compile the evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of diet or dietary supplements used to reduce disease activity in adults with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). Searches were performed in the databases PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane. Only RCT studies of diets, foods or dietary supplements, looking at effects on the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) among adults with RA, published in peer-reviewed journals, were included. A total of 27 articles were included-three of whole diets (Mediterranean diet, raw food and anti-inflammatory diet), five of food items, five of n-3 fatty acids, five of single micronutrient supplements, four of single antioxidant supplements and five of pre-, pro- or synbiotics. Studies that showed moderate strength evidence for positive effects on disease activity in RA included interventions with a Mediterranean diet, spices (ginger powder, cinnamon powder, saffron), antioxidants (quercetin and ubiquinone), and probiotics containing Lactobacillus Casei. Other diets or supplements had either no effects or low to very low strength of evidence. In conclusion, RCT studies on diet or dietary supplements are limited in patients with RA, but based on the results in this review there is evidence that some interventions might have positive effects on DAS28.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, whole food supplementation strategies have been leveraged to target mental health. In addition, there has been increasing attention on the ability of gut microbes, so called psychobiotics, to positively impact behaviour though the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Fermented foods offer themselves as a combined whole food microbiota modulating intervention. Indeed, they contain potentially beneficial microbes, microbial metabolites and other bioactives, which are being harnessed to target the microbiota-gut-brain axis for positive benefits. This review highlights the diverse nature of fermented foods in terms of the raw materials used and type of fermentation employed, and summarises their potential to shape composition of the gut microbiota, the gut to brain communication pathways including the immune system and, ultimately, modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Throughout, we identify knowledge gaps and challenges faced in designing human studies for investigating the mental health-promoting potential of individual fermented foods or components thereof. Importantly, we also suggest solutions that can advance understanding of the therapeutic merit of fermented foods to modulate the microbiota-gut-brain axis.",

      "abstract": "Pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS) is caused by cross-reaction of a specific pollen antigen with the corresponding food allergen in sensitized individuals. The manifestations are usually limited to oral symptoms; however, sometimes, rhinitis, respiratory and skin symptoms, and anaphylactic shock may occur. In PFAS pathogenesis, when food containing protein antigens (pan-allergens) with high homology to pollen antigens is ingested, mast cells bound to pollen antigen-specific IgE distributed in the oral mucosa cross-react with the food antigen, causing a local type I allergic reaction. The prevalence of PFAS depends on the geographic conditions, such as the type and amount of pollen in the area. PFAS is prevalent in all regions owing to the wide variety of pollen antigens implicated in the disease, such as alder and grass pollen, even outside of the birch habitat area. Basic research on PFAS is expected to significantly contribute to elucidating the pathogenesis and development of therapeutic strategies for PFAS. Currently, effective treatment for patients with PFAS that allows safe consumption of raw foods is lacking, and avoiding the intake of causative foods is the basis of prevention. Furthermore, allergen immunotherapy for PFAS has not yet been established, but various attempts are underway to develop it into a novel treatment strategy. This review highlights the current research landscape on the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and clinical aspects of PFAS. We outline the research gaps that should be addressed to improve the outcomes of patients with PFAS.",

      "abstract": "Raw meat-based diets for pet nutrition are becoming increasingly popular. The percentage of meat content, composition of nutrients, and amount of additives started to play an important role in the recipe of a given food. However, the use of healthier and unprocessed food must also be balanced with the animal's specific needs based on its anatomy, physiology, and behavior. There are many potential advantages and disadvantages of a biologically appropriate raw food (BARF) diet, and all of them should be considered before switching to this approach. Raw meat is considered a diet closest to nature and least processed. However, raw diets threaten pet health because of the potential for nutrient imbalances. The choice of raw meat in pets' everyday diet should be supported by the veterinarian's medical decision and preferably also with nutritionist help. Growing animals require a specific Ca:P ratio in their diet, which may be improper in raw meat. For cats, taurine levels must be carefully checked. In addition, an imbalanced raw-meat diet can be the cause of poor semen quality in males. Females are prone to inhibition of the estrus cycle, especially due to hyperthyroidism. Exogenous thyroid hormone intake is a real concern when feeding a neck/head meat with thyroid glands. There is also a possibility of bacterial or parasitic presence in raw meat. The present paper aims to summarize the current state of knowledge about the benefits and threats of eating a raw meat diet for the health concerns of companion animals.",

The cause of infection was suspected to be improperly sterilized raw food made from domestic duck meat, which was manufactured in South Korea. All viruses isolated from cats at the shelters and from the raw food belonged to HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b. The gene constellation of all viruses was most similar to that of viruses isolated in Korea in November 2022. Of note, the viruses isolated from infected cats harbored mutations E627K or D701N in polymerase basic 2, which are indicative of adaptation to mammals. Postmortem examination revealed systemic pathologic lesions and the presence of widespread virus in different tissues. Thus, consumption of raw duck meat contaminated with HPAI virus likely caused systemic symptoms and death in cats, indicating the introduction of mammal-adapted mutations of the virus.",

In this cross-sectional study, we compared 16 non-smoking strict raw food eaters (5 women and 11 men, age 44.6 ± 12.3 years, duration of following the diet 11.6 ± 10.8 years) with the non-smoking participants (32 vegans, 27 omnivores) of the \"Risk and Benefits of a Vegan Diet\" (RBVD) study. We investigated body composition, dietary intake from 3-day weighed food records, and relevant fasting blood and serum parameters. Food choice and dietary behavior were very heterogenic in raw food eaters. They had lower mean values of BMI and percentage of body fat than the respective RBVD participants. The same holds true for energy supply and intakes of protein, carbohydrate, calcium and iodine. Serum levels revealed lower levels of HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, zinc, and vitamin D3. The raw food eaters with (",

      "abstract": "This review highlights the critical concern foreign material contamination poses across the food processing industry and provides information on methods and implementations to minimize the hazards caused by foreign materials. A foreign material is defined as any non-food, foreign bodies that may cause illness or injury to the consumer and are not typically part of the food. Foreign materials can enter the food processing plant as part of the raw materials such as fruit pits, bones, or contaminants like stones, insects, soil, grit, or pieces of harvesting equipment. Over the past 20 years, foreign materials have been responsible for about one out of ten recalls of foods, with plastic fragments being the most common complaint. The goal of this paper is to further the understanding of the risks foreign materials are to consumers and the tools that could be used to minimize the risk of foreign objects in foods.",

      "abstract": "Cooked food provides more calories to a consumer than raw food. When our human ancestors adopted cooking, the result was an increase in the caloric value of the diet. Generating the heat to cook, however, requires fuel, and accessing fuel was and remains a common problem for humanity. Cooking also frequently requires monitoring, special technology and other investments. These cooking costs should vary greatly across multiple contexts. Here I explain how to quantify this cooking trade-off as the ratio of the energetic benefits of cooking to the increased cost in handling time and examine the implications for foragers, including the first of our ancestors to cook. Ethnographic and experimental return rates and nutritional analysis about important prey items exploited by ethnohistoric Numic foragers in the North American Great Basin provide a demonstration of how the costs of cooking impact different types of prey. Foragers should make choices about which prey to capture based on expectations about the costs involved to cook them. The results indicate that the caloric benefit achieved by cooking meat is quickly lost as the cost of cooking increases, whereas many plant foods are beneficially cooked across a range of cooking costs. These findings affirm the importance of plant foods, especially geophytes, among foragers, and are highly suggestive of their importance at the onset of cooking in the human lineage.",

Using the A603 genome and genetic analysis, we show that two antibacterial mechanisms account for its vibriocidal activity -- a highly potent Type Six Secretion System (T6SS) and biosynthesis of a vibriocidal phenazine-like small molecule, named here as Ad-Phen. Further analysis indicates coregulation between Ad-Phen and a pore-forming T6SS effector TseC, which potentiates V. cholerae to killing by Ad-Phen.",

This review focuses on bio-based technologies for enhancing the decontamination of raw foods during postharvest processing, preventing cross-contamination, and rapidly detecting microbial risks. The bio-based antimicrobial compositions include bio-based antimicrobial delivery systems and coatings. The antimicrobial delivery systems are developed using cell-based carriers, microbubbles, and lipid-based colloidal particles. The antimicrobial coatings are engineered by incorporating biopolymers with conventional antimicrobials or cell-based antimicrobial carriers. The bio-based sensing approaches focus on replacing antibodies with more stable and cost-effective bio-receptors, including antimicrobial peptides, bacteriophages, DNAzymes, and engineered liposomes. Together, these approaches can reduce microbial contamination risks and enhance the in-situ detection of microbes.",

      "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of wild food plants traditionally used in the gastronomy of Tuscany, an Italian region with high biological diversity and whose cultural heritage is well known. Forty-nine bibliographic sources, including five unpublished studies, were reviewed. A list of species with ecological characteristics, plant parts used, use category (food, liquor, or seasoning), methods of preparation (raw or cooked), and recipes is presented. The use of 357 taxa (3711 use reports, URs), was recorded, belonging to 215 genera and 72 botanical families. Over the total taxa, 12 are new for Tuscany, 52 seem not to be present in other Italian regions, and 54 were not detected in the consulted European ethnobotanical literature. Of these taxa, 324 (3117 URs) were used as food, while 49 (178 URs) and 81 (416 URs) were used for liquor and seasoning, respectively. Of the 17 different food recipes, cooked vegetables constituted the largest group, followed by salads, omelets, snacks, and fillings. The chemical composition of the recorded food plants and the possible safety risks associated to their consumption, as well as their traditional medicinal use, are also shown. This review highlights the richness of ethnobotanical knowledge in Tuscany. Such biocultural heritage can be a \"source of inspiration\" for agriculture. As a reservoir of potential new crops, wild edible flora may contribute to the development of emerging horticultural sectors such as vertical farming and microgreens production. Moreover, the nutrient content and healthy properties of many wild food plants reported in this study has the ability to meet consumer demand for functional foods.",

      "abstract": "The focus on managing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is shifting towards prevention through lifestyle modification instead of treatments since the currently available treatment options are only capable of providing symptomatic relief marginally and result in various side effects. Numerous studies have reported that the intake of fermented foods resulted in the successful management of AD. Food fermentation is a biochemical process where the microorganisms metabolize the constituents of raw food materials, giving vastly different organoleptic properties and additional nutritional value, and improved biosafety effects in the final products. The consumption of fermented foods is associated with a wide array of nutraceutical benefits, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-apoptotic, anti-cancer, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, immunomodulatory, and hypocholesterolemic properties. Due to their promising health benefits, fermented food products have a great prospect for commercialization in the food industry. This paper reviews the memory and cognitive enhancement and neuroprotective potential of fermented food products on AD, the recently commercialized fermented food products in the health and food industries, and their limitations. The literature reviewed here demonstrates a growing demand for fermented food products as alternative therapeutic options for the prevention and management of AD.",

Thus, they are added as starter cultures to boost the final product quality of commercial fermented foods. Although these microorganisms originate from fermented foods and have a long history of consumption, the European Union recently applied the concept of Qualified presumption of Safety (QPS), which is a safety evaluation system for microorganisms used in food or feed in Europe. The QPS system is a species-level safety system and shares results with the European Novel Food System, a strain-level safety evaluation system. In the United States, microorganisms added to fermented foods are considered as food additives or Generally Recognized as Safe substance. In Korea, food microbe lists are presented at the species level. Moreover, the nation has established a strain-oriented evaluation system that applies temporary safety evaluation methods for food raw materials as well as new raw materials. However, when it comes to microorganisms isolated from traditional fermented foods and other fermented food products, there is no definition of the term \"species,\" and there is a lack of an evaluation system at the species level. Therefore, such an evaluation system for microbial species used in Korean fermented foods is necessary.",

      "abstract": "N-epsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML), as a potential glycotoxin and general marker for dietary advanced glycation end products (dAGEs), exists in raw food and is formed via various formation routes in food processing such as Maillard reaction between the reducing sugars and amino acids. Although comprehensive cause-effect proof is not available yet, current research suggests a potential risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes is associated with exogenous CML. Thus, CML is causing public health concerns regarding its dietary exposure, but there is a lack of explicit guidance for understanding if it is detrimental to human health. In this review, inconsistent results of dietary CML contributed to chronic disease are discussed, available concentrations of CML in consumed foods are evaluated, measurements for dietary CML and relevant analytic procedures are listed, and the possible mitigation strategies for protecting against CML formation are presented. Finally, the main challenges and future efforts are highlighted. Further studies are needed to extend the dietary CML database in a wide category of foods, apply new identifying methods, elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms, assess its detrimental role in human health, and propose standard guidelines for processed food.",

Raw wild pikeperch had a higher moisture and ash contents, as well as pH value, but lower fat and protein contents than farmed pikeperch. In sous-vide fillets, a higher fat and a lower protein content were noted in farmed fish. Slight differences in colour attributes between farmed and wild fish affected neither chroma nor hue in raw and sous-vide fillets. Wild and farmed fish fillets prepared using sous-vide were scored similarly in the sensory assessment. Although wild fish had a more beneficial fatty acid composition demonstrated by a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic, a higher fat concentration in farmed pikeperch resulted in obtaining similar or even higher concentration of these fatty acids in sous-vide fillets. Regardless of the origin of pikeperch it might be recommended as a valuable part of a daily diet.",

However, literature reviews focus on application of enzyme/support system in food technology remains scarce. This current systematic literature review aimed to identify, evaluate and interpret available and relevant researches addressing the type of support and immobilization techniques employed over lipases, in order to obtain products for food industry. Fourteen selected articles were used to structure the systematic review, in which the discussion was based on six main groups: (i) synthesis/enrichment of polyunsaturated fatty acids; (ii) synthesis of structured lipids; (iii) flavors and food coloring; (iv) additives, antioxidants and antimicrobials; (v) synthesis of phytosterol esters and (vi) synthesis of sugar esters. In general, the studies discussed the synthesis of the enzyme/support system and the characteristics: surface area, mass transfer resistance, activity, stability (pH and temperature), and recyclability. Each immobilization technique is applicable for a specific production, depending mainly on the sensitivity and cost of the process.",

      "abstract": "Based on the easy cultivation of microorganisms and their short cycle time, research on α-glucosidase inhibitors (α-GIs) of microbial origin is receiving extensive attention. Raw materials used in food production, such as cereals, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables, contain various bioactive components, like flavonoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids. Fermentation with specific bacterial strains enhances the nutritional value of these raw materials and enables the creation of hypoglycemic products rich in diverse active ingredients. Additionally, conventional food processing often results in significant byproduct generation, causing resource wastage and environmental issues. However, using bacterial strains to ferment these byproducts into α-GIs presents an innovative solution. This review describes the microbial-derived α-GIs that have been identified. Moreover, the production of α-GIs using industrial food raw materials and processing byproducts as a medium in fermentation is summarized. It is worth analyzing the selection of strains and raw materials, the separation and identification of key compounds, and fermentation broth research methods. Notably, the innovative ideas in this field are described as well. This review will provide theoretical guidance for the development of microbial-derived hypoglycemic foods.",

      "title": "Cross-Contamination on Atypical Surfaces and Venues in Food Service Environments.",
      "abstract": "Cross-contamination of raw food to other surfaces, hands, and foods is a serious issue in food service. With individuals eating more meals away from home, contracting a foodborne illness from a food service establishment is an increasing concern. However, most studies have concentrated on hands or food contact surfaces and neglected atypical and unusual surfaces (surfaces that are not typically identified as a source of cross-contamination) and venues. This review was conducted to identify atypically cross-contaminated surfaces and atypical venues where cross-contamination could occur that have not been examined thoroughly in the literature. Most surfaces that could be at risk for cross-contamination are frequently touched, are rarely cleaned and sanitized, and can support the persistence and/or growth of foodborne pathogens. These surfaces include menus, spice and condiment containers, aprons and coveralls, mobile devices and tablets, and money. Venues that are explored, such as temporary events, mobile vendors, and markets, are usually limited in space or infrastructure, have low compliance with proper hand washing, and provide the opportunity for raw and ready-to-eat foods to come into contact with one another. These factors create an environment in which cross-contamination can occur and potentially impact food safety. A more comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing regime encompassing these surfaces and venues could help mitigate cross-contamination. This review highlights key surfaces and venues that have the potential to be cross-contaminated and have been underestimated or not fully investigated. These knowledge gaps indicate where further work is needed to fully understand the role of these surfaces and venues in cross-contamination and how it can be prevented.",

As a result, numerous foods and beverages have been launched onto the market. Among the products with enhanced properties, vinegar and fermented beverages have a high potential for growth. Date palm fruits are a versatile raw material rich in sugars, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins, and phenolic compounds; thus, they are widely used for food production, including date juice, jelly, butter, and fermented beverages, such as wine and vinegar. Furthermore, their composition makes them suitable for the formulation of functional foods and beverages. Microbial transformations of date juice include alcoholic fermentation for producing wine as an end-product, or as a substrate for acetic fermentation. Lactic fermentation is also documented for transforming date juice and syrup. However, in terms of acetic acid bacteria, little evidence is available on the exploitation of date juice by acetic and gluconic fermentation for producing beverages. This review provides an overview of date fruit's composition, the related health benefits for human health, vinegar and date-based fermented non-alcoholic beverages obtained by acetic acid bacteria fermentation.",

      "abstract": "The sorting and processing of food raw materials is an important step in the food production process, and the quality of the sorting operation can directly or indirectly affect the quality of the product. In order to improve production efficiency and reduce damage to food raw materials, some food production enterprises currently use robots for sorting operations of food raw materials. In the process of robot grasping, some food raw materials such as fruits, vegetables and meat have a soft appearance, complex and changeable shape, and are easily damaged by the robot gripper. Therefore, higher requirements have been put forward for robot grippers, and the research and development of robot grippers that can reduce damage to food raw materials and ensure stable grasping has been a major focus. In addition, in order to grasp food raw materials with various shapes and sizes with low damage, a variety of sensors and control strategies are required. Based on this, this paper summarizes the low damage grasp principle and characteristics of electric grippers, pneumatic grippers, vacuum grippers and magnetic grippers used in automated sorting production lines of fruit, vegetable and meat products, as well as gripper design methods to reduce grasp damage. Then, a grasping control strategy based on visual sensors and tactile sensors was introduced. Finally, the challenges and potential future trends faced by food robot grippers were summarized.",

      "title": "Microbial food spoilage: impact, causative agents and control strategies.",
      "abstract": "Microbial food spoilage is a major contributor to food waste and, hence, to the negative environmental sustainability impacts of food production and processing. Globally, it is estimated that 15-20% of food is wasted, with waste, by definition, occurring after primary production and harvesting (for example, in households and food service establishments). Although the causative agents of food spoilage are diverse, many microorganisms are major contributors across different types of foods. For example, the genus Pseudomonas causes spoilage in various raw and ready-to-eat foods. Aerobic sporeformers (for example, members of the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus and Alicyclobacillus) cause spoilage across various foods and beverages, whereas anaerobic sporeformers (for example, Clostridiales) cause spoilage in a range of products that present low-oxygen environments. Fungi are also important spoilage microorganisms, including in products that are not susceptible to bacterial spoilage due to their low water activity or low pH. Strategies that can reduce spoilage include improved control of spoilage microorganisms in raw material and environmental sources as well as application of microbicidal or microbiostatic strategies (for example, to products and packaging). Emerging tools (for example, systems models and improved genomic tools) represent an opportunity for rational design of systems, processes and products that minimize microbial food spoilage.",

Furthermore, advances in the development of innovative non-thermal technologies can meet consumers' demand for high-quality, safe, nutritious, and minimally processed foods. Acoustic technology is characterized as environmentally friendly and is considered an alternative method due to its sustainability and economic efficiency. This technology provides advantages such as the intensification of processes, increasing the efficiency of processes and eliminating inefficient ones, improving product quality, maintaining the product's texture, organoleptic properties, and nutritional value, and ensuring the microbiological safety of the product. This review summarizes some important applications of acoustic technology in food processing, from monitoring the safety of raw materials and products, intensifying bioprocesses, increasing the effectiveness of the extraction of valuable food components, modifying food polymers' texture and technological properties, to developing biodegradable biopolymer-based composites and materials for food packaging, along with the advantages and challenges of this technology.",

      "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes contamination of ready-to-eat (RTE) food products and food-associated built environments (e.g., processing facilities) represents a food safety issue with major public health and business risk implications. A number of factors make L. monocytogenes control a particular challenge, including (i) its frequent presence in different environments, (ii) its propensity for establishing persistence in food-associated environments, (iii) its ability to grow under a variety of stressful conditions, and (iv) its ability to cause severe illness, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant people. Key sources of L. monocytogenes contamination of RTE foods are food-associated built environments. However, raw materials can also be an important source, particularly for products without a \"kill step\" (e.g., fresh produce, raw dairy products, cold-smoked seafood). While certain RTE foods (e.g., deli meats, soft cheeses, produce) have commonly been linked to listeriosis outbreaks, cases, and recalls, a number of factors will influence the specific public health risk a given RTE food represents, including the likelihood of contamination, ability to support L. monocytogenes growth, and consumer-related factors (including consumption by pregnant or immunocompromised individuals). Consequently, a risk-based approach presents the most appropriate strategy to minimize the public health and business impact of L. monocytogenes. Key challenges to control L. monocytogenes include (i) development and implementation of food safety systems that prevent L. monocytogenes persistence in food-associated built environments, (ii) minimizing L. monocytogenes contamination of raw material sources, (iii) implementation of effective root cause analysis procedures, (iv) minimizing L. monocytogenes growth in finished product, and (v) consumer education.",

      "abstract": "There are no comparative, empirical studies of the energetic costs of feeding in mammals. As a result, we lack physiological data to better understand the selection pressures on the mammalian feeding apparatus and the influence of variables such as food geometric and material properties. This study investigates interspecific scaling of the net energetic costs of feeding in relation to body size, jaw-adductor muscle mass and food properties in a sample of 12 non-human primate species ranging in size from 0.08 to 4.2 kg. Net energetic costs during feeding were measured by indirect calorimetry for a variety of pre-cut and whole raw foods varying in geometric and material properties. Net feeding costs were determined in two ways: by subtracting either the initial metabolic rate prior to feeding or subtracting the postprandial metabolic rate. Interspecific scaling relationships were evaluated using pGLS and OLS regression. Net feeding costs scale negatively relative to both body mass and jaw-adductor mass. Large animals incur relatively lower feeding costs indicating that small and large animals experience and solve mechanical challenges in relation to energetics in different ways. This article is part of the theme issue 'Food processing and nutritional assimilation in animals'.",

      "abstract": "Food service facilities are important sites where foodborne diseases have been reported to occur frequently. This study aims to determine the correlation between self-reported foodborne diseases and food-safety practices followed by food handlers of various food service facilities. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 1, 2022 to December 30, 2022 in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, China. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews and having the selected food handlers fill in a self-compiled questionnaire. Of the 1072 food handlers included in the study, 88 (8.2%) reported having experienced symptoms of foodborne diseases in the past 4 weeks. The following food-safety practices correlated with self-reported foodborne diseases: (1) infrequently using 3-compartment sinks to separately clean different types of raw food materials (P < 0.05, OR = 2.312); (2) infrequently removing non-edible parts of aquatic products outside a specific room for food processing (P < 0.001, OR = 3.916); (3) infrequently immediately refrigerating cold dishes prepared in advance to be consumed later (P < 0.001, OR = 4.048); (4) often store perishable foods at 8-60°C in the indoor environment after cooking and before eating (P < 0.05, OR = 2.068); (5) infrequently reheating cooked perishable food stored at 8-60°C for more than 2 h before eating (P < 0.05, OR = 1.934); and (6) often storing raw and cooked food in the same container (P < 0.001, OR = 3.818). Hence, a better supervision of food-safety practices of catering workers may reduce the frequency of foodborne-disease outbreaks in food service facilities.",

      "title": "Emerging Trends for Nonthermal Decontamination of Raw and Processed Meat: Ozonation, High-Hydrostatic Pressure and Cold Plasma.",
      "abstract": "Meat may contain natural, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms based on the origin and characteristics of its dietary matrix. Several decontamination substances are used during or after meat processing, which include chlorine, organic acids, inorganic phosphates, benzoates, propionates, bacteriocins, or oxidizers. Unfortunately, traditional decontamination methods are often problematic because of their adverse impact on the quality of the raw carcass or processed meat. The extended shelf-life of foods is a response to the pandemic trend, whereby consumers are more likely to choose durable products that can be stored for a longer period between visits to food stores. This includes changing purchasing habits from \"just in time\" products \"for now\" to \"just in case\" products, a trend that will not fade away with the end of the pandemic. To address these concerns, novel carcass-decontamination technologies, such as ozone, high-pressure processing and cold atmospheric plasma, together with active and clean label ingredients, have been investigated for their potential applications in the meat industry. Processing parameters, such as exposure time and processing intensity have been evaluated for each type of matrix to achieve the maximum reduction of spoilage microorganism counts without affecting the physicochemical, organoleptic, and functional characteristics of the meat products. Furthermore, combined impact (hurdle concept) was evaluated to enhance the understanding of decontamination efficiency without undesirable changes in the meat products. Most of these technologies are beneficial as they are cost-effective, chemical-free, eco-friendly, easy to use, and can treat foods in sealed packages, preventing the product from post-process contamination. Interestingly, their synergistic combination with other hurdle approaches can help to substitute the use of chemical food preservatives, which is an aspect that is currently quite desirable in the majority of consumers. Nonetheless, some of these techniques are difficult to store, requiring a large capital investment for their installation, while a lack of certification for industrial utilization is also problematic. In addition, most of them suffer from a lack of sufficient data regarding their mode of action for inactivating microorganisms and extending shelf-life stability, necessitating a need for further research in this area.",

Sprouting improves the nutritional profile and bioactive properties of grains, which are important for use as raw ingredients in the food industry. The aim of this review was to examine the lipid and fatty acid composition of germinated grains. The methods discussed include germination and analytical procedures for determining fat and fatty acid contents of grains. The effects of sprouting on the fat content and storage stability of grains were also assessed. Lipid levels ranged from 1.43% to 6.66% in the sprouted grains. The individual fatty acid content of grains changed depending on the germination conditions (17-37 °C, 1-9 days). Limited findings showed that sprouting grains at higher temperatures (20-25 °C) and longer times generated a healthy balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, which is beneficial to humans. Future studies are needed to determine the optimum incubation and germination periods specific to each grain to improve the omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Free fatty acids were produced more slowly and levels of oxidation products were lower in sprouted grains than in the raw ingredients when stored for a year. Additional studies are required to investigate the oxidative stability and shelf life of sprouted grains.",

      "title": "Cephalopods as Challenging and Promising Blue Foods: Structure, Taste, and Culinary Highlights and Applications.",
      "abstract": "Foods are complex systems due to their biological origin. Biological materials are soft matter hierarchically structured on all scales from molecules to tissues. The structure reflects the biological constraints of the organism and the function of the tissue. The structural properties influence the texture and hence the mouthfeel of foods prepared from the tissue, and the presence of flavour compounds is similarly determined by biological function. Cephalopods, such as squid, cuttlefish, and octopuses, are notoriously known for having challenging texture due to their muscles being muscular hydrostats with highly cross-linked collagen. Similar with other marine animals such as fish and crustaceans, cephalopods are rich in certain compounds such as free amino acids and free 5'-ribonucleotides that together elicit umami taste. Scientific investigations of culinary applications of cephalopods as foods must therefore involve mechanical studies (texture analysis), physicochemical measurements of thermodynamic properties (protein denaturation), as well as chemical analysis (taste and aroma compounds). The combination of such basic science investigations of food as a soft material along with an exploration of the gastronomic potential has been termed gastrophysics. In this review paper, we reviewed available gastrophysical studies of cephalopod structure, texture, and taste both as raw, soft material and in certain preparations.",

      "title": "Immune Reactivity to Raw and Processed Foods and Their Possible Contributions to Autoimmunity.",
      "abstract": "It is now known that diet or food is one of the environmental factors that can induce or contribute to autoimmunity. In a healthy person with a normal functioning immune system, food substances encounter no resistance and are allowed passage through the immune barriers without triggering immune reactivity. However, clinicians are becoming increasingly aware that modern food-processing methods can increase or decrease the immune reactivity of foods, including allergic reactions. Immune reactions to undigested food antigens could result in the production of IgE antibodies, which are involved in immediate immune reactivity, and in IgG and IgA antibodies, which are involved in delayed immune reactivity. Currently, measurements of these antibodies are generally only performed against antigens derived from raw foods. However, testing for food reactivity based only on raw food consumption is inaccurate because people eat both raw and cooked foods. Even home-cooked foods undergo different kinds of preparation or processing. Food processing can change the structure of raw food materials into secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures that can have different reactive properties. This can affect the body's normal oral tolerance of food, causing the immune system to mistakenly identify food as a harmful foreign substance and react to it immunologically, leading to food immune reactivity. This abnormal reaction to food molecules can lead to the production of antibodies against not just target food antigens but also the body's own tissues, which can have significant implications in autoimmunity induction due to cross-reactivity and the other mechanisms discussed here. We hope that this present review will stimulate further research on the role of modified food antigens in the induction of autoimmunity based on some or all of the key points discussed in this review.",

      "title": "Processing in the food chain: do cereals have to be processed to add value to the human diet?",
      "abstract": "Cereals and cereal products have a long history of use by humans. Recently, there have been some discussions regarding level of processing as a descriptor to define food products, including cereal-based foods. This has led to a somewhat emotional debate on food processing. Given the widespread inclusion of cereals in the diet, this review highlights the history of cereal processing as well as their consumption by humans. It provides an evidence-based discussion on their production, contribution to human nutrition, benefits and disadvantages. The present review illustrates the impact of processing on nutrients, as well as non-nutrients specifically in bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (RTEC), two cereal-based foods which are widely consumed and integral parts of food-based dietary guidelines globally. As a category, most cereals must be processed in some way to enable consumption by humans as we are not equipped to survive exclusively on raw grains. Even thousands of years ago, the processing of cereals was a common practice by humans, turning raw grains into palatable, safe and nutritious foods. Modern processes for cereal-based products are efficient in providing safe and good-quality products to satisfy population needs, as well as helping to meet consumer expectations by providing a range of foods that allows for a varied and balanced diet. Today, RTEC and bread make significant contributions to dietary energy and nutrient requirements and underpin food-based dietary guidance globally. They have been positively linked with intake of dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals, especially when consumed as whole grain.",

Co-products such as beef liver (BL) and beef heart (BH) can be combined to generate restructured pet foods rich in vitamins and nutrients. Sodium alginate and encapsulated calcium lactate (ALGIN) can improve the acceptability of meat pieces by transforming them into a singular shape. The objective of this experiment was to assess the physiochemical parameters of co-products for utilization in raw pet foods and restructured pet treats generated from BL and BH by using ALGIN as a structure-forming agent.

      "abstract": "Identifying beneficial foods in the environment, while avoiding ingesting something toxic, is a crucial task humans face on a daily basis. Here we directly examined adults' implicit and explicit safety evaluations of the same foods presented with different degrees of processing, ranging from unprocessed (raw) to processed (cut or cooked). Moreover, we investigated whether individual characteristics (e.g., Body Mass Index, food neophobia and hunger) modulated their evaluations. We hypothesized that adults would associate the processed form of a food with safety more than its unprocessed form since processing techniques, which are ubiquitously applied in different cultures, often reduce the toxicity of foods, and signal previous human intervention and intended consumption. Adults (N = 109, 43 females) performed an implicit Go/No-Go association task (GNAT) online, assessing the association between safety attributes and food images differing on their degree of processing, both unfamiliar and familiar foods were used. Then each food was explicitly evaluated. Results revealed that individual self-reported characteristics affected both implicit and explicit evaluations. Individuals with excess weight and obesity had a strong and positive implicit association between processed foods and safety attributes, but explicitly rated cooked foods as the least safe overall, this latter result was found in highly neophobic individuals as well. Yet, at the explicit level, when looking at unfamiliar foods only, processed foods were rated safer than unprocessed foods by all participants. Our results are the first evidence that directly highlights the relevance of the degree of processing in food safety evaluation and suggest that thinking of the important tasks humans face regarding food selection enriches our understanding of food behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The most common and increasing causes of death worldwide are cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Taking into account the fact that diet is a key factor, it is worth exploring this aspect of CVD prevention and therapy. The aim of this article is to assess the potential of the ketogenic diet in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The article is a comprehensive, meticulous analysis of the literature in this area, taking into account the most recent studies currently available. The ketogenic diet has been shown to have a multifaceted effect on the prevention and treatment of CVD. Among other aspects, it has a beneficial effect on the blood lipid profile, even compared to other diets. It shows strong anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective potential, which is due, among other factors, to the anti-inflammatory properties of the state of ketosis, the elimination of simple sugars, the restriction of total carbohydrates and the supply of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, ketone bodies provide \"rescue fuel\" for the diseased heart by affecting its metabolism. They also have a beneficial effect on the function of the vascular endothelium, including improving its function and inhibiting premature ageing. The ketogenic diet has a beneficial effect on blood pressure and other CVD risk factors through, among other aspects, weight loss. The evidence cited is often superior to that for standard diets, making it likely that the ketogenic diet shows advantages over other dietary models in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. There is a legitimate need for further research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Over a hundred years of study on the favourable effect of ketogenic diets in the treatment of epilepsy have contributed to a long-lasting discussion on its potential influence on other neurological diseases. A significant increase in the number of scientific studies in that field has been currently observed. The aim of this paper is a widespread, thorough analysis of the available scientific evidence in respect of the role of the ketogenic diet in the therapy of neurological diseases such as: epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and migraine. A wide range of the mechanisms of action of the ketogenic diet has been demonstrated in neurological diseases, including, among other effects, its influence on the reduction in inflammatory conditions and the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the restoration of the myelin sheath of the neurons, the formation and regeneration of mitochondria, neuronal metabolism, the provision of an alternative source of energy for neurons (ketone bodies), the reduction in glucose and insulin concentrations, the reduction in amyloid plaques, the induction of autophagy, the alleviation of microglia activation, the reduction in excessive neuronal activation, the modulation of intestinal microbiota, the expression of genes, dopamine production and the increase in glutamine conversion into GABA. The studies discussed (including randomised controlled studies), conducted in neurological patients, have stressed the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of epilepsy and have demonstrated its promising therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and migraine. A frequent advantage of the diet was demonstrated over non-ketogenic diets (in the control groups) in the therapy of neurological diseases, with simultaneous safety and feasibility when conducting the nutritional model.",

The relationship between the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk is a controversial topic. This publication aimed to present evidence on the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. The ketogenic diet does not fulfill the criteria of a healthy diet. It presents the potential for rapid short-term reduction of body mass, triglycerides level, Hb1Ac, and blood pressure. Its efficacy for weight loss and the above-mentioned metabolic changes is not significant in long-term observations. In terms of cardiovascular mortality, the low-carb pattern is more beneficial than very low-carbohydrate (including the ketogenic diet). There is still scarce evidence comparing ketogenic to the Mediterranean diet. Other safety concerns in cardiovascular patients such as adverse events related to ketosis, fat-free mass loss, or potential pharmacological interactions should be also taken into consideration in future research.",

      "title": "Vitamin D: Evidence-Based Health Benefits and Recommendations for Population Guidelines.",
      "abstract": "Vitamin D offers numerous under-recognized health benefits beyond its well-known role in musculoskeletal health. It is vital for extra-renal tissues, prenatal health, brain function, immunity, pregnancy, cancer prevention, and cardiovascular health. Existing guidelines issued by governmental and health organizations are bone-centric and largely overlook the abovementioned extra-skeletal benefits and optimal thresholds for vitamin D. In addition, they rely on randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which seldom show benefits due to high baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, moderate supplementation doses, and flawed study designs. This review emphasizes the findings from prospective cohort studies showing that higher 25(OH)D concentrations reduce the risks of major diseases and mortality, including pregnancy and birth outcomes. Serum concentrations > 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) significantly lower disease and mortality risks compared to <20 ng/mL. With 25% of the U.S. population and 60% of Central Europeans having levels <20 ng/mL, concentrations should be raised above 30 ng/mL. This is achievable through daily supplementation with 2000 IU/day (50 mcg/day) of vitamin D",

This is associated with a reduction in glucose-lowering medications. The weight loss observed after a short time period seems to be maintained with a long-term diet. Adequate support (supportive psychological counseling, enhancing positive affectivity, reinforcing mindful eating) is necessary to achieve a benefit and to assure adherence. Despite the documented decrease in HbA1, a definitive causal effect of KD remains to be proven. KD should be performed under strict medical supervision. Future research should clarify how compliance can be maximized and how ketosis can be optimally monitored.",

      "abstract": "Background: Recently, high-carbohydrate or low-carbohydrate (HC/LC) diets have gained substantial popularity, speculated to improve physical performance in athletes; however, the effects of short-term changes of the aforementioned nutritional interventions remain largely unclear. Methods: The present study investigated the impact of a three-week period of HC/low-fat (HC) diet followed by a three-week wash-out-phase and subsequent LC diet on the parameters of physical capacity assessed via cardiopulmonary exercise testing, body composition via bioimpedance analysis and blood profiles, which were assessed after each of the respective diet periods. Twenty-four physically active adults (14 females, age 25.8 ± 3.7 years, body mass index 22.1 ± 2.2 kg/m2), of which six participants served as a control group, were enrolled in the study. Results: After three weeks of each diet, VO2peak was comparable following both interventions (46.8 ± 6.7 (HC) vs. 47.2 ± 6.7 mL/kg/min (LC; p = 0.58)) while a significantly higher peak performance (251 ± 43 W (HC) vs. 240 ± 45 W (LC); (p = 0.0001), longer time to exhaustion (14.5 ± 2.4 min (HC) vs. 14.1 ± 2.4 min (LC); p = 0.002) and greater Watt/kg performance (4.1 ± 0.5 W/kg (HC) vs. 3.9 ± 0.5 W/kg (LC); p = 0.003) was demonstrated after the HC diet. In both trial arms, a significant reduction in body mass (65.2 ± 11.2 to 63.8 ± 11.8 kg (HC) vs. 64.8 ± 11.6 to 63.5 ± 11.3 kg (LC); both p < 0.0001) and fat mass (22.7% to 21.2%; (HC) vs. 22.3% to 20.6% (LC); both p < 0.0001) but not in lean body mass or skeletal muscle mass was shown when compared to baseline. Resting metabolic rate was not different within both groups (p > 0.05). Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol significantly decreased after the HC diet (97.9 ± 33.6 mg/dL at baseline to 78.2 ± 23.5 mg/dL; p = 0.02) while triglycerides significantly increased (76 ± 38 mg/dL at baseline to 104 ± 44 mg/dL; p = 0.005). Conclusion: A short-term HC and LC diet showed improvements in various performance parameters in favor of the HC diet. Some parameters of body composition significantly changed during both diets. The HC diet led to a significant reduction in total and LDL-cholesterol while triglycerides significantly increased.",

      "abstract": "As the incidence of Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCDs) increases, preventive approaches become more crucial. In this review, calorie restriction (CR) effects on human beings were evaluated, comparing the benefits and risks of different CR diets: classic CR vs. ketosis-inducing diets, including intermittent fasting (IF), classic ketogenic diet (CKD), fasting mimicking diet (FMD), very-low-calorie ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) and Spanish ketogenic Mediterranean diet (SKMD). Special emphasis on insulin resistance (IR) was placed, as it mediates metabolic syndrome (MS), a known risk factor for CNCD, and is predictive of MS diagnosis. CR is the most robust intervention known to increase lifespan and health span, with high evidence and known biochemical mechanisms. CR improves cardiometabolic risk parameters, boosts exercise insulin sensitivity response, and there may be benefits of implementing moderate CR on healthy young and middle-aged individuals. However, there is insufficient evidence to support long-term CR. CKD is effective for weight and MS management, and may have additional benefits such as prevention of muscle loss and appetite control. SKMD has extreme significance benefits for all the metabolic parameters studied. Studies show inconsistent benefits of IF compared to classic CR. More studies are required to study biochemical parameters, reinforce evidence, identify risks, and seek effective and safe nutritional CR approaches.",

For these reasons, a therapeutic approach is also complex and sometimes controversial. The inflammation state present in lipedema can be limited by controlling the glycemic peaks. Specifically, the ketogenic diet (KD) seems to have the right conditions to be effective. Herein, we reported a subject diagnosed with lipedema who, with only KD nutritional intervention, achieved a significant weight loss (-41 Kg), with a net decrease in body circumferences, and also reporting an improvement in pain, and therefore in the overall quality of life. She refused other types of intervention and kept KD for two years. This case could represent the first step to organize a KD nutritional protocol specifically applied to lipedema.",

Early postoperative infections may manifest with wound-healing issues, back pain, and fevers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality, but can be limited by metal artifacts. For cases with stable implants, surgical debridement with implant retention combined with at least 12 weeks of antibiotics is currently considered appropriate treatment. Staphylococcal infections are ideally treated with biofilm-active antibiotics. Suppressive antibiotic therapy can be considered when surgical debridement has been delayed or is incomplete, and for those who are poor surgical candidates for another surgery. Chronic infections may present insidiously with implant failure or pseudarthrosis; implant removal or revision is generally pursued. As current guidance is heavily based on the periprosthetic joint infection literature and low-level studies on spinal implant infections, further research on optimizing diagnostic and treatment approaches is needed.",

The most common type of diabetes is type 2 diabetes, which is estimated to have a prevalence of one in every ten adults living with diabetes in the United States. The risk factors for type 2 diabetes are obesity and being overweight. Therefore, the primary strategy used to manage type 2 diabetes is weight loss. Different measures, such as dietary therapies and physical training, have been used to manage type 2 diabetes through weight and glycemic control. The dietary therapies used to manage type 2 diabetes are ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets. Despite studies showing that both ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets significantly impact weight and glycemic control, the difference between the two diets has not been fully established. Therefore, this systematic review has demonstrated and compared the effectiveness of ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets on glycemic and weight control. The literature search was conducted on five electronic databases, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, from 2000 to 2022. Specified keywords related to the ketogenic diet (KD), low carbohydrates, and type 2 diabetes were used to search for relevant and original articles. The identified articles were analyzed using the eligibility criteria before they were included in the study. The eligibility criteria yielded 15 studies that were included in this systematic review. The results obtained by conducting a meta-analysis showed that low-carbohydrates had a greater reduction in the HbA1c than other diets (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.27%; 95% CI; -0.60%, 0.07%: P = 0.008, I2 = 66%). Similarly, a significant decrease in HbA1c percentage was recorded in patients that consumed KDs compared to those who consumed the control diets (SMD: -1.45%; 95% CI; -2.73%, -0.17%: P < 0.00001). The results also show that the KD significantly impacts weight loss than control diets. The results show that the KD is more effective in reducing glycated haemoglobin and body weight (BW) than a low-carbohydrate diet. Therefore, we can summarize that the KD is a more effective dietary therapy. However, there is a need to balance the weight loss and glycemic control benefits obtained from the KD with the increased cardiovascular risks for patients with type 2 diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - is a polygenic endocrine disorder caused by genetic, hormonal, and epigenetic factors. The importance of addressing PCOS lies in its prevalence, affecting approximately 10 to 13% of women, as well as the associated health conditions that can have a negative impact on women's lives, including infertility, dermatological manifestations of hyperandrogenism (such as hirsutism and acne), cardiovascular pathologies, metabolic disorders, and psychoemotional disorders. Currently, many theories of the development of this disease have been proposed, and as a consequence of methods of influencing and treating it. According to the clinical recommendations of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, modifying the patient's lifestyle forms the basis of comprehensive therapy. We have analyzed about 60 articles on various dietary approaches to the treatment of PCOS, sourced from PubMed, Nature Reviews, Oxford Academic, Clinical Nutrition, EJOG, ScienceDirect, and MDPI. The Mediterranean diet, the DASH diet, the ketogenic diet and the low-carb diet have proven themselves the best. Also, it's necessary to add vitamin D, E, folic acid, calcium, various pro- and prebiotics to a woman's diet. Currently, the use of inositol and GPP-1 is becoming a promising method of PCOS therapy. According to the results of the analysis, a positive effect of diet therapy on the anthropometric and biochemical parameters was noted. Based on the analysis, a positive effect of diet therapy on anthropometric and biochemical parameters has been observed. It is crucial to consider the individual characteristics of each patient and not rely solely on drug therapy when approaching the treatment of PCOS.",

      "abstract": "(1) Background: Recently, studies have emerged to explore the effects of concurrent training (CT) with a low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet (LCHF) on body composition and aerobic performance and observed its benefits. However, a large variance in the study design and observations is presented, which needs to be comprehensively assessed. We here thus completed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the effects of the intervention combining CT and LCHF on body composition and aerobic capacity in people with training experience as compared to that combining CT and other dietary strategies. (2) Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find literature in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Sport-discuss, and Medline. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers. (3) Result: Eight studies consisting of 170 participants were included in this work. The pooled results showed no significant effects of CT with LCHF on lean mass (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.3, ",

      "title": "Beneficial Effects of the Ketogenic Diet on Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD/MAFLD).",
      "abstract": "The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is likely to be approaching 38% of the world's population. It is predicted to become worse and is the main cause of morbidity and mortality due to hepatic pathologies. It is particularly worrying that NAFLD is increasingly diagnosed in children and is closely related, among other conditions, to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Against this background is the concern that the awareness of patients with NAFLD is low; in one study, almost 96% of adult patients with NAFLD in the USA were not aware of their disease. Thus, studies on the therapeutic tools used to treat NAFLD are extremely important. One promising treatment is a well-formulated ketogenic diet (KD). The aim of this paper is to present a review of the available publications and the current state of knowledge of the effect of the KD on NAFLD. This paper includes characteristics of the key factors (from the point of view of NAFLD regression), on which ketogenic diet exerts its effects, i.e., reduction in insulin resistance and body weight, elimination of fructose and monosaccharides, limitation of the total carbohydrate intake, anti-inflammatory ketosis state, or modulation of gut microbiome and metabolome. In the context of the evidence for the effectiveness of the KD in the regression of NAFLD, this paper also suggests the important role of taking responsibility for one's own health through increasing self-monitoring and self-education.",

KETO-ADPKD, an exploratory, randomized, controlled trial, is intended to provide clinical translation of these findings (NCT04680780). Sixty-six patients were randomized to a KDI arm (ketogenic diet [KD] or water fasting [WF]) or the control group. Both interventions induce significant ketogenesis on the basis of blood and breath acetone measurements. Ninety-five percent (KD) and 85% (WF) report the diet as feasible. KD leads to significant reductions in body fat and liver volume. Additionally, KD is associated with reduced kidney volume (not reaching statistical significance). Interestingly, the KD group exhibits improved kidney function at the end of treatment, while the control and WF groups show a progressive decline, as is typical in ADPKD. Safety-relevant events are largely mild, expected (initial flu-like symptoms associated with KD), and transient. Safety assessment is complemented by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lipid profile analyses.",

      "title": "The Effect of Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Capacity of Diet on Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Phenotype: Nutrition as Therapeutic Tool?",
      "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress are contributing factors to many non-communicable diseases. A growing body of evidence indicates that dietary nutrients can activate the immune system and may lead to the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fatty acids as macronutrients are key players for immunomodulation, with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids having the most beneficial effect, while polyphenols and carotenoids seem to be the most promising antioxidants. Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease with multifactorial etiology. Obesity is a major risk factor for psoriasis, which leads to worse clinical outcomes. Weight loss interventions and, generally, dietary regimens such as gluten-free and Mediterranean diet or supplement use may potentially improve psoriasis' natural course and response to therapy. However, data about more sophisticated nutritional patterns, such as ketogenic, very low-carb or specific macro- and micro-nutrient substitution, are scarce. This review aims to present the effect of strictly structured dietary nutrients, that are known to affect glucose/lipid metabolism and insulin responses, on chronic inflammation and immunity, and to discuss the utility of nutritional regimens as possible therapeutic tools for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.",

      "abstract": "A Mediterranean-style healthy eating pattern (MED-HEP) supports metabolic health, but the utility of including low-glycemic index (GI) foods to minimize postprandial glucose excursions remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the relative contribution of GI towards improvements in postprandial glycemia and glycemic variability after adopting a MED-HEP. We conducted a randomized, controlled dietary intervention, comparing high- versus low-GI diets in a multi-national (Italy, Sweden, and the United States) sample of adults at risk for type 2 diabetes. For 12 weeks, participants consumed either a low-GI or high-GI MED-HEP. We assessed postprandial plasma glucose and insulin responses to high- or low-GI meals, and daily glycemic variability via continuous glucose monitoring at baseline and post-intervention. One hundred sixty adults (86 females, 74 males; aged 55 ± 11 y, BMI 31 ± 3 kg/m2, mean ± SD) with ≥two metabolic syndrome traits completed the intervention. Postprandial insulin concentrations were greater after the high-GI versus the low-GI test meals at baseline (p = 0.004), but not post-intervention (p = 0.17). Postprandial glucose after the high-GI test meal increased post-intervention, being significantly higher than that after the low-GI test meal (35%, p < 0.001). Average daily glucose concentrations decreased in both groups post-intervention. Indices of 24-h glycemic variability were reduced in the low-GI group as compared to baseline and the high-GI intervention group. These findings suggest that low-GI foods may be an important feature within a MED-HEP.",

      "abstract": "Despite advances in technology, the overall management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) remains suboptimal. The idea of restricting carbohydrate intake to decrease glycemic spikes and insulin requirements has been revisited in recent years. After impressive results in the fields of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and epilepsy, low-carbohydrate (LCD) and ketogenic (KD) diets have gained renewed interest as a possible treatment option for T1DM. In this narrative review, we discuss the available data regarding LCDs and KDs in both the adult and pediatric populations. Research data is still scarce, as most studies are short-term and show considerable heterogeneity in dietary composition and patient outcomes. In general, carbohydrate restriction enhances glycemic control by reducing postprandial glucose excursions, improving time-in-range, and lowering HbA1c, with conflicting effects on other parameters such as lipid profile and body weight. Adverse effects such as hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are rarely reported, although some concerns have been raised regarding growth in children. The correct implementation of these diets requires a multidisciplinary approach by highly specialized healthcare professionals, who will address the medical, social, and psychological concerns that a restrictive diet entails. Large-scale and long-term studies are needed to provide more robust data before carbohydrate restriction can be widely applied to patients with T1DM.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of the interconnection between various factors related to both cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, chronic inflammation, and obesity are involved in the development and progression of both diseases but, strong evidence for a direct causal relationship between diabetes and cancer, is lacking. Several studies described a relationship between hyperglycemia and cancer at the cellular, tissular and organismic levels but at the same time recent Mendelian randomization studies proved a significant causal relationship only between hyperglycemia and breast cancer. On the other hand, the association between both hyperinsulinemia and obesity and several cancer types appears to be robust as demonstrated by Mendelian randomized studies. Metabolic alterations, including the Warburg effect and excessive glucose consumption by tumors, are discussed, highlighting the potential impact of dietary restrictions, such as fasting and low-carb diets, on tumor growth and inflammation. Recent data indicates that circulating branched-chain amino acids levels, may represent novel biomarkers that may contribute to both better diabetes control and early pancreatic cancer detection. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and shared risk factors between cancer and T2DM can provide valuable insights for cancer prevention, early detection, and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "The causes of male infertility can vary. Lifestyles, environmental factors, stressful conditions, and socio-economic conditions are significant factors. Diet plays a crucial role in improving a man's reproductive capacity. The appropriate diet should be diverse and ensure the intake of all the necessary nutrients to enhance sperm quality. The Mediterranean diet, which includes high amounts of vegetables and fruits rich in detoxifying and antioxidant substances, as well as polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and microelements, especially when consumed with organic foods and a lower carbohydrate regimen, are the key aspects addressed in this study. The objective of this research was to modify the diets of 50 subfertile men by providing them with a specific nutritional plan. This plan included consuming 80% organic foods, introducing whole grains and low glycemic load options, eliminating refined carbohydrates, consuming green leafy vegetables and red fruits daily, reducing or eliminating dairy products, consuming primarily grass-fed meat and wild caught seafood, eliminating saturated fats in favor of healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, and nuts. After three months of adhering to the low-carb food plan, testosterone levels significantly increased, while sperm DNA fragmentation decreased in a subgroup of individuals who reduced their carbohydrate intake by 35%.",

      "abstract": "In the pursuit of an effortless \"miracle cure\", there has been a significant increase in the proliferation of fad diets. These diets generally exclude a food group or macronutrients and may also restrict energy intake; they become popular quickly but often lack substantial scientific evidence to support their efficacy and safety. They only show short-term results rather than promoting a lifestyle change. Fad diets are nutritionally unbalanced and can be dangerous for some individuals. Most fad diets are generally restrictive in carbohydrates, high in protein, or unbalanced and have low energy intake, which can harm patients with early stages of chronic kidney damage (CKD) who need a low-protein diet with adequate energy intake. This narrative review discusses the risk of fad diet prescriptions for non-dialysis CKD patients.",

Substantial economic challenges discourage private investment in antibiotic research and development (R&D), with a decline in the number of companies and researchers working in the field. Compounding these issues, many countries (from low income to high income) face a growing crisis of antibiotic shortages and inequitable access to existing and emerging treatments. This has led to an increasing role for public and philanthropic funding in supporting antibiotic R&D via the creation of nonprofit public-private partnerships, including Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Biopharmaceutical Accelerator (CARB-X) and the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), industry support for the AMR Action Fund, and pilot schemes to evaluate and reimburse antibiotics in innovative ways. Now is the time to raise the urgency, ambition and commitments of the world's leaders to fully support the antibiotic R&D ecosystem, incentivizing all sectors to conduct public health-driven antibiotic R&D and make effective antibiotics accessible to all who need them.",

      "abstract": "Before metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), moderate weight loss and liver left lateral section (LLLS) volume reduction are desirable. Low-carb ketogenic diet-induced weight loss before MBS has been shown to have beneficial effects on the reduction in body weight (BW) and LLLS. However, the nutritional protocol of low-carb ketogenic diet may be hard to keep for prolonged periods due to the lack of sweet taste. Furthermore, transitioning to a low-carb ketogenic diet can cause people to crave foods that are restricted in the ketogenic diet, such as cookies, bread, pasta, and bagels. Therefore, many ready-to-eat low-carb ketogenic products (RLCKP) that mimic carbohydrate-rich foods despite a low-carb composition have been provided to make it easier for the patients to adopt a low-carb lifestyle. To date, there are no studies describing the dietary protocol for efficient and safe use of pre-operative RLCKP in terms of weight and LLLS volume reduction in patients with obesity scheduled for MBS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a 4-week diet using RLCKP in reducing BW and LLLS volume in patients with obesity scheduled for MBS.

      "title": "Carbohydrate restriction during lactation: A systematic review.",
      "abstract": "The quality of a mother's diet is important to ensure child growth and development and keep women healthy. This systematic review aimed to identify the outcomes of a carbohydrate-restricted diet during lactation. PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and LILACS were searched for studies published between 2012 and 2023; 16 studies were selected, all of them case reports or care series. The carbohydrate restriction described in the papers mainly was ketogenic, low-carb, low-carbohydrate and high-fat, and modified ketogenic diets. The main goal of women undertaking these diets was weight loss, with therapeutic purposes (monitored and supervised by health professionals) in only 2 cases: (1) ketogenic diet therapy for treatment of seizures in the infant and (2) to reduce symptoms of mother's gastroesophageal reflux. Most articles reported that lactating women were hospitalized, experiencing symptoms such as vomiting, muscle weakness, nausea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fatigue. However, articles did not mention poor outcomes for the infants. Most of the studies in this review were published in the past 3 years, indicating a possible increase in cases of women practicing carbohydrate restriction during lactation for weight loss caused by body dissatisfaction. In conclusion, carbohydrate restriction during lactation may be harmful to the lactating woman and contribute to the state of lactational ketoacidosis, but infant outcomes are mainly a change in feeding patterns. Thus, education on food and nutrition is necessary for this population.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is one of the most prevalent somatic comorbidities in individuals with major depressive disorder and greatly affects the course and prognosis of that disorder. The bidirectional relationship between major depressive disorder and obesity often creates a feedback cycle that challenges both patients and health-care providers. Gaps in interdisciplinary collaboration and limitations in knowledge transfer hinder the effective management of this patient population. This narrative Review synthesises current evidence from obesity and major depressive disorder research, offering a comprehensive risk stratification and monitoring framework that integrates psychological and metabolic parameters to enhance clinical decision making. We examine the latest evidence on pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions as well as lifestyle-based strategies-such as exercise, dietary modifications, and weight-loss medications-with the aim of alleviating depressive symptoms while supporting weight management and improving metabolic health. Bariatric surgery, which is a key component in obesity management, is not covered in this Review. Finally, we highlight the crucial need for an integrated, interdisciplinary treatment approach and provide practical guidance for optimising care to improve outcomes for individuals with major depressive disorder and comorbid obesity.",

      "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance continues to be a growing threat globally, specifically in health-care settings in which antimicrobial-resistant pathogens cause a substantial proportion of health-care-associated infections (HAIs). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the analysis of the data produced therein (ie, bioinformatics) represent an opportunity to enhance our capacity to address these threats. The 3rd Geneva Infection Prevention and Control Think Tank brought together experts to identify gaps, propose solutions, and set priorities for the use of NGS for HAIs and antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. The major deliverable recommendation from this meeting was a proposed framework for implementing the sequencing of HAI pathogens, specifically those harbouring antimicrobial-resistance mechanisms. The key components of the proposed framework relate to wet laboratory quality, sequence data quality, database and tool selection, bioinformatic analyses, data sharing, and NGS data integration, to support public health and actions for infection prevention and control. In this Personal View we detail and discuss the framework in the context of global implementation, specifically in low-income and middle-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Gluten-free and ketogenic bakery products are gaining momentum. This study aims to develop a better understanding of the nutritional quality of gluten-free bakery products labeled ketogenic and/or low-carb. For this reason, the products available on the global market that were labeled ketogenic and/or low-carb (n = 757) were retrieved and compared to standard gluten-free products (n = 509). Overall, nutritionally, no significant differences were found among ketogenic and/or low-carb products due the high intra-variability of each type, but they differed from standard products. Compared to standard products, all ketogenic and/or low carb, irrespective of categories, showed lower carbohydrates that derived chiefly from fibers and, to a lesser extent, from sugars. They also had higher protein contents (p < 0.05) compared to standard products. Fats was higher (p < 0.05) in ketogenic and/or low-carb baking mixes, savory biscuits, and sweet biscuits than in their standard counterparts. Saturated fats were higher (p < 0.05) in low-carb savory biscuits and breads, as well as in ketogenic sweet biscuits than in the same standard products. Overall, median values of the nutrients align with the definition of the ketogenic diet. Nevertheless, several products did not align with any of the ketogenic definitions. Therefore, consumers need to carefully read the nutritional facts and not rely on mentions such as low-cab and ketogenic to make their decision of purchase/consumption.",

      "title": "Low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets in body weight control: A recurrent plaguing issue of fad diets?",
      "abstract": "The most appropriate type of diets to maintain or lose body weight over the medium to long term has been a matter of controversy and debates for more than half a century. Both voluntarily and coercive food restriction, resulting in negative energy and macronutrient balance and hence weight loss, have not been designed to be maintained for the long term. By contrast, when a classical and traditional type of alimentation is consumed in ad lib conditions (e.g., the Mediterranean \"diet\"), it generally provides an appropriate nutritional density of essential macronutrients and micronutrients; it is hence appropriate for long-term use, and it provides several benefits for health if the compliance of the individuals is maintained over time. In this short review, we focus on four specific aspects: first, the need to agree on a clear definition of what is \"low\" versus \"high\" in terms of total carbohydrate intake and total fat intakes, both generally inversely related, in a representative individual with a certain lifestyle and a certain body morphology; second, the importance of discussing the duration over which it could be prescribed, that is, acute versus chronic conditions, focusing on the comparison between the fashion and often ephemeral low-carbohydrate diet (acute) with the well-recognized traditional Mediterranean type of alimentation (chronic), which includes lifestyle changes; third, the particular metabolic characteristics induced by the low-carbohydrate (high fat) diet, namely, the scramble up of ketone bodies production. The recent debate on ketogenic diets concern whether or not, in iso-energetic conditions, low-carbohydrate diets would significantly enhance energy expenditure. This is an issue that is more \"academic\" than practical, on the ground that the putative difference of 100-150 kcal/day or so (in the recent studies) is not negligible but within the inherent error of the methodology used to track total energy expenditure in free living conditions by the doubly labeled water technique. Fourth, the potential medical risks and shortcomings of ingesting (over the long term) low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets could exacerbate underlying renal dysfunction, consecutive to the joint combination of high-fat, high-protein diets, particularly in individuals with obesity. This particular diet promotes metabolic acidosis and renal hyperfiltration, which ultimately may contribute to a significant reduction in life expectancy in middle-age people.",

      "abstract": "The need for new antibacterial drugs to treat the increasing global prevalence of drug-resistant bacterial infections has clearly attracted global attention, with a range of existing and upcoming funding, policy, and legislative initiatives designed to revive antibacterial R&D. It is essential to assess whether these programs are having any real-world impact and this review continues our systematic analyses that began in 2011. Direct-acting antibacterials (47), non-traditional small molecule antibacterials (5), and β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (10) under clinical development as of December 2022 are described, as are the three antibacterial drugs launched since 2020. Encouragingly, the increased number of early-stage clinical candidates observed in the 2019 review increased in 2022, although the number of first-time drug approvals from 2020 to 2022 was disappointingly low. It will be critical to monitor how many Phase-I and -II candidates move into Phase-III and beyond in the next few years. There was also an enhanced presence of novel antibacterial pharmacophores in early-stage trials, and at least 18 of the 26 phase-I candidates were targeted to treat Gram-negative bacteria infections. Despite the promising early-stage antibacterial pipeline, it is essential to maintain funding for antibacterial R&D and to ensure that plans to address late-stage pipeline issues succeed.",

      "title": "Expanding antibiotic, vaccine, and diagnostics development and access to tackle antimicrobial resistance.",
      "abstract": "The increasing number of bacterial infections globally that do not respond to any available antibiotics indicates a need to invest in-and ensure access to-new antibiotics, vaccines, and diagnostics. The traditional model of drug development, which depends on substantial revenues to motivate investment, is no longer economically viable without push and pull incentives. Moreover, drugs developed through these mechanisms are unlikely to be affordable for all patients in need, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. New, publicly funded models based on public-private partnerships could support investment in antibiotics and novel alternatives, and lower patients' out-of-pocket costs, making drugs more accessible. Cost reductions can be achieved with public goods, such as clinical trial networks and platform-based quality assurance, manufacturing, and product development support. Preserving antibiotic effectiveness relies on accurate and timely diagnosis; however scaling up diagnostics faces technological, economic, and behavioural challenges. New technologies appeared during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is a need for a deeper understanding of market, physician, and consumer behaviour to improve the use of diagnostics in patient management. Ensuring sustainable access to antibiotics also requires infection prevention. Vaccines offer the potential to prevent infections from drug-resistant pathogens, but funding for vaccine development has been scarce in this context. The High-Level Meeting of the UN General Assembly in 2024 offers an opportunity to rethink how research and development can be reoriented to serve disease management, prevention, patient access, and antibiotic stewardship.",

      "abstract": "Many studies, including case studies, meta-analyses, and randomized trials, have demonstrated the benefits of a low-carb diet in the management of obesity, diabetes, and pre-diabetes. Numerous studies suggest that diets low in carbohydrates are safe and can greatly enhance the management of both forms of diabetes as well as the general health of those who have the disease. When used in conjunction with effective therapy, this diet can result in weight loss, decreased prescription dosages, and in certain cases, remission from type 2 diabetes. Globally, there has been a notable surge in the prevalence of diabetes cases as a result of factors such as population growth, aging, urbanization, rising obesity rates, and declining physical activity. Diabetes can be controlled in large part by diet, and millets having low-glycemic index (GI) have become more significant as they release glucose into the bloodstream at a very slow rate. Creating a low-glycemic meal mix with locally sourced ingredients is crucial for daily diet plans. Dietary changes, particularly the addition of millet, can help prevent and manage diabetes mellitus. Eating practices have long been acknowledged for their important role in promoting health and wellness through the consumption of nutrient-dense meals. The health benefits of millet, an underappreciated food crop, are numerous and include low GI, high-fiber content, non-acid-forming potential, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and gluten-free status. Apart from staple crops like wheat and rice, millets are also very healthy and useful, and they have an immense amount of opportunity to aid in the global fight against food insecurity, which is a problem that many countries now confront. Millets are high on the list of recommended foods because of their many health advantages and antioxidant characteristics. Diets that are low in carbohydrates, low in GI, Mediterranean, and very low in calories are now popular. Diabetes can be managed with a nutritious diet, regular exercise, cessation of smoking, and maintenance of a healthy body weight. Furthermore, calorie restriction, the use of low-GI meals, and an increase in fiber content are all possible nutritional strategies in the management of diabetes.",

      "abstract": "We examined the impact of exposure to sugar restrictions within 1000 days after conception on type 2 diabetes and hypertension, leveraging quasi-experimental variation from the end of the United Kingdom's sugar rationing in September 1953. Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began. In utero sugar rationing alone accounted for about one-third of the risk reduction.",

      "title": "The Role of the FODMAP Diet in IBS.",
      "abstract": "The low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyol) diet is a beneficial therapeutic approach for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, how the low FODMAP diet works is still not completely understood. These mechanisms encompass not only traditionally known factors such as luminal distension induced by gas and water but also recent evidence on the role of FOMAPs in the modulation of visceral hypersensitivity, increases in intestinal permeability, the induction of microbiota changes, and the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), as well as metabolomics and alterations in motility. Although most of the supporting evidence is of low quality, recent trials have confirmed its effectiveness, even though the majority of the evidence pertains only to the restriction phase and its effectiveness in relieving abdominal bloating and pain. This review examines potential pathophysiological mechanisms and provides an overview of the existing evidence on the effectiveness of the low FODMAP diet across various IBS subtypes. Key considerations for its use include the challenges and disadvantages associated with its practical implementation, including the need for professional guidance, variations in individual responses, concerns related to microbiota, nutritional deficiencies, the development of constipation, the necessity of excluding an eating disorder before commencing the diet, and the scarcity of long-term data. Despite its recognized efficacy in symptom management, acknowledging these limitations becomes imperative for a nuanced comprehension of the role of a low FODMAP diet in managing IBS. By investigating its potential mechanisms and evidence across IBS subtypes and addressing emerging modulations alongside limitations, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for healthcare practitioners, researchers, and patients navigating the intricate landscape of IBS.",

Neonatal hypoglycemia is a common metabolic condition that continues to plague clinicians because there is no clear relationship between low glucose concentrations or their duration that determines adverse neurologic outcomes. However, severely low, prolonged, recurrent low glucose concentrations in infants who also have marked symptoms such as seizures, flaccid hypotonia with apnea, and coma clearly are associated with permanent brain damage. Early identification of at-risk infants, early and continued breastfeeding augmented with oral dextrose gel, monitoring prefeed glucose concentrations, treating symptomatic infants who have very low and recurrent low glucose concentrations, and identifying and aggressively managing infants with persistent hyperinsulinemia and metabolic defects may help prevent neuronal injury.",

      "abstract": "This review summarizes dietary carbohydrate intolerance conditions and recent advances on the possible role of carbohydrate maldigestion and dietary outcomes in patients with functional bowel disease. When malabsorbed carbohydrates reach the colon, they are fermented by colonic bacteria, with the production of short-chain fatty acids and gas lowering colonic pH. The appearance of diarrhoea or symptoms of flatulence depends in part on the balance between the production and elimination of these fermentation products. Different studies have shown that there are no differences in the frequency of sugar malabsorption between patients with irritable bowel disease (IBS) and healthy controls; however, the severity of symptoms after a sugar challenge is higher in patients than in controls. A diet low in 'Fermentable, Oligo-Di- and Monosaccharides and Polyols' (FODMAPs) is an effective treatment for global symptoms and abdominal pain in IBS, but its implementation should be supervised by a trained dietitian. A 'bottom-up' approach to the low-FODMAP diet has been suggested to avoid an alteration of gut microbiota and nutritional status. Two approaches have been suggested in this regard: starting with only certain subgroups of the low-FODMAP diet based on dietary history or with a gluten-free diet.",

      "abstract": "Restricted sugar and ketogenic diets can alter energy balance/metabolism, but decreased energy intake may be compensated by reduced expenditure. In healthy adults, randomization to restricting free sugars or overall carbohydrates (ketogenic diet) for 12 weeks reduces fat mass without changing energy expenditure versus control. Free-sugar restriction minimally affects metabolism or gut microbiome but decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In contrast, a ketogenic diet decreases glucose tolerance, increases skeletal muscle PDK4, and reduces AMPK and GLUT4 levels. By week 4, the ketogenic diet reduces fasting glucose and increases apolipoprotein B, C-reactive protein, and postprandial glycerol concentrations. However, despite sustained ketosis, these effects are no longer apparent by week 12, when gut microbial beta diversity is altered, possibly reflective of longer-term adjustments to the ketogenic diet and/or energy balance. These data demonstrate that restricting free sugars or overall carbohydrates reduces energy intake without altering physical activity, but with divergent effects on glucose tolerance, lipoprotein profiles, and gut microbiome.",

      "abstract": "The immune and endocrine systems collectively control homeostasis in the body. The endocrine system ensures that values of essential factors and nutrients such as glucose, electrolytes and vitamins are maintained within threshold values. The immune system resolves local disruptions in tissue homeostasis, caused by pathogens or malfunctioning cells. The immediate goals of these two systems do not always align. The immune system benefits from optimal access to nutrients for itself and restriction of nutrient availability to all other organs to limit pathogen replication. The endocrine system aims to ensure optimal nutrient access for all organs, limited only by the nutrients stores that the body has available. The actual state of homeostatic parameters such as blood glucose levels represents a careful balance based on regulatory signals from the immune and endocrine systems. This state is not static but continuously adjusted in response to changes in the current metabolic needs of the body, the amount of resources it has available and the level of threats it encounters. This balance is maintained by the ability of the immune and endocrine systems to interact and co-regulate systemic metabolism. In context of metabolic disease, this system is disrupted, which impairs functionality of both systems. The failure of the endocrine system to retain levels of nutrients such as glucose within threshold values impairs functionality of the immune system. In addition, metabolic stress of organs in context of obesity is perceived by the immune system as a disruption in local homeostasis, which it tries to resolve by the excretion of factors which further disrupt normal metabolic control. In this chapter, we will discuss how the immune and endocrine systems interact under homeostatic conditions and during infection with a focus on blood glucose regulation. In addition, we will discuss how this system fails in the context of metabolic disease.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes can potentially be prevented by targeted lifestyle and weight loss interventions. Time restricted eating (TRE) is a form of intermittent fasting that has emerged as a novel diet strategy to reduce body weight and improve glycaemic control. TRE involves eating within a certain window of time (usually 4 to 10 h), and water-fasting for the remaining hours of the day. The purpose of this review is to summarize the effects of TRE on body weight and markers of glycaemic control in human subjects. We also aim to provide mechanistic insights into the effect of TRE on insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Results to date reveal that TRE produces mild weight loss (1%-4% from baseline) and energy restriction, when food consumption is restricted to 4-10 h/day. TRE also reduces fasting insulin and improves insulin sensitivity in individuals with prediabetes and those with obesity. Moreover, TRE improves glucose tolerance and decreases serum glucose excursions. The possible mechanisms underlying these benefits include increased autophagic flux, mild elevations in ketone bodies, a reduction in oxidative stress, and the stimulation of β-cell responsiveness. While these preliminary results offer promise for the use of TRE in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, larger and longer-term human trials will be needed to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. Low-FODMAP diets, which involve restricting fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols, have emerged as an effective dietary intervention for alleviating IBS symptoms. This review paper aims to synthesize current insights into the impact of a low-FODMAP diet on the gut microbiome and its mechanisms of action in managing IBS. We explore the alterations in microbial composition and function associated with a low-FODMAP diet and discuss the implications of these changes for gut health and symptom relief. Additionally, we examine the balance between symptom improvement and potential negative effects on microbial diversity and long-term gut health. Emerging evidence suggests that while a low-FODMAP diet can significantly reduce IBS symptoms, it may also lead to reductions in beneficial microbial populations. Strategies to mitigate these effects, such as the reintroduction phase and the use of probiotics, are evaluated. This review highlights the importance of a personalized approach to dietary management in IBS, considering individual variations in microbiome responses. Understanding the intricate relationship between diet, the gut microbiome, and IBS symptomatology will guide the development of more effective, sustainable dietary strategies for IBS patients.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system of genetically susceptible individuals elicits a reaction to gluten causing small intestine damage. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the resulting nutrition malabsorption can lead to anemia, bone disease, growth faltering, or other consequences. The condition is lifelong and lacks a cure; the only treatment is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet (GFD). This diet is challenging to follow and adversely influences quality of life; however, it is essential to ensure intestinal recovery and prevent future negative health consequences. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics convened an expert panel complemented by a celiac disease patient advocate to evaluate evidence for six topics, including medical nutrition therapy; the GFD; oat consumption; micronutrients; pro-/prebiotics; and the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet. This publication outlines the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Evidence Analysis Library methods used to complete the systematic review and guideline development, and summarizes the recommendations and supporting evidence. The guidelines affirm that all individuals with celiac disease should follow a GFD (1C, Imperative) that may include gluten-free oats in adults (2D, Conditional). Children should follow a nutritionally adequate GFD that supports healthy growth and development (Consensus, Imperative) and does not unnecessarily restrict gluten-free oats (Consensus, Conditional). The guidelines indicate nutritional care should include routine nutritional assessment (Consensus, Imperative) and medical nutrition therapy (Consensus, Imperative). At this time, the guidelines do not support a recommendation for the addition of the low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols diet (2C, Conditional); prebiotic or probiotic supplementation (2D, Conditional); or micronutrient supplementation (in the absence of nutritional deficiency) (Consensus, Conditional). The 2021 Celiac Disease Evidence-Based Nutrition Guideline will assist registered dietitian nutritionists in providing appropriate evidence-based medical nutrition therapy to support people with celiac disease in achieving and maintaining nutritional health and avoiding adverse celiac disease consequences throughout their lives.",

      "abstract": "Glucose homeostasis is controlled by brain-gut communications. Yet our understanding of the neuron-gut interface in the glucoregulatory system remains incomplete. Here, we find that sympathetic nerves elevate postprandial blood glucose but restrict brain glucose utilization by repressing the release of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L cells. Sympathetic nerves are in close apposition with the L cells. Importantly, sympathetic denervation or intestinal deletion of the adrenergic receptor α2 (Adra2a) augments postprandial GLP-1 secretion, leading to reduced blood glucose levels and increased brain glucose uptake. Conversely, sympathetic activation shows the opposite effects. At the cellular level, adrenergic signaling suppresses calcium flux to limit GLP-1 secretion upon sugar ingestion. Consequently, abrogation of adrenergic signal results in a significant improvement in learning and memory ability. Together, our results reveal a sympathetic nerve-enteroendocrine unit in constraining GLP-1 secretion, thus providing a therapeutic nexus of mobilizing endogenous GLP-1 for glucose management and cognitive improvement.",

      "abstract": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) and Ramadan fasting (RF) have been recently associated with several health outcomes. However, it is not yet clear if they are superior to existing treatments in terms of glucose metabolism, insulin action, and weight loss. This review aims to summarize the current data on the effects of these regimes on body weight, body composition, and glycemia. An electronic search was conducted in PUBMED and SCOPUS databases up to August 2022. Twenty-four records met the inclusion criteria and underwent a risk-of-bias assessment. The main outcomes were: (a) TRF may result in moderate weight loss in individuals with overweight/obesity; when TRF is combined with caloric restriction, weight loss is >5% of the initial body weight, (b) 14 h of fasting may be as effective as 16 h in terms of weight loss, and (c) TRF may lead to improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic responses/variability throughout the day in individuals with overweight/obesity. Concerning RF, only two studies were available and thus, conclusions were not drawn. TRF may be an effective nutritional approach for weight loss, and the amelioration of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in individuals with overweight/obesity. However, more long-term, well-designed studies are needed.",

Treatment protocols generally include dietary restriction of sugar, as well as drugs aiming at a reduction of blood glucose, mainly by activating the insulin system or supplementing insulin. This established approach does not take into account the outstanding physiological role of glucose as a key molecule in metabolism. Glucose is crucial to meet the high energy demand of the brain, which depends on it as an exclusive nutrient. Insulin independent glucose transporters GLUT1 import glucose into the brain. Reduction of blood glucose, as in current treatment concepts, may lead to energy deficiency in the brain and consecutively to worsening of - possibly already impaired - neurocognitive function. Reduced cell membrane fluidity of the vascular endothelium of the bloodbrain-barrier (BBB) - due to malnutrition and/or aging - is considered a major factor in pathogenesis of the cerebral metabolic syndrome, which is a key step in neurodegeneration. Under this aspect we suggest a novel approach to prophylaxis and treatment focusing on a sufficient supply of glucose to the brain.",

      "abstract": "A diet with low content of fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP) is established treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), with well-documented efficiency. A starch- and sucrose-reduced diet (SSRD) has shown similar promising effects. The primary aim of this randomized, non-inferiority study was to test SSRD against low FODMAP and compare the responder rates (RR = ∆Total IBS-SSS ≥ -50) to a 4-week dietary intervention of either diet. Secondary aims were to estimate responders of ≥100 score and 50% reduction; effects on extraintestinal symptoms; saturation; sugar craving; anthropometric parameters; and blood pressure. 155 IBS patients were randomized to SSRD (n = 77) or low FODMAP (n = 78) for 4 weeks, with a follow-up 5 months later without food restrictions. The questionnaires Rome IV, IBS-severity scoring system (IBS-SSS), and visual analog scale for IBS (VAS-IBS) were completed at baseline and after 2 and 4 weeks and 6 months. Weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressures were measured. Comparisons were made within the groups and between changes in the two groups. There were no differences between groups at baseline. The responder rate of SSRD was non-inferior compared with low FODMAPs at week 2 (79.2% vs. 73.1%; ",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional constipation (FC) are among the most common disorders of gut-brain interaction, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Most patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction perceive food as a trigger for their gastrointestinal symptoms, and specific dietary manipulations/advice have now been recognized as a cornerstone therapeutic option for IBS and FC. We discuss in detail the 2 most common dietary interventions used for the management of IBS-general dietary advice based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs). We summarize the literature around the possible mechanisms of FODMAP-mediated IBS pathophysiology, the current 3-step, top-down approach of administering a low FODMAP diet (LFD) (restriction phase, followed by reintroduction and personalization), the efficacy data of its restriction and personalization phases, and possible biomarkers for response to an LFD. We also summarize the limitations and challenges of an LFD along with the alternative approach to administering an LFD (e.g., bottom-up). Finally, we discuss the available efficacy data for fiber, other dietary interventions (e.g., Mediterranean diet, gluten-free diet, and holistic dietary interventions), and functional foods (e.g., kiwifruit, rhubarb, aloe, and prunes) in the management of IBS and FC.",

      "title": "Association of Systemic Immune Inflammation Index with Estimated Pulse Wave Velocity, Atherogenic Index of Plasma, Triglyceride-Glucose Index, and Cardiovascular Disease: A Large Cross-Sectional Study.",
      "abstract": "In the U.S. general population, there is a lack of understanding regarding the association between the systemic immune inflammation (SII) index and estimated pulse wave velocity (ePWV), atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index and cardiovascular disease (CVD). As a result, the objective of our research was to investigate the association between the SII index and ePWV, AIP, and TyG index and incident CVD. We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2018 to conduct this study. The correlation between the SII index and ePWV, AIP, and TyG index was examined using generalized additive models with smooth functions. In addition, the association between SII index and triglyceride (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and fast glucose (FBG) also were explored. Finally, we further performed multivariable logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline (RCS) plots, and subgroup analysis to study the connection between the SII index and CVD. Our analysis included 17389 subjects from the NHANES database. A substantial positive association existed between SII, WV, and the TyG index. In addition, with the increase of the SII index, AIP showed a trend of decreasing first, then rising, and then decreasing. The SII index was inversely and linearly associated with triglyceride (TG), while positively and linearly associated with fast glucose (FBG). However, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) had a tendency of first declining, then climbing, and finally falling with the rise in the SII index. After adjusting for potential confounders, compared with the lowest quartiles, the odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for CVD across the quartiles were 0.914 (0.777, 1.074), 0.935 (0.779, 1.096), and 1.112 (0.956, 1.293) for SII index. The RCS plot showed an inverse U-shaped curve relationship between the SII index and CVD. Overall, this study found a strong correlation between a higher SII index and ePWV and the TyG index. Additionally, these cross-sectional data also revealed a U-shaped connection between the SII index and CVD.",

      "abstract": "The apoplast comprises the intercellular space between cell membranes, includes the xylem, and extends to the rhizoplane and the outer surfaces of the plant. The apoplast plays roles in different biological processes including plant immunity. This highly specialised space is often the first place where pathogen recognition occurs, and this then triggers the immune response. The immune response in the apoplast involves different mechanisms that restrict pathogen infection. Among these responses, secretion of different molecules like proteases, proteins related to immunity, small RNAs and secondary metabolites play important and often additive or synergistic roles. In addition, production of reactive oxygen species occurs to cause direct deleterious effects on the pathogen as well as reinforce the plant's immune response by triggering modifications to cell wall composition and providing additional defence signalling capabilities. The pool of available sugar in the apoplast also plays a role in immunity. These sugars can be manipulated by both interactors, pathogens gaining access to nutrients whilst the plant's responses restrict the pathogen's access to nutrients. In this review, we describe the latest findings in the field to highlight the importance of the apoplast in plant-pathogen interactions and plant immunity. We also indicate where new discoveries are needed.",

Unlike other fasting protocols, TRE does not dictate what or how much to eat but rather focuses on the timing of meals.

However, its impact on body composition and cardiometabolic factors in healthy individuals remains unclear. Furthermore, the optimal fasting duration is still debated. Thus, we aimed to compare the effects of 8 weeks of different fasting durations on body composition and biochemical parameters in metabolically healthy, non-trained individuals using a parallel randomized controlled trial.",

      "abstract": "Whilst the treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity-related disease is managed by restricting daily energy intake, long-term adherence to dietary strategies appears unsustainable. Time-restricted eating (TRE) aims to position energy intake in an eating window under 12 h per day and offers an alternative behavioral intervention, which can aid weight management and improve cardiometabolic health. Adherence to previous TRE protocols is estimated at between 63 and 100%, although the accuracy of reporting is unclear. This study therefore aimed to provide an objective, subjective, and qualitative overview of adherence to a prescribed TRE protocol, and to identify any potential barriers affecting adherence. Adherence after 5 weeks of TRE was estimated at ~63% based on continuous glucose monitoring data when compared with time-stamped diet diaries. Subjective participant responses reported adherence at an average of ~61% per week. Barriers to adopting TRE, including work schedules, social events, and family life, were identified by participants during qualitative interviews. The findings of this study suggest that the development of personalized TRE protocols may help to navigate the barriers to adherence leading to improved health-related outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The gluten-free diet (GFD) has gained popularity beyond its main medical indication as the treatment for gluten-induced immune-mediated disorders such as celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis, gluten ataxia, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. However, the diet carries some disadvantages such as elevated costs, nutritional deficiencies, and social and psychological barriers. The present work aims to review indications, proven benefits, and adverse events of a gluten-free diet. Close follow-up with patients following the diet is recommended. More data is needed to assess the effectiveness of the diet in managing mental and cognitive disorders and to establish a connection between the brain and gluten.",

It consists of an immune-mediated enteropathy, triggered by gluten exposure in susceptible patients. All patients with CD, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, must endure a lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD). This is not an easy task due to a lack of awareness of the gluten content in foods and the extensive incorporation of gluten in processed foods. Furthermore, a GFD imposes a sense of limitation and might be associated with decreased quality of life in CD patients. This results in gluten contamination in the diet of four out of five celiac patients adhering to a GFD. Furthermore, one in three adult patients will report persistent symptoms and two in three will not achieve full histological recovery when on a GFD. In recent years, there has been extensive research conducted in the quest to find the holy grail of pharmacological treatment for CD. This review will present a concise description of the current rationale and main clinical trials related to CD drug therapy.",

Standard treatment is a strict gluten-free diet (GFD), which poses significant challenges due to dietary restrictions, cross-contamination and subsequent persistent intestinal inflammation. This underscores the need for new treatment options addressing the complex pathophysiology of CeD. Recent research focuses on developing drugs that target intestinal barrier regeneration, gluten peptide modification, immune response alteration, and gut microbial ecosystem modulation. These approaches offer potential for more effective management of CeD beyond GFD. Gluten-independent treatments may be particularly relevant under the FDA's draft guidance for CeD, which emphasizes drug development as an adjunct to GFD for patients with ongoing signs and symptoms of CeD despite strict GFD.",

Despite the established link between gluten and celiac disease (CD), where a GFD is mandatory to reach clinical and histological remission, things are more complicated when it comes to non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS) and other autoimmune/dysimmune disorders. In the last conditions, a beneficial effect of gluten withdrawal has not been properly assessed, but still is often suggested without strong supporting evidence. In this context, women have always been exposed, more than men, to higher social pressure related to nutritional behaviors and greater engagement in controlling body weight. With this narrative review, we aim to summarize current evidence on the adherence to a GFD, with particular attention to the impact on women's health.",

Therefore, for patients with CeD, adopting a GFD is not a lifestyle choice. The major problem is that a GFD is restrictive and, like all restrictive diets, it has the potential for adverse nutritional outcomes, especially if adopted for a long term. It is well known that GFD can be nutritionally inadequate and is frequently associated with vitamin and mineral deficiencies; it is also associated with excessive sugar and fat intake, particularly when gluten-free substitutes are consumed. Consequently, people with CeD are affected by higher rates of overweight and obesity and metabolic complications, such as fatty liver and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, assessment of nutritional status and diet quality at diagnosis and while on a long-term GFD is key in the management of CeD. This narrative review addresses nutritional considerations in CeD and management of common challenges associated with a GFD.",

In contrast to celiac disease, the effects of gluten on the skin and hair in the context of non-celiac gluten sensitivity are not as clear. This review aims to describe the impact of gluten on the skin and hair in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity and those without a definitive celiac disease diagnosis. A literature search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) reporting guidelines for systematic reviews. Forty-two publications met inclusion criteria with five studies describing the skin manifestations of non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Trials identifying the impact of a gluten-free diet on skin disease, as well as dermatologic conditions and their associations with antigliadin antibodies were also identified. Dermatologic manifestations in patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity vary and may be non-specific. It may be appropriate for some of these patients with skin manifestations to trial a gluten-free diet. Dermatologic conditions that may respond positively to a gluten-free diet include psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, and palmoplantar pustulosis, while linear IgA disease does not appear to improve with this dietary change.",

      "abstract": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only available treatment for celiac disease (CeD), and it may also improve symptoms in non-celiac gluten/wheat sensitivity (NCGWS). In CeD, gluten triggers an immune reaction leading to enteropathy, malabsorption, and symptoms; in NCGWS, the mechanism leading to symptoms is unknown, and neither wheat nor gluten triggers enteropathy or malabsorption. A strict GFD is, therefore, necessary for CeD, but a gluten-restricted diet (GRD) may suffice to achieve symptom control for NCGWS. Regardless of this distinction, the risk of malnutrition and macro- and micronutrient deficiencies is increased by the adoption of a GFD or GRD. Thus, patients with CeD or NCGWS should undergo nutritional assessment and subsequent monitoring, based on evidence-based tools, under the care of a multidisciplinary team involving physicians and dietitians, for the long-term management of their nutrition. This review gives an overview of available nutrition assessment tools and considerations for the nutritional management of CeD and NCGWS populations.",

      "abstract": "The popularization of the gluten-free diet brings with it a fashion for its use, which can harm the treatment of Hashimoto's disease. The few studies in this regard do not confirm positive changes resulting from a gluten-free diet. At the same time, the presence of other comorbid autoimmune diseases in this group of patients is increasing. This may have important implications for the interpretation of test results and the need for a gluten-free diet in some patients. In this review, the PubMed database was searched for links between a gluten-free diet, Hashimoto's disease, and autoimmune diseases. When analyzing the available literature, we found no basis for introducing a gluten-free diet for the standard management of Hashimoto patients. The recommended diet is instead an anti-inflammatory diet that levels the supply (to compensate for deficiencies) of vitamin D, iodine, and selenium, which are found in plant products rich in polyphenols, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids, as illustrated in this article.",

      "abstract": "Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease characterized by small intestinal villus atrophy and inflammation upon exposure to gluten. It has a global prevalence of approximately 1%. Although the gluten-free diet can be an effective treatment, this diet is burdensome with practical difficulties and frequent inadvertent gluten exposure. Moreover, there are a variety of potential complications and comorbidities of coeliac disease that might be related to malabsorption and/or chronic immune activation. Overall, individuals with coeliac disease have increased mortality compared with the general population, underscoring the severity of this common disease. Comorbidities and complications that have been associated with coeliac disease include poor growth, reproductive complications, kidney and liver diseases, respiratory disease (such as pneumonia) and infections (including sepsis). Furthermore, coeliac disease has been linked to other autoimmune disease and psychiatric disease, as well as certain cancers. Data suggest that mucosal healing on a gluten-free diet might protect against some, but not all, of these complications. In this Review, we present absolute and relative risks of coeliac-associated disorders. We discuss underlying mechanisms, the role of the gluten-free diet and mucosal healing, as well as implications for follow-up and non-dietary treatment of coeliac disease.",

      "abstract": "Coeliac disease is a systemic disorder characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, which is caused by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical presentation of coeliac disease is highly variable and ranges from malabsorption through solely extra-intestinal manifestations to asymptomatic. As a result, the majority of patients with coeliac disease remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or experience a substantial delay in diagnosis. Coeliac disease is diagnosed by a combination of serological findings of disease-related antibodies and histological evidence of villous abnormalities in duodenal biopsy samples. However, variability in histological grading and in the diagnostic performance of some commercially available serological tests remains unacceptably high and confirmatory assays are not readily available in many parts of the world. Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong, strict, gluten-free diet. However, many barriers impede patients' adherence to this diet, including lack of widespread availability, high cost, cross-contamination and its overall restrictive nature. Routine follow-up is necessary to ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet but considerable variation is evident in follow-up protocols and the optimal disease management strategy is not clear. However, these challenges in the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease suggest opportunities for future research.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the small intestine, whose only effective treatment is a gluten-free diet (GFD). It is characterized by the atrophy of the intestinal villi that leads to altered nutrient absorption. This study describes the nutritional imbalances which may be found in adults with CD following a GFD. During the first year of treatment, deficiencies will overcome as the intestinal mucosa recovers. Thus, biochemical data will show this progression, together with the decrease in symptoms. In contrast, in the long term, when a strict GFD is followed and mucosal recovery is achieved, analyzing nutrient intake makes more sense. Macronutrient consumption is characterized by its low complex carbohydrate and fiber intakes, and high fat (especially SFA) and sugar intakes. This profile has been related to the consumption of GFP and their nutritional composition, in addition to unbalanced dietary habits. The most notable deficiencies in micronutrients are usually those of iron, calcium and magnesium and vitamin D, E and some of group B. It is necessary to follow up patients with CD and to promote nutritional education among them, since it could help not only to achieve a gluten free but also a balanced diet.",

      "title": "The Gluten-Free Diet for Celiac Disease: Critical Insights to Better Understand Clinical Outcomes.",
      "abstract": "The gluten-free diet (GFD) remains a complex paradigm in managing celiac disease (CeD) in children and adults, and there are many reasons why GFD adherence should be strict to improve outcomes. However, this is a challenging task for patients, since they need to have access to quality healthcare resources that facilitate optimal GFD adherence. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the GFD, tackling coexisting nutritional deficiencies, and dealing with complex situations, such as seronegative CeD or non-responsive CeD, all require the involvement of a multidisciplinary team. The short- and long-term follow-up of CeD patients should preferably be performed by a combined Gastroenterology and Nutrition service with well-defined quality standards and the multidisciplinary involvement of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and psychologists. Nutritional advice and counseling by an experienced dietitian can reduce the costs associated with long-term follow-up of CeD patients. Likewise, psychological interventions may be essential in specific scenarios where implementing and sustaining a lifelong GFD can cause a significant psychological burden for patients. This manuscript aims to provide guidelines to improve clinical practice in the follow-up and monitoring of CeD patients and provide information on the nutritional risks of an ill-advised GFD. Clinicians, biochemists, food technologists, dietitians, and psychologists with a global view of the disease have been involved in its writing.",

Gluten seems to be a glycoprotein with a clinically relevant inflammatory effect. Several observational studies and anecdotal cases reported a correlation between gluten and various diseases, including autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. This study aimed to evaluate whether gluten-free diet could be effective in controlling inflammation and ongoing rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. We report 4 cases of patients with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis with no response to several conventional and biotechnological drugs, treated with a gluten-free diet concurrently with the drug therapy. Our patients presented different degrees of response to the diet, in terms of disease remission and improvement of symptoms. Our cases confirm that a gluten-free diet may improve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, even in patients resistant to conventional drug therapies.",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in the gastrointestinal system and its significance for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), including the significance of adopting a gluten-free and casein-free (GFCF) diet. The objective was to investigate beneficial and safety of a GFCF diet among children with a diagnosis of ASD. We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and the Cochrane Library up to January 2020 for existing systematic reviews and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were included if they investigated a GFCF diet compared to a regular diet in children aged 3 to 17 years diagnosed with ASD, with or without comorbidities. The quality of the identified existing reviews was assessed using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR). The risk of bias in RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, and overall quality of evidence was evaluated using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). We identified six relevant RCTs, which included 143 participants. The results from a random effect model showed no effect of a GFCF diet on clinician-reported autism core symptoms (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.31 (95% Cl. -0.89, 0.27)), parent-reported functional level (mean difference (MD) 0.61 (95% Cl -5.92, 7.14)) or behavioral difficulties (MD 0.80 (95% Cl -6.56, 10.16)). On the contrary, a GFCF diet might trigger gastrointestinal adverse effects (relative risk (RR) 2.33 (95% Cl 0.69, 7.90)). The quality of evidence ranged from low to very low due to serious risk of bias, serious risk of inconsistency, and serious risk of imprecision. Clinical implications of the present findings may be careful consideration of introducing a GFCF diet to children with ASD. However, the limitations of the current literature hinder the possibility of drawing any solid conclusion, and more high-quality RCTs are needed. The protocol is registered at the Danish Health Authority website.",

      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in children and adolescents. In recent years, interest in the role of diet in the treatment of FGIDs has increased. Currently, interest focuses on the low-FODMAP diet (LFD), the fructose- or lactose-restricted diet (FRD or LRD), the gluten-free diet (GFD), and the Mediterranean diet (MD). In this review, we focus on the role of these dietary patterns in the FGIDs most commonly diagnosed in clinical practice, namely irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain (FAP), functional dyspepsia (FD), and functional constipation (FC). Fifteen clinical trials were systematically reviewed (both RCTs and single-arm clinical trials). We demonstrated the lack of high-quality intervention trials. Based on current evidence, low-FODMAP diet, LRD, FRD, and GFD have no place in daily clinical practice for the management of children and adolescents with FGIDs. Nevertheless, some patients with IBS or RAP may experience some benefit from the use of a low-FODMAP diet or FRD/LRD. Limited data suggest that MD may be promising in the management of FGIDs, especially in IBS patients, but more data are required to investigate the mechanisms of its protective effects.",

      "abstract": "The gluten-free food market is growing with the increases in the number of people who adhere to gluten-free diet. The noteworthy increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet may be associated to the diagnosis of many silent and subclinical celiac disease cases, improved knowledge of celiac disease, gluten allergy or gluten sensitivity as well as to popular belief that gluten-free diet is healthier. Despite the increase in the number of people following a gluten-free diet, the lack of awareness and knowledge about gluten-free diet generates problems for non-celiac people who are considering that gluten-free products are healthier as well as for celiac people who have to follow gluten-free diet. Notwithstanding the increasing interest in adopting gluten-free diet, there are still important obstacles affecting the adherence to gluten-free diet. The limited availability, high price of products, insufficient labeling, cross-contamination risk, treatment burden, lack of knowledge and information about celiac disease and about gluten-free diet, psychological factors in celiac patients, the adverse effects of a gluten-free diet and quality defects of gluten-free products are among the major problems that faced by celiac patients. In this perspective, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of important challenges in the maintenance of a strict gluten-free diet that faced by celiac patients during the adherence to gluten-free diet and related approaches have been able for tackling the problems.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is a rising disorder and is becoming frequently diagnosed in recent years. To date, the only available treatment is the gluten-free diet (GFD). The role of gluten on components of metabolic syndrome and on related inflammatory response is still unclear due to controversial results. In recent years, scientific focus on this topic has been growing up, in particular regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters and diabetes. In addition, studies on the remaining components showed discordant results, which was likely due to heterogeneous and large celiac disease populations and to the lack of prospective studies. Furthermore, knowledge about the role of the GFD on inflammatory cytokines and the relationship among vitamin D and celiac disease, metabolic syndrome (MS) and GFD is needed. In this narrative review, we provided evidence regarding the role of the GFD on glycometabolic parameters, cholesterol, triglycerides, waist circumference, blood pressure and inflammatory cascade, also evaluating the role of vitamin D, trying to summarize whether this nutritional pattern may be a value-added for subjects with dysmetabolic conditions. Finally, due to the limited findings and very low-certainty evidence, predominantly based on observational studies, the real effects of a GFD on different components of MS, however, are unclear; nevertheless, an improvement in HDL levels has been reported, although data on glycemic levels are discordant.",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for gluten-free products around the world because certain groups of people, which have increased in the last decades, need to eliminate gluten from their diet. A growing number of people consider gluten-free products to be healthier. However, making gluten-free products such as bread is a technological challenge due to the important role of the gluten network in their development. However, other products, such as cakes and cookies usually made with wheat flour, can easily be made with gluten-free starches or flours since gluten does not play an essential role in their production. To replace wheat flour in these elaborations it is necessary to resort to gluten-free starches and/or flours and to gluten substitutes. Additionally, it can be convenient to incorporate other ingredients such as proteins, fibers, sugars or oils, as well as to modify their quantities in wheat flour formulations. Regarding gluten-free flours, it will also be necessary to know the parameters that influence their functionality in order to obtain regular products. These problems have originated a lower availability of gluten-free products which have a worse texture and are less tasty and more expensive than their homologues with gluten. These problems have been partially solved thanks to research on these types of products, their ingredients and their production methods. In recent years, studies about the nutritional improvement of these products have increased. This chapter delves into the main ingredients used in the production of gluten-free products, the processes for making gluten-free breads, cakes and cookies, and the nutritional quality of these products.",

      "abstract": "A gluten-free diet (GFD) is the treatment of choice for gluten-related disorders. It has been associated with macro- and micronutrient deficiencies. Recently, consumption of arsenic-contaminated rice has raised concern because of the potential greater risk that it may represent for people on GFDs, whose rice consumption is high, since it is a fundamental cereal in GFDs. We reviewed the data published over the last 20 years in Medline and Scielo, in English, French and Spanish, on four metals (As, Hg, Cd, and Pb), to assess whether the evidence suggests that celiac disease or consumption of a GFD is associated with increased levels of blood/urinary metal concentrations. The review revealed a few articles that were directly related to the four metals and their relationships with a GFD. The evidence supports that rice-based products are a relevant source of As and other metals. Clinical studies and evaluations based on NHANES have indicated that persons on GFDs have higher As and Hg blood/urinary levels, suggesting that the diet and not the disease is responsible for it. The levels described are statistically significant compared to those of persons on complete diets, but far from toxic levels. The question of whether higher exposure to heavy metals associated with a GFD is biologically relevant remains unanswered and deserves study.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by small intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically-predisposed individuals. A frequent extra-intestinal manifestation of CD is metabolic bone disease which contributes to an increased risk of fracture. The mechanisms underlying bone disease in CD remain incompletely understood, but multiple processes have been proposed including (1) malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism and increased skeletal resorption, (2) pro-inflammatory cytokines altering the osteoprotegerin and receptor activator of nuclear kappa-B ligand ratio favoring osteoclastogenesis, (3) hypogonadism, and (4) low weight and malnutrition. Most studies show reduced bone mineral density in patients with CD. Bone microarchitecture is also deteriorated leading to reduced whole bone stiffness. Many, but not all investigations, have shown an increased risk of fracture associated with CD. The main stay of therapy for CD is maintaining a gluten-free diet. Improvement in bone mineral density with adherence to a gluten-free diet has been well-established. Bone mineral density remains lower, however, compared to controls and increased fracture risk can persist. There is no consensus on the timing of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral density assessment in patients with CD. Routine screening for CD in patients with osteoporosis is not recommended. Little data are available on the use or efficacy of prescription osteoporosis therapeutics in patients with CD. Studies are needed to develop standardized guidelines for screening and treatment of metabolic bone disease in patients with CD to identify those who may need early intervention with prescription osteoporosis therapy.",

      "abstract": "Gluten is a mixture of storage proteins in wheat and occurs in smaller amounts in other cereal grains. It provides favorable structure to bakery products but unfortunately causes disease conditions with increasing prevalence. In the human gastrointestinal tract, gluten is cleaved into proline and gluten rich peptides that are not degraded further. These peptides trigger immune responses that might lead to celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. The main treatment option is a gluten-free diet. Alternatively, using enzymes or microorganisms with gluten-degrading properties might alleviate the disease. These components can be used during food production or could be introduced into the digestive tract as food supplements. In addition, natural food from the environment is known to enrich the microbial communities in gut and natural environmental microbial communities have high potential to degrade gluten. It remains to be investigated if food and environment-induced changes in the gut microbiome could contribute to the triggering of gluten-related diseases. KEY POINTS: • Wheat proteins, gluten, are incompletely digested in human digestive tract leading to gluten intolerance. • The only efficient treatment of gluten intolerance is life-long gluten-free diet. • Environmental bacteria acquired together with food could be source of gluten-degrading bacteria detoxifying undigested gluten peptides.",

      "abstract": "Gluten is a common dietary component with a complex protein structure. It forms incomplete products of digestion, which have the potential to mount an immune response in genetically predisposed individuals, resulting in celiac disease. It also has been linked with nonceliac gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel syndrome due to wheat allergy. A gluten-free diet is an effective treatment of these conditions; however, it can lead to micronutrient and mineral deficiencies and a macronutrient imbalance with higher sugar and lipid intake. Recent popularity has led to greater availability, but increasing cost, of commercially available gluten-free products.",

      "abstract": "The market for gluten-free products is increasing with an estimated 7.6% annual growth rate from 2020 to 2027. It has been reported that most gluten-free products, such as bread, cookies, and pasta, contain great amounts of simple carbohydrates and are low in fiber and protein, affecting people's health. Pulses such as common beans, chickpeas, lentils, and peas have been studied as an alternative for developing gluten-free products because of their high protein and fiber content. In addition, they contain bioactive compounds with nutraceutical properties, such as phenolics, saponins, dietary fiber, and resistant starch, among others. Most studies carried out with pulses in vitro and in vivo have displayed health benefits, proving that pulse-based food products are better than their counterparts, even those containing wheat, with proper sensory acceptance. This work reviews pulse's nutritional and nutraceutical properties to promote the development and consumption of gluten-free products and improve their formulations to promote people's health.",

      "abstract": "The range of gluten-free food products available to consumers is steadily expanding. In recent years, recalls of food products have highlighted the importance of accurate labeling of food products for the presence of wheat, other gluten-containing cereals, or gluten itself as refined ingredient. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into recent food recalls related to undeclared gluten/wheat contamination and consumer experiences with these recalls. Recalls of products triggered by gluten contamination are relatively scarce and are not often triggered by a consumer complaint. The impact of these recalls on consumer trust was evaluated through an online survey that was distributed among supporters of Celiac Canada (CCA) and covered (i) strategies to adhere to a gluten-free diet, (ii) experiences with gluten-free recalls and their impact on consumer trust, and (iii) demographic information. Consumer concern regarding gluten-free product recalls is significant, but the concern regarding recalls is not heightened after experiencing a recall. Companies pursuing transparency in the process, identification of the source of contamination, and mitigation strategies going forward are likely to retain consumer trust in their product and brand. Based on the survey results, further efforts focusing on consumer education regarding interpreting nutrient labels, identifying sources of information on product recalls, and understanding procedures to follow upon suspected gluten contamination of a gluten-free product are recommended.",

With an intricate pathogenesis and symptomatology, it heavily impacts the quality of life and, due to the limited efficacy of traditional pharmacological agents, patients are likely to seek other medical and non-medical solutions to their problem. Over the last few years, significant research in this domain has emphasized the importance of various psychological therapies and nutritional recommendations. Nevertheless, a correlation has been established between functional dyspepsia and food intolerances, with more and more patients adopting different kinds of exclusion diets, leading to weight loss, restrictive eating behaviour and an imbalanced nutritional state, further negatively impacting their quality of life. Thus, in this systematic review, we aimed at analysing the impact and efficiency of certain exclusion diets undertook by patients, more precisely, the gluten-free diet and the low-FODMAP diet.",

      "abstract": "A lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD) is the only treatment for celiac disease and other gluten-related disorders. Nevertheless, strict adherence to the GFD is often challenging due to concerns about social isolation, risk of gluten contaminations, high cost, poor quality and the taste of gluten-free products. Moreover, although the GFD is effective in achieving mucosal healing, it may lead to dietary imbalances due to nutrient deficiencies over a long period of time. To overcome these issues, several gluten-free wheat flours have been developed to create products that closely resemble their gluten-containing counterparts. Furthermore, given the critical importance of adhering to the GFD, it becomes essential to promote adherence and monitor possible voluntary or involuntary transgressions. Various methods, including clinical assessment, questionnaires, serology for celiac disease, duodenal biopsies and the detection of Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) are employed for this purpose, but none are considered entirely satisfactory. Since adherence to the GFD poses challenges, alternative therapies should be implemented in the coming years to improve treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients with celiac disease. The aim of this narrative review is to explore current knowledge of the GFD and investigate its future perspectives, focusing on technology advancements, follow-up strategies and insights into a rapidly changing future.",

      "abstract": "Celiac disease is a common gastroenterological illness. Current diagnostics of the disease are based on serological markers and histology of duodenal biopsies. Hitherto, a strict gluten-free diet is the only effective treatment and is necessary for good control of the disease. Serological tests in current use have very high specificity and sensitivity for diagnostics, but in follow-up they have some limitations. Their levels do not accurately reflect mucosal healing, and they are unable to detect minimal transgressions in the diet. This problem is significant in patients with IgA deficiency, and there exist no robust follow-up tools for monitoring these patients' adherence to treatment. For their follow-up, we currently use IgG-based tests, and these antibodies persist for a long time even when a patient has stopped consuming gluten. More accurate and specific biomarkers are definitely needed. Adherence to a gluten-free diet is essential not only for intestinal mucosa healing and alleviation of symptoms but also for preventing complications associated with celiac disease. Here, we summarize current evidence regarding noninvasive biomarkers potentially useful for follow-up not only of patients with IgA deficiency but for all patients with celiac disease. We describe several very promising biomarkers with potential to be part of clinical practice in the near future.",

      "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increase in demand for gluten-free (GF) products due to the growing number of gluten-intolerant and healthy individuals choosing to follow a gluten-free diet. Gluten-free bread (GFB) is a staple food product; therefore, many recent studies have reported the nutritional properties of GFB. However, an overview of the current ingredients and nutritional labeling of GFB worldwide has not yet been provided. This review aimed to gather the latest information regarding the most used ingredients in GFB formulations and the nutritional quality of these products from different countries, based on studies published in the last decade (2010-2020). Our analysis showed that GFB had a lower protein and a higher fat content than gluten-containing bread, and the dietary fiber content was highly variable between countries. Some studies have revealed a high glycaemic index in most products, which is associated with the extensive use of rice flour and starch as the main ingredients in GFB formulation. Label information presented significant differences from the data obtained through the chemical analysis of fiber and other nutritional components. Micronutrient fortification is not common in the GFB. The nutritional quality of commercial GFB is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed.",

With medical advancements, the diagnosis of allergies is becoming easier, and people who are allergic to gluten are recommended a complete gluten-free diet. Since wheat provides a major part of the energy and nutrition in the diet, its elimination affects nutrition intake of allergic population. Food scientists are working to formulate products using protein-rich gluten-free grains with quality attributes at par with gluten-containing products. Focused research has been done to provide nutrition and a variety of food to people suffering from gluten-related disorders. Efforts are being made to remove the gluten from the wheat and other gluten-containing grains, while applying different processing/treatments to enhance the properties of gluten-free grains. Hence, the present review summarizes the importance, processing, and products of different gluten-free grains. It also highlights the digestibility of gluten-free grains with clinical trials and gluten elimination strategies for gluten-containing grains.",

Taking into account the fact that diet is a key factor, it is worth exploring this aspect of CVD prevention and therapy. The aim of this article is to assess the potential of the ketogenic diet in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The article is a comprehensive, meticulous analysis of the literature in this area, taking into account the most recent studies currently available. The ketogenic diet has been shown to have a multifaceted effect on the prevention and treatment of CVD. Among other aspects, it has a beneficial effect on the blood lipid profile, even compared to other diets. It shows strong anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective potential, which is due, among other factors, to the anti-inflammatory properties of the state of ketosis, the elimination of simple sugars, the restriction of total carbohydrates and the supply of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition, ketone bodies provide \"rescue fuel\" for the diseased heart by affecting its metabolism. They also have a beneficial effect on the function of the vascular endothelium, including improving its function and inhibiting premature ageing. The ketogenic diet has a beneficial effect on blood pressure and other CVD risk factors through, among other aspects, weight loss. The evidence cited is often superior to that for standard diets, making it likely that the ketogenic diet shows advantages over other dietary models in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. There is a legitimate need for further research in this area.",

      "abstract": "Over a hundred years of study on the favourable effect of ketogenic diets in the treatment of epilepsy have contributed to a long-lasting discussion on its potential influence on other neurological diseases. A significant increase in the number of scientific studies in that field has been currently observed. The aim of this paper is a widespread, thorough analysis of the available scientific evidence in respect of the role of the ketogenic diet in the therapy of neurological diseases such as: epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and migraine. A wide range of the mechanisms of action of the ketogenic diet has been demonstrated in neurological diseases, including, among other effects, its influence on the reduction in inflammatory conditions and the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the restoration of the myelin sheath of the neurons, the formation and regeneration of mitochondria, neuronal metabolism, the provision of an alternative source of energy for neurons (ketone bodies), the reduction in glucose and insulin concentrations, the reduction in amyloid plaques, the induction of autophagy, the alleviation of microglia activation, the reduction in excessive neuronal activation, the modulation of intestinal microbiota, the expression of genes, dopamine production and the increase in glutamine conversion into GABA. The studies discussed (including randomised controlled studies), conducted in neurological patients, have stressed the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of epilepsy and have demonstrated its promising therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and migraine. A frequent advantage of the diet was demonstrated over non-ketogenic diets (in the control groups) in the therapy of neurological diseases, with simultaneous safety and feasibility when conducting the nutritional model.",

      "abstract": "Cancer cells (CCs) predominantly use aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) for their metabolism. This important characteristic of CCs represents a potential metabolic pathway to be targeted in the context of tumor treatment. Being this mechanism related to nutrient oxidation, dietary manipulation has been hypothesized as an important strategy during tumor treatment. Ketogenic diet (KD) is a dietary pattern characterized by high fat intake, moderate-to-low protein consumption, and very-low-carbohydrate intake (<50 g), which in cancer setting may target CCs metabolism, potentially influencing both tumor treatment and prognosis. Several mechanisms, far beyond the originally proposed inhibition of glucose/insulin signaling, can underpin the effectiveness of KD in cancer management, ranging from oxidative stress, mitochondrial metabolism, and inflammation. The role of a qualified Nutritionist is essential to reduce and manage the short and long-term complications of this dietary therapy, which must be personalized to the individual patient for the planning of tailored KD protocol in cancer patients. In the present review, we summarize the proposed antitumor mechanisms of KD, the application of KD in cancer patients with obesity and cachexia, and the preclinical and clinical evidence on KD therapy in cancer.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most disabling neurological diseases. Despite proper pharmacotherapy and the availability of 2nd and 3rd generation antiepileptic drugs, deep brain stimulation, and surgery, up to 30-40% of epilepsy patients remain drug-resistant. Consequences of this phenomenon include not only decreased a quality of life, and cognitive, behavioral, and personal disorders, but also an increased risk of death, i.e., in the mechanism of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP). The main goals of epilepsy treatment include three basic issues: achieving the best possible seizure control, avoiding the undesired effects of treatment, and maintaining/improving the quality of patients' lives. Therefore, numerous attempts are made to offer alternative treatments for drug-resistant seizures, an example of which is the ketogenic diet. It is a long-known but rarely used dietary therapy for intractable seizures. One of the reasons for this is the unpalatability of the classic ketogenic diet, which reduces patient compliance and adherence rates. However, its antiseizure effects are often considered to be worth the effort. Until recently, the diet was considered the last-resort treatment. Currently, it is believed that a ketogenic diet should be used much earlier in patients with well-defined indications. In correctly qualified patients, seizure activity may be reduced by over 90% or even abolished for long periods after the diet is stopped. A ketogenic diet can be used in all age groups, although most of the available literature addresses pediatric epilepsy. In this article, we focus on the mechanisms of action, effectiveness, and adverse effects of different variants of the ketogenic diet, including its classic version, a medium-chain triglyceride diet, a modified Atkins diet, and a low glycemic index treatment.",

The relationship between the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk is a controversial topic. This publication aimed to present evidence on the ketogenic diet and cardiovascular risk factors and mortality. The ketogenic diet does not fulfill the criteria of a healthy diet. It presents the potential for rapid short-term reduction of body mass, triglycerides level, Hb1Ac, and blood pressure. Its efficacy for weight loss and the above-mentioned metabolic changes is not significant in long-term observations. In terms of cardiovascular mortality, the low-carb pattern is more beneficial than very low-carbohydrate (including the ketogenic diet). There is still scarce evidence comparing ketogenic to the Mediterranean diet. Other safety concerns in cardiovascular patients such as adverse events related to ketosis, fat-free mass loss, or potential pharmacological interactions should be also taken into consideration in future research.",

      "abstract": "This review discusses the effects and mechanisms of a ketogenic diet on neurodegenerative diseases on the basis of available evidence. A ketogenic diet refers to a high-fat, mediumprotein, and low-carbohydrate diet that leads to a metabolic shift to ketosis. This review systematically summarizes the scientific literature supporting this effective treatment approach for neurodegenerative diseases, including effects on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It also highlights the clinical evidence for the effects of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease. Finally, it discusses the common adverse effects of ketogenic therapy. Although the complete mechanism of the ketogenic diet in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases remains to be elucidated, its clinical efficacy has attracted many new followers. The ketogenic diet is a good candidate for adjuvant therapy, but its specific applicability depends on the type and the degree of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Ketogenic diet therapy (KDT) is an established nonpharmacologic treatment in various types of epilepsy. We aim to evaluate the quality of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRMAs) of KDT for epilepsy and summarize the evidence on their effects. We conducted an overview on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, and Web of Science from database inception to 3 September 2020. Two investigators independently performed study selection to include SRMAs, extracted data and assessed the quality of SRMAs with the AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA statement. Twenty-four SRMAs were selected which encompassed a total of 255 original studies. Four reviews assessed the effects of KDT on infant patients; thirteen reviews reported on children and adolescent patients; eight reviews focused on adults or all patients; four assessed cognitive and behavior outcomes; three assessed quality of life; two assessed growth and development outcomes; seventeen reported on adverse effects; seven reported on retention; ten reported on attrition and reasons; and four reported on death outcomes. Overall, positive effects of KDT for epilepsy on seizure frequency reduction, as well as cognition and behavior were observed. In contrast, the effects of KDT on quality of life, growth and development were more controversial. The present overview indicates that KDT is safe. The most prevalent adverse events were GI, weight loss, and metabolic disorders, while the most common reasons for discontinuance were the lack of observed efficacy and dietary intolerance.",

There are currently FDA-approved symptomatic therapies for AD and a recently approved, potentially disease-modifying drug, Aducanumab; however, there are no curative or preventative therapies. Research suggests that diet may play a role in AD, but it is inconclusive relative to which dietary approach provides the most neuroprotective effects. There are other life-style approaches that have been found to possibly play a role in AD prevention/treatment. These include exercise, brain training, and social interaction. A combined approach may be more effective than any one modality alone. The ketogenic diet (KD) is one specific diet that has been studied vis a vis neurodegenerative diseases. Similar benefits to those of a KD can also be achieved through consuming a normal diet and supplementing with ketogenic agents. The purpose of this review is to compare the methods of inducing hyperketonemia and their impact on AD prevention/treatment, as well as to explore the possible benefits of a combined approach.",

      "abstract": "As the prevalence of smoking continues to decline, dietary factors are rapidly becoming the leading preventable cause of disease. Diet and obesity are also leading to a shift in cancer prevalence with increases noted in breast, liver, pancreas, and uterine cancers. Once cancer is detected, obesity is also associated with poorer outcomes with therapy as well as higher morbidity and mortality. Key factors are associated with the link between obesity and cancer including chronic inflammation, change in sex hormones, alteration in insulin-IGF-1 axis, alteration in adipokines, as well as cancer stem cells that are derived from adipose tissue. Because of these associations, a great deal of effort is being placed in implementing lifestyle changes that mitigate obesity-associated factors that contribute to development of cancer, reduce side effects of treatment, and improve survival. Ketogenic diet is emerging as an attractive option in countering obesity-related tumor-promoting factors, as it is associated with weight loss as well as a reduction in insulin resistance and inflammation. Ketogenic diet can also deprive cancer cells of glucose, a fuel source that is predominantly used by many cancer lines through aerobic glycolysis in the setting of dysregulated mitochondria. Current manuscript reviews the theoretical benefits for use of ketogenic diet in cancer as well as the data available from clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "The ketogenic diet, known as a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, and high-fat diet, drastically restrains the major source of energy for the body, forcing it to burn all excess fat through a process called ketosis-the breaking down of fat into ketone bodies. First suggested as a medical treatment for children suffering from epilepsy, this diet has gained increased popularity as a rapid weight loss strategy. Over the past few years, there have been numerous studies suggesting that the ketogenic diet may provide therapeutic effects for several psychiatric conditions such as mood- and anxiety-related disorders. However, despite significant progress in research, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain largely unexplored and are yet to be fully elucidated. This chapter provides an in-depth overview of preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the use of a ketogenic diet in the management of mood and anxiety disorders and discusses its relationship with inflammatory processes and potential mechanisms of actions for its therapeutic effects.",

      "title": "The Ketogenic Diet in Colorectal Cancer: A Means to an End.",
      "abstract": "Some diets, such as high lipid and high glucose diets, are known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer. On the other hand, little is known about diets that prevent colonic carcinogenesis. The ketogenic diet, which is characterized by high fat and very low carbohydrate content, is one such diet. The ketogenic diet decreases the amount of available glucose for tumors and shifts to the production of ketone bodies as an alternative energy source for healthy cells. Cancer cells are unable to use the ketone bodies for energy thus depriving them of the energy needed for progression and survival. Many studies reported the beneficial effects of the ketogenic diet in several types of cancers. Recently, the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate has been found to possess anti-tumor potential in colorectal cancer. Despite its beneficial effects, the ketogenic diet also has some drawbacks, some of which are related to gastrointestinal disorders and weight loss. Thus, studies are being directed at this time towards finding alternatives to following a strict ketogenic diet and supplementing patients with the ketone bodies responsible for its beneficial effects in the hope of overcoming some potential setbacks. This article discusses the mechanism by which a ketogenic diet influences growth and proliferation of tumor cells, it sheds the light on the most recent trials regarding its use as an adjunctive measure to chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, and it explains the limitations of its usage in metastatic patients and the promising role of exogenous ketone supplementation in this setting.",

      "abstract": "Dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) is an increasingly common syndrome with a significant burden on patients, caregivers, the health-care system, and the society. The prevalence of dementia will certainly continue to grow as the US population ages. Current treatments for dementia, though, are limited. One proposed nonpharmacologic approach for the delay or prevention of dementia is the use of a ketogenic diet. The ketogenic diet was originally employed to treat refractory epilepsy and has shown promise in many neurologic diseases. It has also gained recent popularity for its weight loss effects. Several preclinical studies have confirmed a benefit of ketosis on cognition and systemic inflammation. Given the renewed emphasis on neuroinflammation as a pathogenic contributor to cognitive decline, and the decreased systemic inflammation observed with the ketogenic diet, it is plausible that this diet may delay, ameliorate, or prevent progression of cognitive decline. Several small human studies have shown benefit on cognition in dementia with a ketogenic diet intervention. Future, large controlled studies are needed to confirm this benefit; however, the ketogenic diet has shown promise in regard to delay or mitigation of symptoms of cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the use of the ketogenic diet as a proper nutritional treatment for lipedema has been hypothesized in the literature. This is the first clinical study evaluating the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy in lipedema patients. In the present study, it was decided to use a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) in combination with carboxytherapy. Since lipedema is characterized by microangiopathy, local hypoxia, and increased subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) deposition, carboxytherapy could improve painful symptoms and skin tone. A total of 22 subjects were included in the data analysis, divided into three groups; 8 patients underwent MMKD combined with carboxytherapy sessions (KDCB group), 8 underwent MMKD nutritional treatment alone (KD group), and 6 patients underwent only carboxytherapy sessions (CB group), for a total of 10 weeks of treatment for all three groups. It was observed that the ketogenic diet effectively induced weight and fat mass loss, including in the limbs, areas considered unresponsive to diet therapy in lipedema patients. However, the best results were obtained from the combination of the ketogenic diet and carboxytherapy, which showed improvements in both body composition and skin texture and a reduction in pain, along with an improvement in sleep quality. It would be helpful to conduct a clinical trial on a larger scale and over a more extended period to observe the results in the long term as well.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC), a complex disease with several influencing factors, is significantly impacted by dietary habits. The ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by high fat and low carbohydrate intake, has gained attention as a potential therapeutic approach, but its effects on BC remain unclear. This review seeks to summarize the current knowledge on the principles of the KD, its metabolic influence on BC cells, and the findings of recent clinical trials, in order to elucidate the potential therapeutic role of the KD in BC management. For these purposes, a comprehensive literature review was conducted selecting preclinical and clinical studies that investigate the relationship between the KD and BC. The selection criteria prioritized studies exploring the KD's metabolic effects on BC cells and current clinical trials involving the KD in BC management. The reviewed studies provide a diverse range of findings, with some suggesting potential benefits of the KD in inhibiting tumor growth and improving treatment response. However, robust clinical trials providing clear evidence of the KD's efficacy as a standalone therapeutic approach in BC are still lacking. There are also significant concerns regarding the safety and long-term effects of sustained ketosis in cancer patients. The therapeutic potential of the KD in BC remains an area of active research and debate. While preliminary findings are promising, definitive conclusions are hindered by inconsistent results and limited human trial data. Future research, specifically well-structured, large-scale clinical trials, is necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of the KD in BC treatment. Until then, caution should be exercised in its application, and patients should continue prioritizing evidence-based, standard-of-care treatments.",

      "abstract": "Reviews focused on the ketogenic diet (KD) based on the increase in fat-free mass (FFM) have been carried out with pathological populations or, failing that, without population differentiation. The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to verify whether a ketogenic diet without programmed energy restriction generates increases in fat-free mass (FFM) in resistance-trained participants. We evaluated the effect of the ketogenic diet, in conjunction with resistance training, on fat-free mass in trained participants. Boolean algorithms from various databases (PubMed, Scopus. and Web of Science) were used, and a total of five studies were located that related to both ketogenic diets and resistance-trained participants. In all, 111 athletes or resistance-trained participants (87 male and 24 female) were evaluated in the studies analyzed. We found no significant differences between groups in the FFM variables, and more research is needed to perform studies with similar ketogenic diets and control diet interventions. Ketogenic diets, taking into account the possible side effects, can be an alternative for increasing muscle mass as long as energy surplus is generated; however, their application for eight weeks or more without interruption does not seem to be the best option due to the satiety and lack of adherence generated.",

The KD was formally introduced in 1921 to mimic the biochemical changes associated with fasting and gained recognition as a potent treatment for pediatric epilepsy in the mid-1990s. Recent clinical and scientific knowledge supports the use of the KD in drug-resistant epilepsy patients for its anti-seizure efficacy, safety, and tolerability. The KD is also receiving growing attention as a potential treatment option for other neurological disorders. This article will review on the recent updates on the KD, focusing on its mechanisms of action, its alternatives, expansion on its use in terms of age groups and different regions in the world, and future issues.",

      "abstract": "The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate and adequate-protein diet that has gained popularity in recent years in the context of neurological diseases (NDs). The complexity of the pathogenesis of these diseases means that effective forms of treatment are still lacking. Conventional therapy is often associated with increasing tolerance and/or drug resistance. Consequently, more effective therapeutic strategies are being sought to increase the effectiveness of available forms of therapy and improve the quality of life of patients. For the moment, it seems that KD can provide therapeutic benefits in patients with neurological problems by effectively controlling the balance between pro- and antioxidant processes and pro-excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and modulating inflammation or changing the composition of the gut microbiome. In this review we evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of KD in epilepsy, depression, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. In our opinion, KD should be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic option for some neurological diseases.",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an immune-mediated neuro-inflammatory disease and diet is a possible factor in its pathogenesis. The aim of this work is to investigate the main potential targets of MS-related impairments, in particular the cognitive deficits, focusing on the alteration of biomarkers such as the Brain Derived-Neurotrophic Factor and the Tryptophan/Kynurenine ratio that could play a role on neuroprotection and thus on MS progression. Furthermore, we here propose nutritional suggestions which are useful in the development of a ketogenic diet protocol that takes advantage of the anti-inflammatory properties of low-carbohydrate foods from the Mediterranean diet to be applied to subjects with MS. In conclusion, this approach will allow one to develop the ketogenic diet combined with a modified Mediterranean diet as a possible tool to improve neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis.",

This is associated with a reduction in glucose-lowering medications. The weight loss observed after a short time period seems to be maintained with a long-term diet. Adequate support (supportive psychological counseling, enhancing positive affectivity, reinforcing mindful eating) is necessary to achieve a benefit and to assure adherence. Despite the documented decrease in HbA1, a definitive causal effect of KD remains to be proven. KD should be performed under strict medical supervision. Future research should clarify how compliance can be maximized and how ketosis can be optimally monitored.",

      "title": "The Effect of Ketogenic Diet on Shared Risk Factors of Cardiovascular Disease and Cancer.",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the first and second leading causes of death worldwide, respectively. Epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that the incidence of cancer is elevated in patients with CVD and vice versa. However, these conditions are usually regarded as separate events despite the presence of shared risk factors between both conditions, such as metabolic abnormalities and lifestyle. Cohort studies suggested that controlling for CVD risk factors may have an impact on cancer incidence. Therefore, it could be concluded that interventions that improve CVD and cancer shared risk factors may potentially be effective in preventing and treating both diseases. The ketogenic diet (KD), a low-carbohydrate and high-fat diet, has been widely prescribed in weight loss programs for metabolic abnormalities. Furthermore, recent research has investigated the effects of KD on the treatment of numerous diseases, including CVD and cancer, due to its role in promoting ketolysis, ketogenesis, and modifying many other metabolic pathways with potential favorable health effects. However, there is still great debate regarding prescribing KD in patients either with CVD or cancer. Considering the number of studies on this topic, there is a clear need to summarize potential mechanisms through which KD can improve cardiovascular health and control cell proliferation. In this review, we explained the history of KD, its types, and physiological effects and discussed how it could play a role in CVD and cancer treatment and prevention.",

      "abstract": "Infertility affects 15% of the population in developed countries, and its prevalence is increasing. Fertility can be influenced by different factors. Although key factors like maternal age cannot be changed, there is growing evidence that other modifiable factors, such as diet, can have an impact on fertility. Diet has become increasingly important in recent years for a number of reasons: the new trend toward a healthy lifestyle, the higher prevalence of certain digestive disorders, a lack of time that leads people to consume more prepared and processed food, and personal choice to not eat meat, among others. To meet these needs, several diets have recently become popular, such as the Mediterranean diet, known as the gold standard of health; the DASH diet, known for preventing hypertension; the Western diet, characterized by processed food; the ketogenic diet, characterized by low carbohydrate intake; and the vegetarian diet, which is the choice for people who do not eat meat or animal by-products. Diets present a unique composition characterized by the presence or absence of specific nutrients, which have also been associated with male and female fertility individually. This review assesses the impact of these diets and of macro- and micronutrients on both female and male fertility.",

      "abstract": "The ketogenic diet is known to be a possible adjuvant treatment in several medical conditions, such as in patients with severe or drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. Its use has recently been increasing among adolescents and young adults due to its supposed weight-loss effect, mediated by lipolysis and lowered insulin levels. However, there are still no precise indications on the possible use of ketogenic diets in pediatric age for weight loss. This approach has also recently been proposed for other types of disorder such as inherited metabolic disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome, and some specific types of cancers. Due to its unbalanced ratio of lipids, carbohydrates and proteins, a clinical evaluation of possible side effects with a strict evaluation of growth and nutritional status is essential in all patients following a long-term restrictive diet such as the ketogenic one. The prophylactic use of micronutrients supplementation should be considered before starting any ketogenic diet. Lastly, while there is sufficient literature on possible short-term side effects of ketogenic diets, their possible long-term impact on growth and nutritional status is not yet fully understood, especially when started in pediatric age.",

      "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. Hyperandrogenism, hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance (IR) are the main drivers of clinical, metabolic and reproductive phenotypes of PCOS. In adolescence, the cornerstones of PCOS treatment are lifestyle and dietary interventions. In particular, the quality and quantity of carbohydrates introduced with the diet play a crucial role in the benefits of diet on PCOS. Recently, the ketogenic diet (KD) has attracted significant interest for the treatment of IR and for the control of carbohydrate metabolism, which has proven to be beneficial for several dysmetabolic conditions, including PCOS. The goal of the KD is to induce a fasting-like metabolism with production of chetonic bodies. Ketosis is a good regulator of calorie intake and mimics the starvation effect in the body, leading to body weight control and consequent metabolism. Additionally, during ketogenesis, insulin receptor sensitivity is also promoted. We proposed a broad overview of the available literature regarding KD indications and considered its metabolic benefits useful for improving PCOS management. The reported data support that a low-calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) plays a positive role as a regulator of control weight, IR, glucose and lipid homeostasis and hormonal profile. Unfortunately, the evidence concerning the benefits of the very LCKD in adolescents with PCOS and excessive body weight is still numerically scarce. Further studies are necessary to understand whether these effects are due to weight loss or to the nutritional characteristics of this diet. Considering the long-term consequences of PCOS, it is crucial to detect the prospects of nutritional interventions to protect fertility, starting in adolescence.",

LI affects women almost exclusively, and its painful and life-changing symptoms have long been thought to be resistant to the lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise. In this paper, we discuss possible mechanisms by which patients adopting a ketogenic diet (KD) can alleviate many of the unwanted clinical features of LI. This paper is also an effort to provide evidence for the hypothesis of the potency of this dietary intervention for addressing the symptoms of LI. Specifically, we examine the scientific evidence of effectiveness of adopting a KD by patients to alleviate clinical features associated with LI, including excessive and disproportionate lower body adipose tissue (AT) deposition, pain, and reduction in quality of life (QoL). We also explore several clinical features of LI currently under debate, including the potential existence and nature of edema, metabolic and hormonal dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. The effectiveness of a KD on addressing clinical features of LI has been demonstrated in human studies, and shows promise as an intervention for LI. We hope this paper leads to an improved understanding of optimal nutritional management for patients with LI and stimulates future research in this area of study.",

In this review, we summarize the clinical evidence for anti-tumor effects, as well as the effects on anthropometry, quality of life, adverse events and adherence in cancer patients. In April 2019, a systematic search was conducted searching five electronic databases (EMBASE, Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) to find studies analyzing the use, effectiveness and potential harm of a ketogenic diet in cancer patients of any age as sole or complementary therapy. From all 19.211 search results, 46 publications concerning 39 studies with 770 patients were included in this systematic review. The therapy concepts included all forms of diets with reduced carbohydrate intake, that aimed to achieve ketosis for patients with different types of cancer. Most studies had a low quality, high risk of bias and were highly heterogeneous. There was no conclusive evidence for anti-tumor effects or improved OS. The majority of patients had significant weight loss and mild to moderate side effects. Adherence to the diet was rather low in most studies. Due to the very heterogeneous results and methodological limitations of the included studies, clinical evidence for the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in cancer patients is still lacking.",

      "title": "The effects of the ketogenic diet on cancer treatment: a narrative review.",
      "abstract": "Despite significant advances in therapy, cancer remains the top cause of death in parts of the globe. For many types of cancer, the typical treatment is a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, this conventional treatment is not successful on its own. As a consequence, innovative approaches that improve treatment efficacy are urgently needed. The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate protein, and low-carbohydrate diet that appears to sensitize most cancers to conventional therapies by exploiting cancer cells' altered metabolism, making it an effective adjuvant cancer treatment alternative. This diet could decrease glucose metabolism while enhancing lipid metabolism, interfering with the Warburg effect, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation. The anticancer impact of ketogenic diet has been established in numerous animal trials and clinical investigations on a wide range of tumor types, including glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, head and neck cancer, breast cancer, invasive rectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer. In this review, we discussed the various types of ketogenic diets, the mechanism of action for ketogenic diet as a cancer therapy, and the data gathered from continuing preclinical and clinical studies, intending to establish a solid theoretical foundation for future research.",

However, a large variance in the study design and observations is presented, which needs to be comprehensively assessed. We here thus completed a systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the effects of the intervention combining CT and LCHF on body composition and aerobic capacity in people with training experience as compared to that combining CT and other dietary strategies. (2) Methods: A search strategy based on the PICOS principle was used to find literature in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Sport-discuss, and Medline. The quality and risk of bias in the studies were independently assessed by two researchers. (3) Result: Eight studies consisting of 170 participants were included in this work. The pooled results showed no significant effects of CT with LCHF on lean mass (SMD = -0.08, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.3, ",

If refractory SE arises, general anesthetics should be used in generalized convulsive and non-convulsive SE in coma, while further non-sedating anti-seizure medications attempts are warranted in patients with focal forms. Ketogenic diet and/or ketamine in patients with super-refractory SE, and immunologic treatments for those with new-onset refractory SE/febrile-induced refractory epilepsy syndrome should be considered early. Pharmacologic treatment of SE after cardiac arrest should be oriented by the results of multimodal prognostication.",

This review is directed at raising awareness among dermatologists on the potential uses of KD in managing skin disorders, such as acne, psoriasis, and hidradenitis suppurativa, among others. In addition, cutaneous adverse reactions, such as prurigo pigmentosa and nutritional deficiencies, which have been associated with KD, are also discussed in this review.",

With the growing popularity of various dietary strategies, evidence suggests that combining exercise with dietary interventions offers greater benefits than either approach alone. Consequently, this combined strategy has become a preferred method for many individuals aiming to maintain health. Calorie restriction, 5/2 intermittent fasting, time-restricted feeding, and the ketogenic diet are among the most popular dietary interventions today. Aerobic exercise, resistance training, and mixed exercise are the most widely practiced forms of physical activity. Exploring the best combinations of these approaches to determine which yields the most effective results is both meaningful and valuable. Despite this trend, a comparative analysis of the effects of different exercise and diet combinations is lacking. This study uses network meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of various combined interventions on body composition and to compare their efficacy.",

Ketogenic dieting has been proposed as an effective intervention for type 2 diabetes and obesity since glycemic control is improved and sustained weight loss can be achieved. Interestingly, hyperketonemia is also associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects, possibly caused by improved cardiac energetics and reduced oxygen use. Therefore, the KD has the potential to both treat and prevent cardiovascular disease. However, the KD has some adverse effects that could counteract the beneficial cardiovascular properties. Of these, hyperlipidemia with elevation of triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels are the most important. In addition, poor diet adherence and lack of knowledge regarding long-term effects may also reduce the broader applicability of the KD. The objective of this narrative review is to provide insights into the KD and its effects on myocardial ketone body utilization and, consequently, cardiovascular health.",

      "abstract": "Most women in the United States do not meet the recommendations for healthful nutrition and weight before and during pregnancy. Women and providers often ask what a healthy diet for a pregnant woman should look like. The message should be \"eat better, not more.\" This can be achieved by basing diet on a variety of nutrient-dense, whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats with omega-3 fatty acids that include nuts and seeds, and fish, in place of poorer quality highly processed foods. Such a diet embodies nutritional density and is less likely to be accompanied by excessive energy intake than the standard American diet consisting of increased intakes of processed foods, fatty red meat, and sweetened foods and beverages. Women who report \"prudent\" or \"health-conscious\" eating patterns before and/or during pregnancy may have fewer pregnancy complications and adverse child health outcomes. Comprehensive nutritional supplementation (multiple micronutrients plus balanced protein energy) among women with inadequate nutrition has been associated with improved birth outcomes, including decreased rates of low birthweight. A diet that severely restricts any macronutrient class should be avoided, specifically the ketogenic diet that lacks carbohydrates, the Paleo diet because of dairy restriction, and any diet characterized by excess saturated fats. User-friendly tools to facilitate a quick evaluation of dietary patterns with clear guidance on how to address dietary inadequacies and embedded support from trained healthcare providers are urgently needed. Recent evidence has shown that although excessive gestational weight gain predicts adverse perinatal outcomes among women with normal weight, the degree of prepregnancy obesity predicts adverse perinatal outcomes to a greater degree than gestational weight gain among women with obesity. Furthermore, low body mass index and insufficient gestational weight gain are associated with poor perinatal outcomes. Observational data have shown that first-trimester gain is the strongest predictor of adverse outcomes. Interventions beginning in early pregnancy or preconception are needed to prevent downstream complications for mothers and their children. For neonates, human milk provides personalized nutrition and is associated with short- and long-term health benefits for infants and mothers. Eating a healthy diet is a way for lactating mothers to support optimal health for themselves and their infants.",

      "abstract": "The global prevalence of obesity is alarmingly high and is impacting both developed and underdeveloped countries, beyond the borders of ethnicity, sex, and age. On the other hand, the global interest in dieting has increased, and people are obsessed with certain fad diets, assuming them as a magic bullet for their long-term problems. A fad diet is a popular dietary pattern known to be a quick fix for obesity. These diets are quite appealing due to the proposed claims, but the lack of scientific evidence is a big question mark. Such diets are often marketed with specific claims that defy the basic principles of biochemistry and nutritional adequacy. These diets may have protective effects against obesity and certain chronic diseases like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and certain cancers. Limited evidence exists to support the proposed claims; rather certain studies suggest the negative health consequences of long-term adherence to such dietary patterns. Many fad diets have emerged in the previous few decades. This review article will explore the current evidence related to the health impacts of some most popular diets: Atkins diet, ketogenic diet, Paleolithic diet, Mediterranean diet, vegetarian diet, intermittent fasting and detox diet.",

      "abstract": "The promotion of healthy diets is likely one of the most cost-effective strategies for preventing a wide range of disorders, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. The majority of present non-communicable chronic diseases are attributed to civilization, an abundance of food, and a lack of physical activity. According to the purported lifestyles of early humans, the paleolithic diet (PD) encourages the intake of wild animal and plant foods. In recent decades, the paleolithic diet has grown in popularity, particularly among younger populations and those with cardiometabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases. Due to the nutrition profile of the paleolithic diet, historical studies have postulated that hunter-gatherers (HGs) have slender physiques and were physically fit and devoid of chronic ailments such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This review highlights the composition/constituent of the paleolithic diet along with an emphasis on current studies and evidence on the effectiveness of the paleolithic diet in mitigating chronic diseases.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this meta-analysis was to review the impact of a Paleolithic diet (PD) on selected health indicators (body composition, lipid profile, blood pressure, and carbohydrate metabolism) in the short and long term of nutrition intervention in healthy and unhealthy adults. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials of 21 full-text original human studies was conducted. Both the PD and a variety of healthy diets (control diets (CDs)) caused reduction in anthropometric parameters, both in the short and long term. For many indicators, such as weight (body mass (BM)), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC), impact was stronger and especially found in the short term. All diets caused a decrease in total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides (TG), albeit the impact of PD was stronger. Among long-term studies, only PD cased a decline in TC and LDL-C. Impact on blood pressure was observed mainly in the short term. PD caused a decrease in fasting plasma (fP) glucose, fP insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the short run, contrary to CD. In the long term, only PD caused a decrease in fP glucose and fP insulin. Lower positive impact of PD on performance was observed in the group without exercise. Positive effects of the PD on health and the lack of experiments among professional athletes require longer-term interventions to determine the effect of the Paleo diet on athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "Anyone who wants to understand the biological nature of humans and their special characteristics must look far back into evolutionary history. Today's way of life is drastically different from that of our ancestors. For almost 99% of human history, gathering and hunting have been the basis of nutrition. It was not until about 12,000 years ago that humans began domesticating plants and animals. Bioarchaeologically and biochemically, this can be traced back to our earliest roots. Modern living conditions and the quality of human life are better today than ever before. However, neither physically nor psychosocially have we made this adjustment and we are paying a high health price for it. The studies presented allow us to reconstruct food supply, lifestyles, and dietary habits: from the earliest primates, through hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic, farming communities since the beginning of the Anthropocene, to the Industrial Age and the present. The comprehensive data pool allows extraction of all findings of medical relevance. Our recent lifestyle and diet are essentially determined by our culture rather than by our millions of years of ancestry. Culture is permanently in a dominant position compared to natural evolution. Thereby culture does not form a contrast to nature but represents its result. There is no doubt that we are biologically adapted to culture, but it is questionable how much culture humans can cope with.",

      "abstract": "Despite the emergence of stronger nutritional science over the past two decades, fad diets remain highly popular. However, growing medical evidence has led to the endorsement of healthy eating patterns by medical societies. This thus allows fad diets to be compared to the emerging scientific evidence as to which diets promote or damage health. In this narrative review, the most popular current fad diets are critically analyzed, including low-fat diets, vegan and vegetarian diets, low-carbohydrate diets, ketogenic diets, Paleolithic diets, and intermittent fasting. Each of these diets has some scientific merit, but each has potential deficiencies relative to the findings of nutritional science. This article also presents the common themes that emerge among the dietary guidance of leading health organizations, such as the American Heart Association and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine. While there are important distinctions between dietary recommendations emanating from various medical societies, each recommends eating more unrefined, plant-based foods, while eating fewer highly processed foods and added sugars, and avoiding excessive calorie consumption as an important nutritional strategy for the prevention and management of chronic conditions and promotion of overall health.",

An analysis of PubMed materials was conducted to assess the impact of nutrition on the condition of the oral mucosa and periodontium. We also considered dietary habits such as vegetarianism, the ketogenic diet, the Paleo diet, the Mediterranean diet, the Western diet, and intermittent fasting. Vitamin deficiencies, both watersoluble and fat-soluble, as well as macroand microelements, can manifest in the oral cavity, among others, as gingivitis and bleeding, recurrent aphthous stomatitis, enamel hypomineralization, cheilitis, angular cheilitis, halitosis, glossitis, lingual papillae atrophy, and stomatitis. Malnutrition does not cause periodontal disease, but it increases the risk of its occurrence and accelerates disease progression. Inadequate nutrition, combined with other predisposing factors, may contribute to an increased risk of oral cancer and the development of leukoplakia.",

      "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent hepatic disease globally. NAFLD patients are at an increased risk of both liver and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, as well as all-cause death. NAFLD prevalence is rapidly increasing worldwide and, thus, there is an urgent need for health policies to tackle its development and complications. Currently, since there is no drug therapy officially indicated for this disease, lifestyle interventions remain the first-line therapeutic option. In the present narrative review, we discuss the effects of certain dietary patterns on NAFLD incidence and progression. The Mediterranean diet is regarded as the diet of choice for the prevention/treatment of NAFLD and its complications, based on the available evidence. Other plant-based dietary patterns (poor in saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, red and processed meats) are also beneficial [i.e., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and vegetarian/vegan diets], whereas more data are needed to establish the role of ketogenic, intermittent fasting and paleo diets in NAFLD. Nevertheless, there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" dietary intervention for NAFLD management. Clinicians should discuss with their patients and define the diet that each individual prefers and is able to implement in his/her daily life.",

      "abstract": "Despite being a focal issue to patients, the effect of diet on adult inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains underexplored with limited guidance. While promising clinical trials are currently underway, there is a need for further evidence-based recommendations. As such, we summarize the current evidence on various diets used in the treatment of IBD and also explore the potential applications of dietary data from related immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, to provide additional information to inform IBD providers. To date, there have been multiple diets investigated as adjunctive therapy in IBD, but many associated studies are small, non-randomized, and not controlled. Mediterranean, vegetarian/vegan, and reduced-calorie/fasting diets have been studied and have shown some positive results in other IMIDs, which may suggest potential applicability to those with IBD, but larger, well-designed clinical trials are needed for further guidance. Gluten-free and low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP)diets do not appear to have an impact on IBD disease activity, but low FODMAP may potentially be helpful for those with concurrent functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Specific carbohydrate diets have been mainly assessed in children but show some potential in small adult studies.",

      "title": "The Effects of the Paleo Diet on Autoimmune Thyroid Disease: A Mixed Methods Review.",
      "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review was to examine the characteristics of Paleolithic diet (PD) interventions designed for adult patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) in order to determine if diet elements have the potential to successfully reduce thyroid antibodies (Ab) such as thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), and improve thyroid hormones (thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)) or resolve AITD pathogenesis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an adult population of 18 years and older, diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) or Graves' disease (GD) (Basedow's), who were placed on a diet of Paleolithic or ancestral nature, and achieved reduction of AITD Abs, improvement of thyroid hormones, and, or resolution of AITD were searched. Various electronic databases were used. Bias was assessed using critical appraisal tools from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). Studies were excluded according to exclusion criteria and results analyzed. One randomized controlled trial (RCT), a pilot study, and six case studies were found. In total, eight AITD studies focusing on Paleolithic or ancestral interventions were located. In highlight, females were the predominant gender. Case studies solely focused on AITD with protocols ranging from 8-60 weeks. All studies showed clinical improvements, one had significant improvement, two showed AITD resolution. After structured evaluation of nutritional interventions utilizing the PD on the effects of AITD, it was concluded foods of ancestral nature along with the addition of specific supplements, food components, exercise and mindfulness meditation, and exclusion of modern day foods have a considerable impact on thyroid Ab and hormones. The relevant studies suggest while this dietary protocol can be useful in clinical practice, larger-scale studies need to be conducted. Key teaching pointsThere are currently no dietary interventions recommended for the treatment of autoimmune thyroid disease. The Paleo diet has been documented to improve AITD antibodies and thyroid hormones in both Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease.The Paleo diet can provide a natural source of nutrients similar to supplemental nutrients that have shown positive results on AITD.The paleo diet provides specific macronutrient percentages that may be beneficial in reducing AITD antibodies, while improving thyroid hormones.Methylation supplementation may be useful in AITD cases.",

      "abstract": "In recent decades, traditional eating habits have been replaced by a more globalized diet, rich in saturated fatty acids and simple sugars. Extensive evidence shows that these dietary factors contribute to cognitive health impairment as well as increase the incidence of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. However, how these nutrients modulate synaptic function and neuroplasticity is poorly understood. We review the Western, ketogenic, and paleolithic diets for their effects on cognition and correlations with synaptic changes, focusing mainly (but not exclusively) on animal model studies aimed at tracing molecular alterations that may contribute to impaired human cognition. We observe that memory and learning deficits mediated by high-fat/high-sugar diets, even over short exposure times, are associated with reduced arborization, widened synaptic cleft, narrowed post-synaptic zone, and decreased activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and also observe that these alterations correlate with deregulation of the AMPA-type glutamate ionotropic receptors (AMPARs) that are crucial to neuroplasticity. Furthermore, we explored which diet-mediated mechanisms modulate synaptic AMPARs and whether certain supplements or nutritional interventions could reverse deleterious effects, contributing to improved learning and memory in older people and patients with Alzheimer's disease.",

Fifteen athletes were assigned to two groups: 9 in the experimental group (PD) and 6 in the control group (CD). Significant decreases in body mass (BM), body mass index (BMI), and fat mass (FM) as well as an increase in the fat-free mass (FFM) (%) in both groups were observed. There were no significant differences between groups in particular series during the experiment in all haematological and biochemical indicators of blood and urine. Only HDL-C was significantly higher in the last series in the PD compared to the CD (1.63 mmol/l vs. 1.23 mmol/l). In the Wingate test, there were only single intragroup changes, consisting of a significant decrease in the Wt, MAP and Pmean in the experimental group. There were no significant differences between the groups in individual series or intragroup differences during the experiment, determined by the VO",

      "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by painful inflammatory lesions, predominantly affecting areas of the skin rich in apocrine glands, such as inguinal, axillary, submammary, and anogenital regions, with an estimated global prevalence between 1%-4%. The treatment of HS is challenging with various treatment modalities employed to control the disease. Since the condition is chronic and life-impairing, many patients have looked for ways to complement their conventional treatment procedures with non-medical interventions, among which dietary interventions have been of particular interest. Researchers have looked for ways to connect the gastrointestinal system with the skin through the ˝skin-gut axis concept˝ introducing a strong association between the microbiome of the gastrointestinal system and the skin. In addition, diet stimulation of insulin and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) may impact signaling pathways playing a role in HS pathogenesis. Patients have tried various dietary interventions to alleviate their symptoms of inflammation and suppuration. Among the different dietary approaches that have been described are paleo, autoimmune, Mediterranean, and elimination diet regimes. Dietary supplements have become the mainstay of lifestyle factors aimed at improving the clinical signs and symptoms of HS. This review aims to synthesize and present the current findings on diet as a modifiable factor in HS, helping the patients to navigate through the data and helping them make informed choices on their healthy lifestyles.",

The Wahls diet may reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction and has plausible mechanisms for slowing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression. However, research on its dietary components in the ALS animal models has yielded conflicting results. Though multiple cohort studies suggest high carotenoids, omega-3 fatty acids and fruit intake are associated with reduced ALS risks, neither the diet nor its components has been demonstrated to slow down ALS progression in case studies or clinical trials. On the contrary, the Wahls diet, a restrictive, low-carbohydrate and low glycemic index diet, caused an average weight loss of 7.2% BMI in multiple sclerosis clinical trials, which is a significant concern for people living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (PALS) as weight loss is associated with faster ALS progression and shorter survival. Considering the above, we cannot endorse the Wahls diet for slowing ALS progression.",

      "abstract": "The early onset of weaning in modern humans has been linked to the high nutritional demand of brain development that is intimately connected with infant physiology and growth rate. In Neanderthals, ontogenetic patterns in early life are still debated, with some studies suggesting an accelerated development and others indicating only subtle differences vs. modern humans. Here we report the onset of weaning and rates of enamel growth using an unprecedented sample set of three late (∼70 to 50 ka) Neanderthals and one Upper Paleolithic modern human from northeastern Italy via spatially resolved chemical/isotopic analyses and histomorphometry of deciduous teeth. Our results reveal that the modern human nursing strategy, with onset of weaning at 5 to 6 mo, was present among these Neanderthals. This evidence, combined with dental development akin to modern humans, highlights their similar metabolic constraints during early life and excludes late weaning as a factor contributing to Neanderthals' demise.",

      "abstract": "Appropriate diet can prevent, manage, or reverse noncommunicable health conditions such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Consequently, the public's interest in diet and nutrition has fueled the multi-billion-dollar weight loss industry and elevated its standing on social media and the internet. Although many dietary approaches are popular, their universal effectiveness and risks across overall populations are not clear. The objective of this scoping review was to identify and characterize systematic reviews (SRs) examining diet or fasting (intermittent energy restriction [IER]) interventions among adults who are healthy or may have chronic disease. An in-depth literature search of six databases was conducted for SRs published between January 2010 and February 2020. A total of 22,385 SRs were retrieved, and 1,017 full-text articles were screened for eligibility. Of these, 92 SRs met inclusion criteria. Covered diets were organized into 12 categories: high/restricted carbohydrate (n = 30), Mediterranean, Nordic, and Tibetan (n = 19), restricted or modified fat (n = 17), various vegetarian diets (n = 16), glycemic index (n = 13), high protein (n = 12), IER (n = 11), meal replacements (n = 11), paleolithic (n = 8), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypretension (DASH; n = 6), Atkins, South Beach, and Zone (n = 5), and eight other brand diets (n = 4). Intermediate outcomes, such as body weight or composition and cardiometabolic, were commonly reported. Abundant evidence was found exploring dietary approaches in the general population. However, heterogeneity of diet definitions, focus on single macronutrients, and infrequent macronutrient subanalyses were observed. Based on this scoping review, the Evidence Analysis Center prioritized the need to collate evidence related to macronutrient modification, specifically restricted carbohydrate diets.",

      "title": "Reconstructing Neanderthal diet: The case for carbohydrates.",
      "abstract": "Evidence for plants rarely survives on Paleolithic sites, while animal bones and biomolecular analyses suggest animal produce was important to hominin populations, leading to the perspective that Neanderthals had a very-high-protein diet. But although individual and short-term survival is possible on a relatively low-carbohydrate diet, populations are unlikely to have thrived and reproduced without plants and the carbohydrates they provide. Today, nutritional guidelines recommend that around half the diet should be carbohydrate, while low intake is considered to compromise physical performance and successful reproduction. This is likely to have been the same for Paleolithic populations, highlighting an anomaly in that the basic physiological recommendations do not match the extensive archaeological evidence. Neanderthals had large, energy-expensive brains and led physically active lifestyles, suggesting that for optimal health they would have required high amounts of carbohydrates. To address this anomaly, we begin by outlining the essential role of carbohydrates in the human reproduction cycle and the brain and the effects on physical performance. We then evaluate the evidence for resource availability and the archaeological evidence for Neanderthal diet and investigate three ways that the anomaly between the archaeological evidence and the hypothetical dietary requirements might be explained. First, Neanderthals may have had an as yet unidentified genetic adaptation to an alternative physiological method to spare blood glucose and glycogen reserves for essential purposes. Second, they may have existed on a less-than-optimum diet and survived rather than thrived. Third, the methods used in dietary reconstruction could mask a complex combination of dietary plant and animal proportions. We end by proposing that analyses of Paleolithic diet and subsistence strategies need to be grounded in the minimum recommendations throughout the life course and that this provides a context for interpretation of the archaeological evidence from the behavioral and environmental perspectives.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the PD on body composition, concentration of carbohydrates and lipids, as well as insulin, irisin, adiponectin and leptin in the blood. A total of 25 handball players were assigned to two groups: 14 in the experimental group (PD) and 11 in the control group (CD), using a PD and a rational diet, respectively. Analysis of body mass and body composition (body mass index, fat mass, lean body mass, fat-free mass, muscle mass, bone mineral content and bone mineral density), as well as blood concentration of metabolism markers (glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, β-hydroxybutyrate, irisin, adiponectin and leptin), were determined at the beginning and after 4 and 8 weeks of nutritional intervention.

      "abstract": "Diabetes is a metabolic disease with a high worldwide prevalence and an important factor in mortality and disability in the population. Complications can be reduced or prevented with lifestyle changes in physical activity, dietary habits, and smoking cessation. High-protein diets (HPDs, >30% or >1.0 g/Kg/day) decrease hyperglycemia in part due to their content of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), mainly leucine. Leucine (and other BCAAs) improve glucose metabolism by directly signaling in the medio-basal hypothalamus (MBH), increasing liver insulin sensitivity. To determine the effectiveness of an HPD to lower hyperglycemia, we analyzed the results of published clinical studies focusing on the levels of fasting plasma glucose and/or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We carried out a systematic search for clinical studies using HPDs. We searched five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Epistemonikos, and Cochrane), collecting 179 articles and finally selecting 8 articles to analyze their results. In conclusion, HPDs are an effective alternative to reduce hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM, especially so-called Paleolithic diets, due to their higher-quality protein from animal and vegetal sources and their exclusion of grains, dairy products, salt, refined fats, and added sugars.",

We briefly review the evidence on health-relevant practices and status of our Paleolithic ancestors and contrast these with current food, transportation, work and governance systems with their associated impacts on human health. As public health and planning practitioners engaged in the EcoHealth Ontario Collaborative, we argue for recognition of our hunter-gatherer nature to promote joint efforts in building sustainable and equitable community infrastructures, both built and green. Although such efforts are underway at multiple jurisdictional levels across Canada, the pace is frustratingly slow for the burden of endemic chronic diseases and global environmental change which humans face. Reminding reluctant stakeholders of the hunter-gatherers in us all could bring about deeper reflection on the urgent work in redirecting community planning.",

      "title": "Aging and \"Age-Related\" Diseases - What Is the Relation?",
      "abstract": "The study explores the intricate relationship between aging and the development of noncommunicable diseases [NCDs], focusing on whether these diseases are inevitable consequences of aging or primarily driven by lifestyle factors. By examining epidemiological data, particularly from hunter-gatherer societies, the study highlights that many NCDs prevalent in modern populations are rare in these societies, suggesting a significant influence of lifestyle choices. It delves into the mechanisms through which poor diet, smoking, and other lifestyle factors contribute to systemic physiological imbalances, characterized by oxidative stress, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, and dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and the immune system. The interplay between this pattern and individual factors such as genetic susceptibility, biological variability, epigenetic changes and the microbiome is proposed to play a crucial role in the development of a range of age-related NCDs. Modified biomolecules such as oxysterols and advanced glycation end products also contribute to their development. Specific diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, Parkinson's disease, glaucoma and osteoarthritis are analyzed to illustrate these mechanisms. The study concludes that while aging contributes to the risk of NCDs, lifestyle factors play a crucial role, offering potential avenues for prevention and intervention through healthier living practices. One possible approach could be to try to restore the physiological balance, e.g. through dietary measures [e.g. Mediterranean diet, Okinawan diet or Paleolithic diet] in conjunction with [a combination of] pharmacological interventions and other lifestyle changes.",

How do human subsistence strategies accommodate our expanded energy budgets? We found that relative to other great apes, human hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers spend more energy but less time on subsistence, acquire substantially more energy per hour, and achieve similar energy efficiencies. These findings revise our understanding of human energetic evolution by indicating that humans afford expanded energy budgets primarily by increasing rates of energy acquisition, not through energy-saving adaptations such as economical bipedalism or sophisticated tool use that decrease subsistence costs and improve the energetic efficiency of subsistence. We argue that the time saved by human subsistence strategies provides more leisure time for social interaction and social learning in central-place locations and would have been critical for cumulative cultural evolution.",

      "abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Sites of acute inflammation become austere environments for the procurement of energy. The combination of oxygen depletion (hypoxia) and decreased glucose availability requires surprising metabolic adaptability. In this issue of the JCI, Watts et al. examined the metabolic adaptability of murine neutrophils to the setting of acute pulmonary inflammation elicited by exposure to nebulized endotoxin. While neutrophils are generally considered a primarily glycolytic cell type, Watts et al. used a combination of labeled amino acids and high-resolution proteomics to reveal that the harsh environment of the inflammatory lesion drives neutrophils toward de novo protein synthesis and extracellular protein scavenging as a primary fuel. This study provides compelling evidence that tissue neutrophils scavenge extracellular proteins to fuel carbon metabolism, which aids in de novo protein synthesis and the promotion of an inflammatory phenotype. These observations reveal the surprisingly creative extent to which cells and tissues might adapt to energy-deficient inflammatory environments.",

      "abstract": "Quantitative rankings of multiple dietary patterns for their effects on non-communicable disease (NCD) biomarkers is lacking and would inform primary prevention strategies. Accordingly, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to compare and rank the effects of different dietary patterns on NCD biomarkers, and associations of dietary patterns’ underlying macronutrient composition with NCD biomarkers were determined by a nutritional geometry approach. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible for inclusion if they enrolled healthy participants, employed food-based dietary pattern interventions without energy restriction, and reported NCD biomarker outcomes. NCD biomarkers were included as an outcome if ≥10 trials were available. A systematic search of five electronic databases identified 4008 records. Sixty-eight articles from 59 RCTs reporting lipids, glycemic, and inflammatory biomarkers were included for quantitative syntheses. Risk-of-bias was predominantly categorized as low or having some concerns, and confidence-of-evidence low. Relative to western habitual diet, the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), dietary guidelines-based, plant-based, and low-fat diets reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean difference range: −0.29 to −0.17 mmol/L), total cholesterol (−0.36 to −0.24 mmol/L), and apolipoprotein B (−0.11 to −0.07 g/L) (all p < 0.05); the Paleo, plant-based and dietary guidelines-based diets reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (−0.95 to −0.35, all p < 0.05). No dietary pattern ranked consistently highest. The Paleo diet received the highest all-outcomes-combined average Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve value (67%), followed by DASH (62%) and Mediterranean diets (57%), whereas western habitual diet was lowest (36%). Our findings were independent of macronutrient composition, highlighting the significance of dietary pattern-level analysis.",

The ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting in particular have shown promising results in clinical and sports medicine. The Mediterranean diet, in turn, is widely recognized for its numerous health benefits. Also popular are the paleo diet and vegan and gluten-free diets. Positive effects on inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and acne, have been observed in patients who practice intermittent fasting or follow ketogenic or Mediterranean diets. This last choice may also protect against certain skin cancers. We review the role of several popular diets in the management of skin disorders.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is currently one of the biggest public health challenges worldwide, ranking as the second leading cause of death globally. To date, strong epidemiological associations have been demonstrated between unhealthy lifestyles and eating habits, i.e. obesity, and an increased risk of developing cancer. However, there is limited evidence regarding the impact of specific dietary regimes on cancer outcomes during conventional cancer treatments. This paper systematically reviews and evaluates preclinical and clinical evidence regarding the effects of fasting, fast-mimicking diet, ketogenic diet, vegan diet, alkaline diet, paleolithic diet, the Gerson regimen, and macrobiotic diet in the context of cancer treatments. Clinical trials on dietary regimes as complementary cancer therapy are limited by significant differences in trial design, patient characteristics, and cancer type, making it difficult to draw conclusions. In the future, more uniformly controlled clinical trials should help to better define the role of diets in cancer management.",

The Hunter-Gatherer Model was designed to offset the apparent mismatch between our genes and the current Western-type lifestyle, a mismatch that arguably affects prevalence of many chronic degenerative diseases. The effort has always been controversial and subject to both scientific and popular critiques. The present article (1) addresses eight such challenges, presenting for each how the model has been modified in response, or how the criticism can be rebutted; (2) reviews new epidemiological and experimental evidence (including especially randomized controlled clinical trials); and (3) shows how official recommendations put forth by governments and health authorities have converged toward the model. Such convergence suggests that evolutionary anthropology can make significant contributions to human health.",

      "title": "A Clinical Perspective of Low Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diets: A Narrative Review.",
      "abstract": "Low carbohydrates diets (LCDs), which provide 20-120 g of carbohydrates per day, have long been used as therapeutic options in the treatment of severe obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and other morbid conditions, with good results in terms of weight loss and control of the main metabolic parameters, at least in the short and medium term. According to the caloric content and the macronutrient composition, we can classify LCDs in hypocaloric, normoproteic diets [such as the Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD) or the protein-sparing modified fasting (PSMF)], hypocaloric, hyperproteic and hyperlipidic diets (e.g., Atkins, Paleo diets…) and normocaloric, normo-/hyperproteic diets (eucaloric KD), the latter mainly used in patients with brain tumors (gliomas) and refractory epilepsy. In addition to LCD diets, another interesting dietary approach which gained attention in the last few decades is fasting and its beneficial effects in terms of modulation of metabolic pathways, cellular processes and hormonal secretions. Due to the impossibility of using fasting regimens for long periods of time, several alternative strategies have been proposed that can mimic the effects, including calorie restriction, intermittent or alternating fasting, and the so-called fasting mimicking diets (FMDs). Recent preclinical studies have shown positive effects of FMDs in various experimental models of tumors, diabetes, Alzheimer Disease, and other morbid conditions, but to date, the scientific evidence in humans is limited to some opens studies and case reports. The purpose of our narrative review is to offer an overview of the characteristics of the main dietary regimens applied in the treatment of different clinical conditions as well as of the scientific evidence that justifies their use, focusing on low and zero-carb diets and on the different types of fasting.",

      "abstract": "The site of Riparo Broion (Vicenza, northeastern Italy) preserves a stratigraphic sequence documenting the Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic transition, in particular the final Mousterian and the Uluzzian cultures. In 2018, a human tooth was retrieved from a late Mousterian level, representing the first human remain ever found from this rock shelter (Riparo Broion 1). Here, we provide the morphological description and taxonomic assessment of Riparo Broion 1 with the support of classic and virtual morphology, 2D and 3D analysis of the topography of enamel thickness, and DNA analysis. The tooth is an exfoliated right upper deciduous canine, and its general morphology and enamel thickness distribution support attribution to a Neanderthal child. Correspondingly, the mitochondrial DNA sequence from Riparo Broion 1 falls within the known genetic variation of Late Pleistocene Neanderthals, in accordance with newly obtained radiocarbon dates that point to approximately 48 ka cal BP as the most likely minimum age for this specimen. The present work describes novel and direct evidence of the late Neanderthal occupation in northern Italy that preceded the marked cultural and technological shift documented by the Uluzzian layers in the archaeological sequence at Riparo Broion. Here, we provide a new full morphological, morphometric, and taxonomic analysis of Riparo Broion 1, in addition to generating the wider reference sample of Neanderthal and modern human upper deciduous canines. This research contributes to increasing the sample of fossil remains from Italy, as well as the number of currently available upper deciduous canines, which are presently poorly documented in the scientific literature.",

      "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed a putative relationship between diet and glioma development and prognosis, but few studies have examined the association between overall diet and glioma risk. This study, conducted in China, employed a hospital-based case-control approach. The researchers utilized an a priori method based on dietary data to evaluate compliance scores for five healthy dietary patterns (the Mediterranean diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the Mediterranean-DASH diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet, the Paleolithic diet, and the Planetary Health Diet) in 1012 participants. At the same time, data-driven methods were used to explore the association between dietary patterns and glioma via principal component analysis (PCA). In the multivariate model, adhering to the Mediterranean diet (odds ratio (OR) = 0.29; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.17-0.52), the DASH diet (OR = 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04-0.18), the MIND diet (OR = 0.25; 95% CI: 0.14-0.44), and the Paleolithic diet (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.06-0.25) was associated with a reduced glioma risk. The results of PCA suggested that increasing the intake of plant-based foods and fish and limiting foods rich in carbohydrates, fats, and salts were associated with a reduced glioma risk. There was a substantial nonlinear dose-response association between glioma and the Mediterranean diet score. However, the DASH diet score, the MIND diet score, and the Paleolithic diet score exhibited linear dose-response relationships. Therefore, this study finds that dietary patterns may be an influencing factor for glioma risk.",

      "abstract": "Nutritional approach has been intensely investigated in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, but, despite many sparse reports, at present, there is not a universally accepted specific diet. In fact, nutritional requirements and, therefore, the ideal diet, may vary according to disease type, extension and activity. Among nutritional related issue in IBD, obesity has become a relevant one. In fact, obesity and IBD are both increasing in prevalence in last decades, and more and more IBD patients are overweight or obese. These two conditions present common metabolic pathways, leading to dysbiosis and mucosal barrier dysfunction, but the real clinical relationship and the potential reciprocal relative influences are not clear. In order to control weight, many IBD patients follow different weight loss diets, often without any specialized medical advice. Among those, low carb, intermittent fasting, paleolithic, and low-fat diets are some of the most popular, and plant based and Mediterranean diet, even though they are not just strictly weight loss diets, are followed by many IBD patients even for weight control. All the diets mentioned above have been effectively associated with weight loss, reduction in waist circumference and body mass index. However, there are still conflicting data regarding safety in IBD patients and potential experimental and clinical anti-inflammatory effect. In the present review, we described potential relations between obesity and IBD, and we analysed available evidence on efficacy and safety of weight loss diets in IBD patients, in order to provide a practical guide to physicians.",

      "abstract": "Understanding chronic kidney disease (CKD) through the lens of evolutionary biology highlights the mismatch between our Paleolithic-optimized genes and modern diets, which led to the dramatically increased prevalence of CKD in modern societies. In particular, the Standard American Diet (SAD), high in carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods, causes conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic inflammation, and hypertension, leading to CKD. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a genetic form of CKD, is characterized by progressive renal cystogenesis that leads to renal failure. This review challenges the fatalistic view of ADPKD as solely a genetic disease. We argue that, just like non-genetic CKD, modern dietary practices, lifestyle, and environmental exposures initiate and accelerate ADPKD progression. Evidence shows that carbohydrate overconsumption, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance significantly impact renal health. Additionally, factors like dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, nephrotoxin exposure, gastrointestinal dysbiosis, and renal microcrystal formation exacerbate ADPKD. Conversely, carbohydrate restriction, ketogenic metabolic therapy (KMT), and antagonizing the lithogenic risk show promise in slowing ADPKD progression. Addressing disease triggers through dietary modifications and lifestyle changes offers a conservative, non-pharmacological strategy for disease modification in ADPKD. This comprehensive review underscores the urgency of integrating diet and lifestyle factors into the clinical management of ADPKD to mitigate disease progression, improve patient outcomes, and offer therapeutic choices that can be implemented worldwide at low or no cost to healthcare payers and patients.",

      "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most predominant malignancy in Arab women in the Middle East, and yearly increases in occurrence by 37.5 and mortality rates by 15.2 for every 100,000 in 2019. This review explores the gap in research investigating the role of dietary patterns and BC in Middle Eastern countries. Furthermore, we analyze the evidence connecting these patterns to BC prevalence in the region, discussing implications for public health and preventive strategies. PubMed, ProQuest, and Cochrane databases were searched up to November 2023. Articles published in English from 2000 to 2023 were identified. Our search included dietary patterns (DP), their association with BC and specific to Middle Eastern Regions. The majority of existing research is concentrated in Iran, with limited illustration from Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Jordan, and a notable absence of studies from other Middle Eastern countries. We found that dietary intervention is closely related to the occurrence, development, and prognosis of BC. Most DPs such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, Mediterranean, Plant-based and Paleolithic diets are identified to decrease the probability of BC by being rich sources of fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins and minerals. However, there are few DPs that increase the risk of BC, because of the existence of foods such as unhealthy fats, low fiber, sugars, and fried foods in those patterns which contribute to increasing the risk factors associated with BC. This review highlights the intricate connection between DPs and the risk of BC in the Middle East, revealing potential protective effects and heightened risks linked to specific dietary elements.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is the most well-known and researched dietary pattern worldwide. It is characterized by the consumption of a wide variety of foods, such as extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), legumes, cereals, nuts, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish, and wine. Many of these foods provide several phytonutrients, among which polyphenols and vitamins play an important role. Data from several studies have strongly established that nutrition is a key factor in promoting a healthy lifestyle and preventing many chronic diseases. In particular, a large number of studies have established the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against several chronic diseases, among which are diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, aging disorders, and against overall mortality. Animal and human translational studies have revealed the biological mechanisms regulating the beneficial effects of the traditional Mediterranean diet. Indeed, several studies demonstrated that this nutritional pattern has lipid-lowering, anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-oxidative effects. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet is considered environmentally sustainable. In this review, we describe the composition of the Mediterranean diet, assess its beneficial effects, and analyze their epigenomic, genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic aspects. In the future it will be important to continue exploring the molecular mechanisms through which the Mediterranean diet exerts its protective effects and to standardize its components and serving sizes to understand more precisely its effects on human health.",

A long life is a dream of humans since the beginning of time but also a dream is to live it in good physical and mental condition. Nutrition research has focused on recent decades more on food combination patterns than on individual foods/nutrients due to the possible synergistic/antagonistic effects of the components in a dietary model. Various dietary patterns have been associated with health benefits, but the largest body of evidence in the literature is attributable to the traditional dietary habits and lifestyle followed by populations from the Mediterranean region. After the Seven Countries Study, many prospective observational studies and trials in diverse populations reinforced the beneficial effects associated with a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in reference to the prevention/management of age-associated non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, depression, respiratory diseases, and fragility fractures. In addition, the Mediterranean diet is ecologically sustainable. Therefore, this immaterial world heritage constitutes a healthy way of eating and living respecting the environment.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet proved to be one of the healthiest diets in the word. It has several beneficial effects and it prevents many non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity. Before being a culinary regime, the Mediterranean diet is characterized by specific cultural heritages and traditions, also influencing the lifestyle of the populations. The Mediterranean diet follows the so-called food pyramid, comprising several food combinations. Indeed, it is mainly composed by vegetables, fish and dairy products, while red meat and sweets are poorly consumed. Processed foods are mainly avoided, apart from lacto-fermented ones, the first processed foods consumed by humans. Food fermentation by microorganisms not only improves the functionality of bioactive metabolites, but also increases the shelf life and organoleptic properties of the food. Lactic acid bacteria play a vital role in transforming the food constituents, thereby enhancing their nutritional and functional properties. In addition, these foods introduce beneficial bacteria into gut microbiota, thus maintaining a healthy gut microbiome and corresponding gut-brain axis, thus providing an overall improvement in health and a reduced risk of non-communicable diseases and metabolic disorders. This review will focus on the Mediterranean diet, on its characterising food pyramid and food combinations, and on lacto-fermented foods, one of the components of the Mediterranean diet with the most beneficial effects.",

      "abstract": "It has been established, worldwide, that non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular events account for a high percentage of morbidity and mortality in contemporary societies. Several modifiable risk factors, such as sedentary activities, sleep deprivation, smoking, and unhealthy dietary habits have contributed to this increase. Healthy nutrition in terms of adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in fruits, legumes, vegetables, olive oil, herbs, spices, and high fiber intake may contribute to the decrease in this pandemic. The beneficial effects of the MD can be mainly attributed to its numerous components rich in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, the MD may further contribute to the improvement of reproductive health, modify the risk for neurodegenerative diseases, and protect against depression and psychosocial maladjustment. There is also evidence highlighting the impact of healthy nutrition in female people on the composition of the gut microbiota and future metabolic and overall health of their offspring. It is therefore important to highlight the beneficial effects of the MD on metabolic, reproductive, and mental health, while shaping the overall health of future generations. The beneficial effects of MD can be further enhanced by increased physical activity in the context of a well-balanced healthy lifestyle.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is one of the main noncommunicable diseases in terms of health impact. Factors such as a progressively aging population point to future increases in the incidence of cancer on a global level. The elevated number of affected individuals, together with continuous improvements in cancer prevention and therapy, is creating a growing population of cancer survivors, with often inadequately met needs. Lifestyle is a key modulator of cancer risk and of associated morbidity and mortality, and is included in all approaches to the long-term management of cancer. Diet is a principal component of lifestyle, and most of the available evidence is centered on the Mediterranean diet. Our objective was to provide a narrative review of the evidence on the effect of the Mediterranean diet on cancer risk and health threats related to cancer survivorship. For this purpose, we searched the PubMed database for articles published between January 1, 2000, and June 12, 2023. Current data show that the Mediterranean diet is inversely associated with risk, or is risk neutral, for most types of cancer. Tumors of the digestive system have received preferential interest, but studies have also been published on tumors in other organs. The evidence, however, is meager due to the observational nature of most studies, although it is reassuring that benefit is reproduced in studies performed in different populations and environments. Evidence related to cancer survivors is limited by the paucity of studies, yet several findings regarding survival, recurrence, and short- and long-term morbidity suggest a potential role for the Mediterranean diet that warrants further research.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is a plant-based, antioxidant-rich, unsaturated fat dietary pattern that has been consistently associated with lower rates of noncommunicable diseases and total mortality, so that it is considered one of the healthiest dietary patterns. Clinical trials and mechanistic studies have demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet and its peculiar foods and nutrients exert beneficial effects against inflammation, oxidative stress, dysmetabolism, vascular dysfunction, adiposity, senescence, cognitive decline, neurodegeneration, and tumorigenesis, thus preventing age-associated chronic diseases and improving wellbeing and health. Nocturnal sleep is an essential physiological function, whose alteration is associated with health outcomes and chronic diseases. Scientific evidence suggests that diet and sleep are related in a bidirectional relationship, and the understanding of this association is important given their role in disease prevention. In this review, we surveyed the literature concerning the current state of evidence from epidemiological studies on the impact of the Mediterranean diet on nighttime sleep quantity and quality. The available studies indicate that greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with adequate sleep duration and with several indicators of better sleep quality. Potential mechanisms mediating the effect of the Mediterranean diet and its foods and nutrients on sleep are described, and gap-in-knowledge and new research agenda to corroborate findings are discussed.",

The management and prevention of osteoporosis and related low energy fractures start with a correct lifestyle and proper nutrition. Several different nutrients are essential for bone and mineral metabolism, especially calcium.

A prospective observational study in a population of two hundred peri- and post-menopausal women (aged 30-80 years) was developed at Careggi hospital, Florence. Both MD adherence and dietary calcium intake were evaluated in occasion of a \"first visit\" and a \"follow-up\" visit, through validated questionnaires. From a descriptive point of view, although not statistically significant, in both visits a slight increase in calcium intake was observed for high adherence to MD diet. Moreover, a short nutritional interview (20 min) was applied in our population and demonstrated to be sufficient to significantly improve MD adherence level (mean score at T",

Randomized clinical trials have been designed to demonstrate those lifestyle modifications can change the pattern of chronic diseases development and progression. Among these, nutrition is one of the most impacting factors. Therefore, nutrition and diets were also included in different randomized clinical trials, and most of them showed a favorable impact of nutrition modification on the participant's health. Nevertheless, study designs were considerably different, and future studies are needed to support nutrition modifications further. The choice of a healthy considered diet, like the Mediterranean diet, was shown to impact chronic diseases, cardiovascular risk, and adult life expectancy mainly due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Furthermore, a high intake of fibers, fruits, and vegetables together with a low intake of fat and energy-dense, processed foods contribute to an inflammation reduction and a more robust immune system leading. Besides these well-known properties, all lifestyle modifications must be personalized according to the availability of foods, geographic localizations, and the healthy status of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Ketogenic Diet is a nutritional pattern often used as dietotherapy in inflammatory diseases, including neurological disorders. Applied on epileptic children since 1920, in recent years it has been taken into account again as a tool to both reduce inflammatory burdens and ameliorate the nutritional status of patients affected by different pathologies. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered an immune-mediated neuro-inflammatory disease and diet is a possible factor in its pathogenesis. The aim of this work is to investigate the main potential targets of MS-related impairments, in particular the cognitive deficits, focusing on the alteration of biomarkers such as the Brain Derived-Neurotrophic Factor and the Tryptophan/Kynurenine ratio that could play a role on neuroprotection and thus on MS progression. Furthermore, we here propose nutritional suggestions which are useful in the development of a ketogenic diet protocol that takes advantage of the anti-inflammatory properties of low-carbohydrate foods from the Mediterranean diet to be applied to subjects with MS. In conclusion, this approach will allow one to develop the ketogenic diet combined with a modified Mediterranean diet as a possible tool to improve neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis.",

      "abstract": "Lifestyle improvement is a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease prevention and has a relevant effect on blood pressure control. During the last decades the attention of the researcher has focused on low-salt diets as the lifestyle modification most effective in blood pressure reduction. Current international guidelines thus suggest to stress the importance of the implementation of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet and of a low-salt Mediterranean diet to achieve the best results in term of blood pressure decrease. However, salt reduction in diet could be not the only nor the main determinant of blood pressure reduction under dietary treatment. DASH and low-salt Mediterranean diet are also characterized by a high intake of vegetables (NO and polyphenol sources), whole grains, some low-fat dairy products, and low intake of red meat, sugar, and trans-hydrogenated fats. Lacto-ovo vegetarian diet are also per se associated to a significant improvement in blood pressure levels. Moreover, these diets are particularly effective when associated with a significant weight loss. Furthermore, blood pressure can also be lowered by some nutraceuticals (beetroot, magnesium, vitamin C, catechin-rich beverages, lycopene, etc). The aim of this narrative review is to critically resume the most recent evidence supporting a complete approach to dietary counseling for hypertension prevention and management.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet has gained significant attention for its potential health benefits on diverse pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA), a prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by cartilage breakdown and inflammation. Numerous observational studies have suggested that adherence to the Mediterranean diet, may have protective effects against OA. The abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds and omega-3 fatty acids, among the Mediterranean diet components is believed to contribute to its beneficial effects on OA. Research investigating the association between the Mediterranean diet and OA has shown promising results. Several observational studies have reported that adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with a reduced risk of developing OA and with lower severity of OA symptoms. Additionally, intervention studies have demonstrated improvements in pain, function, and quality of life among OA patients following a Mediterranean diet intervention. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests potential mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the Mediterranean diet against OA, including its ability to reduce inflammation, oxidative stress, and cartilage degradation. However, further well-designed randomized controlled trials and mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms and establish causality. In conclusion, the Mediterranean diet appears to be a promising dietary approach for the prevention and management of OA. Its rich array of nutrients and bioactive compounds may exert protective effects against OA development and progression, although more research is warranted to confirm these findings and elucidate underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet is a dietary regime derived from the one followed by the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by many healthy constituents, among which are cereals, legumes, fruits, vegetables, olives, and white meat. Many studies suggest that this dietary regime is the key to obtaining a healthy and long life, like that of the Mediterranean peoples. Despite its popularity among health professionals, this diet is still confined to a certain geographical area of the world. Due to globalization and the modern busy lifestyle, this cultural diet is losing ground even in its home region, with more and more people embracing the so-called Western diet. An awareness of health benefits of the individual components of the Mediterranean diet will therefore draw attention from all over the world to this healthy and affordable dietary pattern, which can not only improve the overall health, but also reduce the risk of developing chronic and infectious diseases. In this regard, garlic and Mediterranean legumes present a huge repertoire of phytochemicals having both nutritive and nutraceutical properties, which therefore should be included in our daily dietary routines in moderate proportions. This narrative review aims at summarizing the principal components and health benefits of the Mediterranean diet, in particular of garlic and legumes.",

      "abstract": "Fruit and vegetables are excellent sources of health-promoting bioactive compounds and nutraceuticals. Regular consumption of fruit and vegetables helps prevent the onset and progression of many non-communicable diseases. The Mediterranean diet envisages consumption of healthy vegetables and fruit on a daily basis for maximum health benefits. Traditional use envisages vegetable-based and fruit-based diets, and many studies scientifically proved the beneficial effects of Mediterranean vegetables and fruits. Rich in bioactive phytochemicals, citrus, cucumbers and grapes have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, cardioprotective, anti-ageing and anti-cancer properties. Studies indicate that intake of citrus, cucumbers and grapes reduces hypertension, hyperlipidemia, skin problems and infections and improves the health of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. These beneficial effects are mediated by several bioactive molecules present in Mediterranean diet vegetables and fruits, such as citrus, cucumbers and grapes. Indeed, they contains flavones, isoflavones, tannins, polyphenols and many beneficial natural molecules. This review focuses on the bioactive ingredients in citrus fruit, cucumbers and grapes, all components of the Mediterranean diet, and their health effects. A deep understanding of Mediterranean diet's components, as well as clinical trials to test natural molecules beneficial effects, will permit to further explore the therapeutic potential of the Mediterranean diet in several pathological conditions.",

      "abstract": "The adoption of healthy and sustainable diets and the transition to sustainable food systems is of principal importance in order to counteract the double burden of climate change and noncommunicable diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MD) has been widely recognized as a biodiversity and healthy nutrition resource to support sustainable development and food security. This study explored biodiversity in terms of food plants species, subspecies, varieties, and races, and also addressed food plant diversity differences between the MD and Western-type consumption patterns. It was funded by the EU BioValue Project, aiming to promote the integration of underutilized crops into the food value chains. Using a 2-stage scheme, data were selected from MEDUSA and Euro+Med databases (including 449 species, 2366 subspecies, varieties, and races). Furthermore, 12 countries from North Africa and Europe were classified in 2 groups according to their subregional attributes and their traditionally most prevalent dietary pattern (MD or Western-type diets). Statistical analysis showed that the mean of the majorly cultivated food plants in the MD was significantly higher than its counterpart in the Western diet. Furthermore, no statistical difference was detected in the averages of native food plants between the MD group and the Western diet group, implying that the higher diversity in food plants observed in the MD seems to be attributed to crop utilization rather than crop availability. Our findings indicated the interlinkage between biodiversity and prevailing dietary patterns and further underlined that biodiversity could constitute a prerequisite for dietary diversity and hence nutrition security. In addition, this study demonstrated that diets and nutrition should be approached in a broader way within the context of both agro-food and ecological systems.",

      "abstract": "The interest in the Mediterranean diet has grown considerably due to its potential health benefits on the prevention of diverse age-related chronic diseases and its association with longevity. This dietary pattern, considered among the healthiest in the world, is not simply a combination of healthy foods but goes further in its historical and cultural roots. Mediterranean diet is not intrinsically tied to any specific religion or spiritual system, but its cultural and geographical context has influenced the dietary practices of its inhabitants, encompassing the history of Western civilization and of the three Monotheistic religions Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. These religions may have some impact on dietary choices due to religious customs and practices. In 2010 the Mediterranean diet was inscribed on the UNESCO's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, highlighting it as a social and cultural expression of the different food cultures of the Mediterranean region and indicating that the importance of this dietary and lifestyle pattern lies not only in its specific foods and nutrients, but in the way in which its characteristic foods are produced, cooked, and eaten. In this narrative review we will discuss the possible connections between the main religions originated in the Mediterranean basin and their influence on the composition of the Mediterranean diet, and the links between spirituality/religion and this dietary pattern. This traditional model can represent a form of conscious healthy eating and lifestyle in contrast to the unhealthy Western lifestyle and ultra-processed food consumption widespread throughout the world.",

      "abstract": "The traditional Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), rich in minimally processed plant foods and fish, has been widely recognized to be one of the healthiest diets. Data from multiple randomized clinical trials have demonstrated its powerful effect against oxidative stress, inflammation and the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic conditions that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. The protecting effects of the MedDiet against cognitive decline have been investigated in several observational and experimental studies. Data from observational studies suggest that the MedDiet may represent an effective dietary strategy for the early prevention of dementia, although these findings require further substantiation in clinical trials which have so far produced inconclusive results. Moreover, as we discuss in this review, accumulating data emphasizes the importance of: 1) maintaining an optimal nutritional and metabolic status for the promotion of healthy cognitive aging, and 2) implementing cognition-sparing dietary and lifestyle interventions during early time-sensitive windows before the pathological cascades turn into an irreversible state. In summary, components of the MedDiet pattern, such as essential fatty acids, polyphenols and vitamins, have been associated with reduced oxidative stress and the current evidence from observational studies seems to assign to the MedDiet a beneficial role in promoting brain health; however, results from clinical trials have been inconsistent. While we advocate for longitudinal analyses and for larger and longer clinical trials to be conducted, we assert our interim support to the use of the MedDiet as a protective dietary intervention for cognitive function based on its proven cardiovascular and metabolic benefits.",

      "abstract": "Scientific evidence suggests a relation between dietary factors and sleep. Several studies show that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is associated with better sleep quality, but the relation with chronotype has been only recently explored. The aim of this study was to better understand the relation between chronotype and Mediterranean diet adherence. For this purpose, an analysis of 1936 adults (age 18-90 y) living in Italy was performed to investigate the association between chronotype (assessed with a short form of the morningness-eveningness questionnaire) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet (assessed through a 110-item food frequency questionnaire and the Medi-Lite literature-based Mediterranean adherence score). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) describing the association between chronotypes and high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (>14 points). Moreover, a systematic review of other observational studies published so far was performed. Individuals reporting having intermediate (n = 614) and evening (n = 173) chronotypes were less likely to have high adherence to the Mediterranean diet compared to morning chronotype (OR = 0.28, 95 % CI: 0.18, 0.42 and OR = 0.08, 95 % CI: 0.03, 0.27, respectively). When the analysis was conducted in subgroups of age, the results were similar in mid-age (>50 y) participants (for intermediate and evening chronotypes, OR = 0.21, 95 % CI: 0.10, 0.43 and OR = 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.01, 0.69, respectively) while the association with high adherence to the Mediterranean diet of evening compared to morning chronotype lost significance in older (>60 y) participants (for intermediate and evening chronotypes, OR = 0.27, 95 % CI: 0.09, 0.82 and OR = 0.22, 95 % CI: 0.02, 1.92, respectively). Out of 10 studies (date range of publication 2020-2022) included in the systematic review, there was a general consistence of findings showing higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet among morning chronotypes, although few studies reported null results. In conclusion, current evidence suggests that an intermediate and evening chronotype could be associated with lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet, but the association could be modified by other factors when considering older individuals.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in minimally processed plant foods and in monounsaturated fats but low in saturated fats, meat, and dairy products, represents one of the most studied diets for cardiovascular health. It has been shown, from both observational and randomized controlled trials, that MD reduces body weight, improves cardiovascular disease surrogates such as waist-to-hip ratios, lipids, and inflammation markers, and even prevents the development of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and other diseases. However, it is unclear whether it offers cardiovascular benefits from its individual components or as a whole. Furthermore, limitations in the methodology of studies and meta-analyses have raised some concerns over its potential cardiovascular benefits. MD is also associated with characteristic changes in the intestinal microbiota, mediated through its constituents. These include increased growth of species producing short-chain fatty acids, such as ",

      "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and is interrelated to stroke, heart attack, and heart failure. The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) has been closely associated with reduced CVD morbidity and mortality, but research is not well explored for this relationship in individuals with diabetes (who experience greater CVD morbidity and mortality than individuals without diabetes). The aim of this review was to explore the literature related to the MedDiet and atherosclerosis and associated risk factors in individuals with and without diabetes. In total, 570 articles were identified, and 36 articles were included. The articles were published between 2011 and 2021. Platforms used for the search were PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Our literature search included clinical and observational studies. Clinical studies revealed the MedDiet was associated with improved biomarkers, plaque, and anthropometric measurements that are associated with atherosclerosis and CVD. Observational studies identified associations between the MedDiet and lower presence of atherosclerosis, improved vascular aging, and increased endothelial progenitor cells. However, most of the studies took place in Mediterranean countries. Further research is needed to better understand the long-term effects the MedDiet on atherosclerosis and its associated risk factors in diverse populations to include individuals with and without diabetes.",

      "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MedD) is a flexible dietary pattern which has such variability that has led to inconsistencies in definitions and assessment. The purpose of this narrative review is to evaluate scoring systems in a cultural and geographic context, from Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean countries, for comparison and application. The early MedD scoring systems (i.e. Trichopoulou's MedD Scale (T-MDS) and alternative MedD Scale (aMed)) are widely applied throughout the world but use population-specific median cut-offs which limit interpretation and cross-study comparisons. The T-MDS and aMed also do not account for non-traditional MedD foods which are consumed in greater quantities than when the scoring systems were developed. Scoring systems developed after the MedD pyramid publication in 2011 have generally used these recommendations as a basis for food group intake cut-offs, incorporating more foods/food groups as negative components, and some have included dietary and lifestyle behaviours. The different approaches to MedD assessment have created much variability in the foods/food group components included in scoring systems. Assessments that include dietary and lifestyle behaviours may reflect the nutrition transition occurring in Mediterranean countries and better guide clinical intervention approaches. While the new scoring systems are theorised to better capture MedD adherence and behaviours, comparisons are sparse in the literature and none exists outside of Europe. Consensus on food and dietary behaviours to include as well as the methodology for assigning points in MedD scoring systems is needed to advance our understanding of MedD and health relationships to promote public health messaging and clinical application.",

      "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death among women all over the world. Female tissue-specific cancers are the most commonly diagnosed among women and account for most cancer-related deaths. The main risk factors for women's cancer are hereditary factors, specific exposure to dangerous chemicals, disorders such as hormone imbalance, and lifestyle. High body mass index, low physical activity, low intake of fruit and vegetables, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of cancer screening and treatment are the most common risk factors. Nutrigenetics and nutrigenomics are both part of nutritional genomics. Nutrigenetics is how a person's body reacts to nutrients based on his/her genotype. It can be used to create a personalized diet, maintain a person's health, avoid disease, and if necessary to sustain therapy. Nutrigenomics studies the impact of nutrition on gene expression and the epigenomic, proteomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic effects of dietary intake. There is evidence that diet matters for different women's cancers, and is related to cancer progression, survival and treatment. The optimum combination for cancer prevention is a diet rich in vitamins and fibre, with low meat consumption, low milk intake and moderate use of alcohol. The Mediterranean diet looks to be an optimal diet with a good nutrition pattern, qualifying it as a therapy to prescribe.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the article is to examine side effects of increased dietary intake of amino acids, which are commonly used as a dietary supplement. In addition to toxicity, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, attention is focused on renal and gastrointestinal tract functions, ammonia production, and consequences of a competition with other amino acids for a carrier at the cell membranes and enzymes responsible for their degradation. In alphabetic order are examined arginine, beta-alanine, branched-chain amino acids, carnosine, citrulline, creatine, glutamine, histidine, beta -hydroxy- beta -methylbutyrate, leucine, and tryptophan. In the article is shown that enhanced intake of most amino acid supplements may not be risk-free and can cause a number of detrimental side effects. Further research is necessary to elucidate effects of high doses and long-term consumption of amino acid supplements on immune system, brain function, muscle protein balance, synthesis of toxic metabolites, and tumor growth and examine their suitability under certain circumstances. These include elderly, childhood, pregnancy, nursing a baby, and medical condition, such as diabetes and liver disease. Studies are also needed to examine adaptive response to a long-term intake of any substance and consequences of discontinuation of supplementation.",

      "title": "Over the Counter Supplements for Memory: A Review of Available Evidence.",
      "abstract": "In 2021, the Global Brain Health Supplement Industry Market size was valued at US$7.6 billion. It is predicted to increase to US$15.59 billion by 2030. Memory and its enhancement are a segment of the market that comprised the highest global revenue share in 2021. In the USA alone, dietary supplement sales reached US$18 billion in 2018. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have the authority to approve dietary supplements' safety, effectiveness, or labeling before products go on the market. The FDA often does not even review supplements before they go to market. Supplement manufacturers are thus responsible for ensuring their products are safe and that their claims are truthful. An extensive review of current supplements on the market was performed by surveying memory products for sale at local and national pharmacies and grocery stores. A list of 103 supplements was compiled and the ingredients in these memory supplements were reviewed. The 18 most common ingredients in these supplements were identified. Each of the supplements included at least one of the 18 most common ingredients. Scientific data relative to these ingredients and their effect on memory was searched using PubMed and Cochrane library databases. Currently, there is no compelling evidence for use of apoaequorin, coenzyme Q10, coffee extracts, L-theanine, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B6, vitamin B9, or vitamin B12 supplementation for memory. On the other hand, there is some current evidence for memory benefit from supplementation with ashwagandha, choline, curcumin, ginger, Lion's Mane, polyphenols, phosphatidylserine, and turmeric. There are current studies with mixed results regarding the benefit of carnitine, gingko biloba, Huperzine A, vitamin D, and vitamin E supplementation for memory. Dietary supplements geared toward improving cognition are a billion-dollar industry that continues to grow despite lacking a solid scientific foundation for their marketing claims. More rigorous studies are needed relative to the long-term use of these supplements in homogenous populations with standardized measurements of cognition. Health care providers need to be aware of any and all supplements their older adult patients may be consuming and be educated about their side effects and interactions with prescription medications. Lastly, the FDA needs to take an active position relative to monitoring marketed supplements regarding safety, purity and claims of efficacy.",

      "abstract": "Recent estimates for the global brain health supplement category, i.e. nootropic market size, will grow to nearly $5.8 billion by 2023. Overall, nearly one-quarter (23%) of adults currently take a supplement to maintain or improve brain health or delay and reverse dementia. Not surprisingly, the use of such supplements increases with age - more than one-third of the oldest generation (ages 74 and older) takes a supplement for brain health. This widespread use is being driven by a strong desire both in the younger and older generations to enhance cognitive performance and achieve healthy aging. The most prevalent botanicals currently dominating the nootropic marketplace include Gingko biloba, American ginseng, and Bacopa monnieri. However, other botanicals that affect stress, focus, attention, and sleep have also been procured by dietary supplement companies developing products for improving both, short and long-term brain health. This review focuses on efficacy data for neuroactive botanicals targeted at improving cognitive function, stress reduction, memory, mood, attention, concentration, focus, and alertness, including Bacopa monnieri, Ginkgo biloba, Holy basil, American ginseng, Gotu kola, Lemon balm, Common and Spanish sages and spearmint. Botanicals are discussed in terms of available clinical efficacy data and current safety profiles. Data gaps are highlighted for both efficacy and safety to bring attention to unmet needs and future research.",

      "title": "Select Dietary Supplement Ingredients for Preserving and Protecting the Immune System in Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Immune health products represent approximately 10% of all US dietary supplement sales. Claims made on products to support or boost the immune system are attractive to the otherwise healthy consumer who may or may not be experiencing certain life stressors. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the purported benefits and/or potential harms of select dietary supplement ingredients frequently listed on the labels of products having immune health or related market claims. With a focus on resilience, research questions were related to whether dietary supplement ingredients are efficacious in preserving and protecting immune health in healthy individuals; and when faced with a stressor, whether taking a supplement prophylactically can assist in maintaining health and resisting or bouncing back more quickly. Thirty-nine randomized controlled studies involving populations including children, adults and seniors exposed to stressors, such as air travel, intense exercise, academic stress, and/or exposure to winter weather, met eligibility criteria. The studies included eight of the 27 supplement ingredients identified through a market-driven scoping review. Those ingredients used in single ingredient products were echinacea, elderberry, garlic, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc. Whereas some studies may point to evidence for benefit, specific gaps preclude the authors from making firm statements with regard to the overall evidence-base for these products and ingredients and in answering the research questions. As we move toward a vision of health promotion and resilience rather than a sole focus on disease prevention and treatment, further work in this area of dietary supplements is of utmost importance.",

      "abstract": "Vitamins and minerals are of fundamental importance to numerous human functions that are essential to optimise athlete performance. Athletes incur a high turnover of key vitamins and minerals and are therefore dependent on sufficient energy intake to replenish nutrient stores. However, many athletes are poor at servicing their energy replenishment needs, especially female athletes, and although a 'food first approach' to meeting nutrient requirements is the primary goal, it may be important for some athletes to consider a vitamin and/or mineral supplement to meet their daily needs. When working to determine if an athlete requires vitamin or mineral supplements, practitioners should use a robust framework to assess the overall energy requirements, current dietary practices and the biological and clinical status of their athletes. Of note, any supplementation plan should account for the various factors that may impact the efficacy of the approach (e.g. athlete sex, the nutrient recommended dietary intake, supplement dose/timing, co-consumption of other foods and any food-drug interactions). Importantly, there are numerous vitamins and minerals of key importance to athletes, each having specific relevance to certain situations (e.g. iron and B vitamins are significant contributors to haematological adaptation, calcium and vitamin D are important to bone health and folate is important in the female athlete); therefore, the appropriate supplement for a given situation should be carefully considered and consumed with the goal to augment an athlete's diet.",

They follow a relevant food regime and take specific dietary supplements, which is essential for the better recovery between trainings and competitions. However, the use of \"nonprohibited\" dietary supplements (DS) is not always completely safe.

      "abstract": "The global market for nutritional supplements (NS) is growing rapidly, and the use of L-arginine (Arg), L-citrulline (Cit), and citrulline malate (CitMal) supplements has been shown to enhance cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Over the past decade, Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements have received considerable attention from researchers in the field of exercise nutrition, who have investigated their potential effects on hemodynamic function, endothelial function, aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, and endurance. Previous studies were reviewed to determine the potential impact of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and exercise performance. By synthesizing the existing literature, the study aimed to provide insight into the possible uses and limitations of these supplements for these purposes. The results showed that both recreational and trained athletes did not see improved physical performance or increased nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with 0.075 g or 6 g doses of Arg supplement per body weight. However, 2.4 to 6 g of Cit per day for 7 to 16 days of various NSs had a positive impact, increasing NO synthesis, enhancing athletic performance indicators, and reducing feelings of exertion. The effects of an 8 g acute dose of CitMal supplement were inconsistent, and more research is needed to determine its impact on muscle endurance performance. Based on the positive effects reported in previous studies, further testing is warranted in various populations that may benefit from nutritional supplements, including aerobic and anaerobic athletes, resistance-trained individuals, elderly people, and clinical populations, to determine the impact of different doses, timing of ingestion, and long-term and acute effects of Arg, Cit, and CitMal supplements on cardiovascular health and athletic performance.",

      "abstract": "Objective: to perform a systematic literature review to examine the effects of high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplementation on physical, mental, and energy outcomes in healthy and 'at-risk' (suboptimal nutritional status/subclinical symptoms at baseline) adult populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for relevant randomized controlled trials until January 2020. Results: overall, 136 publications were identified. In the seven randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies considered eligible for inclusion, supplementation in healthy populations predominantly showed improvements in perceived stress, physical stamina, concentration, and general mental health, and significant reductions in anxiety and improvements in self-reported vigour. However, not all of these outcomes were significant, and statistical correction for multiple outcomes was not commonly employed. Studies investigating brain mapping following supplementation indicated increased functional activity in brain regions related to processing of attention, executive control, and working memory during cognitive tasks. Conclusions: while there is certainly a need for further studies on the neurocognitive and physical benefits of micronutrient supplementation, this review provides generally supportive evidence for the benefits of a high-dose, B-complex multivitamin/mineral supplement in healthy and at-risk populations in terms of physical, mental, and energy outcomes.",

In the U.S., dietary intake of minerals is often below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), especially for iodine and magnesium, and 28% of women develop iron deficiency anemia during their third trimester. The goal of this paper is to propose evidence-based recommendations for the optimal level of prenatal supplementation for each mineral for most women in the United States. Overall, the evidence suggests that optimal mineral supplementation can significantly reduce a wide range of pregnancy complications (including anemia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, hyperthyroidism, miscarriage, and pre-eclampsia) and infant health problems (including anemia, asthma/wheeze, autism, cerebral palsy, hypothyroidism, intellectual disability, low birth weight, neural tube defects, preterm birth, rickets, and wheeze). An evaluation of 180 commercial prenatal supplements found that they varied widely in mineral content, often contained only a subset of essential minerals, and the levels were often below our recommendations. Therefore, there is a need to establish recommendations on the optimal level of mineral supplementation during pregnancy.",

During the past few decades, melatonin products have gained popularity primarily as a sleep aid, with a variety of product forms available for different age groups of consumers. Recent reports have highlighted a rise in melatonin ingestion among children reported to poison control centers. The increased use of melatonin-containing products, the diversity in product forms, and reported label discrepancies has emphasized the need for additional research to better understand the marketplace. This work aims to measure melatonin content in products sold as dietary supplements and marketed for children, evaluate method performance across different product categories, and determine if product form has an impact on melatonin stability.

      "abstract": "The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract hosts complex and dynamic populations of microorganisms (gut microbiota) in advantageous symbiosis with the host organism through sophisticated molecular cross-talk. The balance and diversification within microbial communities (eubiosis) are crucial for the immune and metabolic homeostasis of the host, as well as for inhibiting pathogen penetration. In contrast, compositional dysregulation of the microbiota (dysbiosis) is blamed for the determinism of numerous diseases. Although further advances in the so-called 'omics' disciplines are needed, dietary manipulation of the gut microbial ecosystem through biomodulators (prebiotics, probiotics, symbionts, and postbiotics) represents an intriguing target to stabilize and/or restore eubiosis. Recently, new approaches have been developed for the production of infant formulas supplemented with prebiotics (human milk oligosaccharides [HMOs], galacto-oligosaccharides [GOS], fructo-oligosaccharides [FOS]), probiotics, and postbiotics to obtain formulas that are nutritionally and biologically equivalent to human milk (closer to the reference).",

      "abstract": "The term \"food first\" has been widely accepted as the preferred strategy within sport nutrition, although there is no agreed definition of this and often limited consideration of the implications. We propose that food first should mean \"where practically possible, nutrient provision should come from whole foods and drinks rather than from isolated food components or dietary supplements.\" There are many reasons to commend a food first strategy, including the risk of supplement contamination resulting in anti-doping violations. However, a few supplements can enhance health and/or performance, and therefore a food only approach could be inappropriate. We propose six reasons why a food only approach may not always be optimal for athletes: (a) some nutrients are difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities in the diet, or may require excessive energy intake and/or consumption of other nutrients; (b) some nutrients are abundant only in foods athletes do not eat/like; (c) the nutrient content of some foods with established ergogenic benefits is highly variable; (d) concentrated doses of some nutrients are required to correct deficiencies and/or promote immune tolerance; (e) some foods may be difficult to consume immediately before, during or immediately after exercise; and (f) tested supplements could help where there are concerns about food hygiene or contamination. In these situations, it is acceptable for the athlete to consider sports supplements providing that a comprehensive risk minimization strategy is implemented. As a consequence, it is important to stress that the correct terminology should be \"food first but not always food only.\"",

      "abstract": "The human body, particularly the brain, requires energy, stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate. Energy metabolism during cellular respiration is dependent on the presence of multiple micronutrients, which act as essential components, coenzymes, or precursors at every stage. An adequate supply of multiple micronutrients is vital for efficient energy production. However, micronutrient intakes below the recommended dietary allowance are common, even in industrialized countries. Intakes of vitamins A, D, E, folate, iron, zinc, and selenium are suboptimal across all age groups. Suboptimal micronutrient levels have been shown to contribute to low energy levels, physical and mental fatigue, and impaired cognitive performance and wellbeing - symptoms frequently present in the general population. When supplemented in combination in well-conducted trials, multiple micronutrients ± coenzyme Q10 reduced oxidative stress in chronic fatigue syndrome; in healthy people they increased cerebral blood-flow hemodynamic response, energy expenditure, and fat oxidation; reduced mental and physical fatigue; improved the speed and accuracy of cognitive function during demanding tasks; and reduced stress. The results from these clinical trials suggest that even in industrialized countries, where adults might be assumed to have a healthy, balanced diet, there is a rationale to supplement with multiple micronutrients, including coenzyme Q10, to improve nutritional status, support energy metabolism, and improve subjective wellbeing.",

The WHO estimates the worldwide prevalence of 1.9 billion overweight adults and more than 650 million people with obesity. These alarming data highlight the high and growing prevalence of obesity and represent a risk factor for the development and aggravation of other chronic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is frequently considered the hepatic outcome of type 2 diabetes. The use of non-pharmacological therapies such as food supplements, nutraceuticals, and natural integrative therapies has grown as an alternative tool for obesity-related diseases compared to conventional medications. However, it is a still little explored research field and lacks scientific evidence of therapeutic effectiveness. Considering this, the aim is to evaluate whether a new nutraceutical supplement composition can improve and supply essential mineral nutrients, providing an improvement of obesity-related metabolic and endocrine parameters.",

In this study, to identify new criteria for estimating the effects of dietary supplements, we examined the relationships among the dietary supplements, the pre-conditions (PCs; defined as the life habits and sleep conditions before supplementation), and the sleep problems of subjects before supplementation. An open, randomized, cross-over intervention trial enrolling 160 subjects was conducted to test the efficacy of each dietary supplement (Analysis 1) and the relationships among dietary supplements, the PCs, and sleep problems (Analysis 2). To this end, l-theanine (200 mg/day), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (111.1 mg/day), ",

      "abstract": "Given the dual effects of iron on health, we carried out this study to explore its relationship with phenotypic age (PhenoAge) and to evaluate the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress in this regard. Since these associations are still poorly understood, elucidating them is vital for understanding aging-related health outcomes. A cross-sectional study was conducted using NHANES 2017-2018 data, involving 8692 participants aged 20 years or older. The nonlinear relationships between iron intake and PhenoAge acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) were assessed using weighted restricted cubic splines (RCS). Multivariable-adjusted analyses were performed using weighted generalized linear models (GLMs). K-means clustering was employed to identify patterns of iron co-exposure. Interaction effects were assessed using likelihood ratio tests, while mediation analyses were conducted to quantify the contributions of inflammation and oxidative stress markers. This study identified a U-shaped relationship between total iron intake and PhenoAgeAccel (breakpoint: 18.441 mg/day). Below this threshold, higher iron intake was protective against aging (β = -0.126); above it, aging accelerated (β = 0.021). Notably, dietary iron derived solely from food was not associated with any harmful effects on aging. In contrast, supplemental iron intake showed a positive association with PhenoAgeAccel (β = 0.017), highlighting the potential risks of excessive supplement use. Moreover, the aforementioned associations showed no gender differences. Cluster analysis split participants into two groups: dietary iron reference (DIR), mostly below the UL (45 mg/day) with minimal supplemental iron; and supplement-driven iron overload (SDIO), all exceeding the UL, with supplemental iron comprising 83.44 % of total intake on average. SDIO showed significantly faster phenotypic aging (β = 1.774) than DIR. However, anti-inflammatory or antioxidant diets were able to counteract this detrimental effect (P for interaction = 0.025). Inflammation-related markers partially mediated SDIO-associated aging acceleration (mediation proportion: 15.53 %-25.63 %). The results stayed robust even after adjusting for variables related to anemia and post-menstrual status. This study suggests that excessive use of supplements, resulting in iron overload, may accelerate individual aging through inflammation-related pathways. Nevertheless, a diet abundant in anti-inflammatory or antioxidant properties could counteract this heightened risk of aging.",

      "abstract": "Disordered eating is a serious health concern globally. The etiology is complex and multidimensional and differs somewhat for each specific eating disorder. Several risk factors have been identified which include psychological, genetic, biochemical, environmental, and sociocultural factors. Poor body image, low self-esteem, teasing, family dynamics, and exposure to media images have also been identified as risk factors. While it is enticing to consider a single behavioral risk factor, doing so fails to consider the documented environmental, social, psychological, biological, and cultural factors that contribute to the development of an eating disorder in a multidimensional and complex integration that is undoubtedly unique to everyone. Focusing only on any one factor without taking the complex etiology into account is remiss. For example, it has been suggested that the use of dietary supplements may lead to eating disorders, despite a lack of evidence to support this conjecture. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to examine the evidence-based risk factors for eating disorders and discuss why connecting dietary supplements to eating disorder etiology is not supported by the scientific literature and may interfere with treatment. Established, effective prevention and treatment approaches for eating disorders should be the focus of public health initiatives in this domain.",

      "abstract": "Oral nutrition supplements (ONS) are widely recommended for the management of unintentional weight loss in patient populations, long-term care residents, and community-dwelling older adults. Most marketed ONS are ultra-processed, with precision nutrition and aseptic composition, as well as convenience and availability, driving their selection. However, therapeutic effectiveness is mixed and the potential health risks of consuming ultra-processed ONS long-term in lieu of less-processed foods have received little attention. A diverse and balanced microbiota supporting immunity and wellness is maintained by a diet rich in plant-sourced foods. The implications of ultra-processed ONS displacing plant-sourced foods, and specifically the potential for undesirable impacts on the gut microbiota, require consideration. Most ONS are either devoid of fiber or are supplemented with isolated or purified fibers that may contribute to adverse gastrointestinal symptoms and appetite suppression. In contrast, the diversity of microbial-available, nondigestible carbohydrates, together with the array of phytochemicals found in plant-sourced foods, support microbial diversity and its resiliency. This review outlines the clinical dilemma of recommending commercial ultra-processed ONS vs nutritionally adequate (eg, high-energy/high-protein) foods and beverages that contribute to diet quality, maintenance of a diverse and stable gut microbiota composition, and support nutrition status and health. Ultra-processed ONS may fall short of expected health benefits, and overreliance may potentially contribute to the risk for patient and older adult populations because of the displacement of a variety of healthful foods.",

Nutraceuticals consist of nutrients, herbals, and dietary supplements, which make them useful in preserving and promoting health, fighting illness, and improving overall quality of life. Its success or failure will be determined by its rapid expansion, research advances, lack of standards, marketing enthusiasm, quality assurance, and regulations. Nutraceuticals have been used in different regions under different names/categories. however, globally there are no stringent pharmaceutical standards for nutraceutical health products till date, but slowly regulators are paying attention on it. Nutraceuticals can be broadly classified according to it clinical significance, source and therapeutic effects. Nutraceuticals and functional foods have grown to be a multibillion-dollar business worldwide in recent years and personalization is the emerging approach to deliver the best therapeutic effect in future. This review carries extensive information about nutraceutical history, classification, regulatory aspects and industrial perspective.",

Thermogenics, which are dietary supplements aimed at increasing energy expenditure, are particularly gaining popularity. These preparations can be easily purchased without prescription and have a complex composition, which means they can interact with numerous substances. The article describes the case of a 31-year-old female patient who, in a suicide attempt, ingested significant amounts of the dietary supplements 'Blue Magic' and 'Purim'. Both supplements contain, among other ingredients: caffeine, yohimbine, reserpine, and synephrine. The patient developed multiple organ failure, which led to her death on the second day of hospitalization. Poisoning by dietary supplements, due to their diverse composition and the lack of correlation between the content and the composition declared by the manufacturer, can pose a significant threat to the health and life of consumers.",

      "abstract": "The Incremental Model of Doping Behaviour suggests doping grows out of the habitual use of performance-enhancing methods (e.g., sport supplements) and belief that they are necessary for performance. Importantly, in this model, doping is viewed as functional rather than moral choice. In two studies, we examined whether sport supplement use was indirectly related to doping use via sport supplement beliefs, and whether personal morality moderated this relationship. Competitive athletes (Study 1, N = 366; Study 2, N = 200) completed measures of supplement use, beliefs, and doping use. They also completed measures of moral values (Study 1) and moral identity (Study 2). In both studies, supplement use was indirectly related to doping use via beliefs. Moreover, this indirect relationship was moderated by moral values (Study 1) and moral identity (Study 2). That is, the relationship between supplement use and doping use via beliefs was negated when moral values and moral identity were high but not when they were low or moderate. Taken together, our findings suggest that sport supplement users, who believe they are necessary, are more likely to dope if they have low moral values and believe that being a moral person is unimportant to their self-image.",

      "abstract": "Given the widespread use of dietary supplements (DS) and herbal products (HP), healthcare professionals (HCPs) will increasingly encounter patients who use these preparations with conventional drugs and who need their services to reduce the consequences of adverse therapeutic outcomes. The aim of our survey was to assess the knowledge and behaviors of HCPs regarding the risk of potential drug−dietary supplement (DDSIs) and drug−herbal product (DHPIs) interactions. This cross-sectional survey collected data via on paper-based questionnaire among general practitioners (GPs) (n = 105), specialty doctors (n = 87) and nurses (n = 154). The HCPs were mostly familiar with the interaction of doxycycline with magnesium (83%) and were least familiar with interaction of warfarin with glucosamine (14%). The results on DDSIs and DHPIs knowledge showed that GPs scored significantly higher than nurses (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), while specialty doctors scored significantly higher than nurses only on DDSIs knowledge (p < 0.001). Only 28% of respondents reported that they often or always ask patients on drug therapy about the use of DS or HP, and 25% of respondents record such data in the medical documentation of patients. Our results showed that HCPs have sufficient knowledge about most major DDSIs and DHPIs, but insufficient knowledge about most moderate interactions. However, their overall knowledge and behavior regarding the risk of these interactions indicate the need for further continuing education and training.",

      "title": "Frailty syndrome: A target for functional nutrients?",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a late life phenotype characterized by a decline in physiological reserve across several organ systems, resulting in the increased susceptibility to endogenous and/or exogenous stressors. Although the etiology of frailty remains poorly understood, an interconnected network of putative mechanisms linked to the ageing process has been proposed. However, frailty is a dynamic process that may be prevented, delayed, or even reversed. The syndromic nature of frailty requires a multidomain approach, such as proper nutrition, as part of modifiable environmental factors, and represents one of the most promising and least costly ways to prevent and reduce frailty among older adults. Nutrient deficiencies have been consistently associated with frailty; however, mounting evidence also supports the hypothesis that beyond the traditional nutritional value, specific dietary components may exert function-enhancing effects and mitigate the extent of frailty. Thus, further mechanistic studies, along with large clinical trials, are imperative to establish the exact role of functional nutrients in the clinical management of frailty. Here, we provide a contemporary discussion of how emerging functional nutrients may contribute to modify the trajectory of the frailty syndrome.",

      "abstract": "In the past decade, a body of evidence has reported that dietary supplement use is related to prohibited performance enhancing substance use (i.e., doping). To help international and national sport organisations understand the degree to which dietary supplement use is related to doping, the objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to 1) compare the prevalence of doping between dietary supplement users and non-users and 2) identify whether supplement use is related to doping social cognitive factors. We searched for studies sampling athletes and that measured both dietary supplement use and doping in EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus from database creation to May 2022. Risk of bias was assessed using JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for cross-sectional studies and the STROBE checklist. Twenty-six cross-sectional studies, involving 13,296 athletes were included. Random-effect models revealed that doping was 2.74 (95% CI=2.10 to 3.57) times more prevalent in dietary supplement users (pooled prevalence = 14.7%) than non-users (6.7%), and that users reported stronger doping intentions (r=0.26, 0.18 to 0.34) and attitudes (r=0.21, 0.13 to 0.28) compared to non-users. Preliminary evidence also suggests that dietary supplement users were less likely to dope if they were more task oriented and had a stronger sense of morality. Results of the review are limited by the cross-sectional design used in all studies and lack of consistency in measurement of dietary supplement use and doping. Data indicate that athletes using dietary supplements are more likely to self-report doping Anti-doping policy should, therefore, target dietary supplement use in anti-doping education programmes by providing alternative strategies for performance enhancement or highlighting the safest ways they can be consumed. Similarly, as a large proportion of athletes use dietary supplements without doping, further research is needed to understand the factors that protect a dietary supplement user from doping. No funding was received for the review. A study protocol can be found here: https://osf.io/xvcaq.",

Wearables may enable continuous health care provider-patient partnerships and reduce the volume of episodic clinic-based care (thereby reducing health care costs). However, challenges arise from the unregulated use of these devices, including questionable data reliability, potential misinterpretation of information, unintended psychological impacts, and an influx of clinically nonactionable data that may overburden the health care system. Further, these technologies could exacerbate, rather than mitigate, health disparities. Experience with wearables in atrial fibrillation underscores these challenges. The prevalent use of D2C wearables necessitates a collaborative approach among stakeholders to ensure effective integration into cardiovascular care. Wearables are heralding innovative disease screening, diagnosis, and management paradigms, expanding therapeutic avenues, and anchoring personalized medicine.",

Standard protocols, upon positive screen, refer families to community resources, such as food pantries, but followthrough rates are low. Good Apple (GA) was developed to deliver fresh produce and pantry staples to the homes of families facing FI, as identified by pediatricians. Good Apple uses a two-sided, self-sustaining business model: a subscription-based produce delivery service generates revenue from paying customers, which funds free grocery delivery services for families facing FI. The program works with (1) local farmers to rescue and redistribute unsold fruits and vegetables; (2) local food pantries to supplement deliveries with proteins, grains, and dairy; and (3) pediatricians who prescribe GA to families facing FI. Good Apple helps food pantries reach more clients; empowers pediatricians with closed-loop referrals; and delivers healthy food to families facing FI and transportation barriers.",

      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, lower-income countries suffer from adverse health issues more than higher-income countries. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have the potential to resolve these issues. Previous research has analyzed the theoretical and empirical causal effects of ICT on infant mortality at country-specific and global levels for a short period of time. However, the causes and results could be different in low-income countries. The objective of this paper was to examine the deficiencies through the use of panel data from 27 low-income countries from 2000-2017. We applied the predictive mean matching technique to supplement the missing data and then used panel data techniques (i.e., fixed effects (FE) and pooled common correlated effects (PCCE)), and system-GMM to estimate the causal effects. We compared the consistency and the possible heterogeneity of previous results using a set of robust techniques and empirical tests. We found that internet access and, to a lesser extent, cellular mobile subscriptions, two of the three ICT variables used in our research, had a significant positive effect on reducing infant mortality in low-income countries. In conclusion, governments and policymakers of low-income countries should consider the availability of internet-related ICT innovations and make them nationally accessible to reduce health crises such as the infant mortality rate.",

Recent work on megastudies, massive field experiments that test many interventions simultaneously, reveals that nudge effectiveness both varies widely and is difficult for experts to predict. We propose an Iterative Crowdsourcing Procedure, which uses insights from members of the target population to generate and preselect nudges prior to testing them in a field experiment. This technique can supplement existing methods or stand alone as a way to generate conditions for testing in a high-quality field experiment. We test the effectiveness of this method in addressing a challenge to effective financial management: consumer oversubscription. We first document that people have more subscriptions than they think they have and that enhancing subscription awareness makes people want to cancel some subscriptions. We then use our crowdsourcing procedure to motivate people toward subscription awareness in a field experiment (N = 4,412,113) with a large bank. We find that the crowdsourced nudges outperform those generated by the bank, demonstrating that the Iterative Crowdsourcing Procedure is a useful way to generate effective nudges.",

      "abstract": "Football is a global game which is constantly evolving, showing substantial increases in physical and technical demands. Nutrition plays a valuable integrated role in optimising performance of elite players during training and match-play, and maintaining their overall health throughout the season. An evidence-based approach to nutrition emphasising, a 'food first' philosophy (ie, food over supplements), is fundamental to ensure effective player support. This requires relevant scientific evidence to be applied according to the constraints of what is practical and feasible in the football setting. The science underpinning sports nutrition is evolving fast, and practitioners must be alert to new developments. In response to these developments, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has gathered experts in applied sports nutrition research as well as practitioners working with elite football clubs and national associations/federations to issue an expert statement on a range of topics relevant to elite football nutrition: (1) match day nutrition, (2) training day nutrition, (3) body composition, (4) stressful environments and travel, (5) cultural diversity and dietary considerations, (6) dietary supplements, (7) rehabilitation, (8) referees and (9) junior high-level players. The expert group provide a narrative synthesis of the scientific background relating to these topics based on their knowledge and experience of the scientific research literature, as well as practical experience of applying knowledge within an elite sports setting. Our intention is to provide readers with content to help drive their own practical recommendations. In addition, to provide guidance to applied researchers where to focus future efforts.",

      "abstract": "Nutrition generally refers to the macro- and micro-nutrients essential for survival, but we do not simply eat nutrition. Instead, we eat animal- and plant-based foods without always being conscious of its nutritional value. Furthermore, various cultural factors influence and shape our taste, preferences, taboos and practices towards preparing and consuming food as a meal and diet. Biogerontological understanding of ageing has identified food as one of the three foundational pillars of health and survival. Here we address the issues of nutrition, food and diet by analyzing the biological importance of macro- and micro-nutrients including hormetins, discussing the health claims for various types of food, and by reviewing the general principles of healthy dietary patterns, including meal timing, caloric restriction, and intermittent fasting. We also present our views about the need for refining our approaches and strategies for future research on nutrition, food and diet by incorporating the molecular, physiological, cultural and personal aspects of this crucial pillar of health, healthy ageing and longevity.",

      "abstract": "Anyone who wants to understand the biological nature of humans and their special characteristics must look far back into evolutionary history. Today's way of life is drastically different from that of our ancestors. For almost 99% of human history, gathering and hunting have been the basis of nutrition. It was not until about 12,000 years ago that humans began domesticating plants and animals. Bioarchaeologically and biochemically, this can be traced back to our earliest roots. Modern living conditions and the quality of human life are better today than ever before. However, neither physically nor psychosocially have we made this adjustment and we are paying a high health price for it. The studies presented allow us to reconstruct food supply, lifestyles, and dietary habits: from the earliest primates, through hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic, farming communities since the beginning of the Anthropocene, to the Industrial Age and the present. The comprehensive data pool allows extraction of all findings of medical relevance. Our recent lifestyle and diet are essentially determined by our culture rather than by our millions of years of ancestry. Culture is permanently in a dominant position compared to natural evolution. Thereby culture does not form a contrast to nature but represents its result. There is no doubt that we are biologically adapted to culture, but it is questionable how much culture humans can cope with.",

      "abstract": "Despite the emergence of stronger nutritional science over the past two decades, fad diets remain highly popular. However, growing medical evidence has led to the endorsement of healthy eating patterns by medical societies. This thus allows fad diets to be compared to the emerging scientific evidence as to which diets promote or damage health. In this narrative review, the most popular current fad diets are critically analyzed, including low-fat diets, vegan and vegetarian diets, low-carbohydrate diets, ketogenic diets, Paleolithic diets, and intermittent fasting. Each of these diets has some scientific merit, but each has potential deficiencies relative to the findings of nutritional science. This article also presents the common themes that emerge among the dietary guidance of leading health organizations, such as the American Heart Association and the American College of Lifestyle Medicine. While there are important distinctions between dietary recommendations emanating from various medical societies, each recommends eating more unrefined, plant-based foods, while eating fewer highly processed foods and added sugars, and avoiding excessive calorie consumption as an important nutritional strategy for the prevention and management of chronic conditions and promotion of overall health.",

      "abstract": "Throughout their experience of illness and during the course of treatment, a substantial proportion of cancer patients are prone to develop nutritional and/or metabolic disturbances. Additionally, cancer patients often encounter long-term side effects from therapies, which may lead to impaired digestion, nutrient absorption or bowel motility. Therefore, the preservation and maintenance of an optimal and balanced nutritional status are pivotal to achieving a better prognosis, increasing the tolerance and adherence to cancer therapies and improving the overall quality of life. In this context, personalized nutritional programs are essential for addressing conditions predisposing to weight loss, feeding difficulties, digestion problems and intestinal irregularity, with the goal of promoting adequate nutrient absorption and minimizing the detrimental effects of treatment regimens. The focus of this research is to examine the most common clinical conditions and metabolic changes that cancer patients may experience, including stomatitis, xerostomia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, sub-occlusion, dysgeusia, dysosmia, anorexia, and cachexia. Furthermore, we present a pragmatic example of a multidisciplinary workflow that incorporates customized recipes tailored to individual clinical scenarios, all while maintaining the hedonic value of the meals.",

      "title": "Gut Microbiota and Time-Restricted Feeding/Eating: A Targeted Biomarker and Approach in Precision Nutrition.",
      "abstract": "Each individual has a unique gut microbiota; therefore, the genes in our microbiome outnumber the genes in our genome by about 150 to 1. Perturbation in host nutritional status influences gut microbiome composition and vice versa. The gut microbiome can help in producing vitamins, hormones, and other active metabolites that support the immune system; harvest energy from food; aid in digestion; protect against pathogens; improve gut transit and function; send signals to the brain and other organs; oscillate the circadian rhythm; and coordinate with the host metabolism through multiple cellular pathways. Gut microbiota can be influenced by host genetics, medications, diet, and lifestyle factors from preterm to aging. Aligning with precision nutrition, identifying a personalized microbiome mandates the provision of the right nutrients at the right time to the right patient. Thus, before prescribing a personalized treatment, it is crucial to monitor and count the gut flora as a focused biomarker. Many nutritional approaches that have been developed help in maintaining and restoring an optimal microbiome such as specific diet therapy, nutrition interventions, and customized eating patterns. One of these approaches is time-restricted feeding/eating (TRF/E), a type of intermittent fasting (IF) in which a subject abstains from food intake for a specific time window. Such a dietary modification might alter and restore the gut microbiome for proper alignment of cellular and molecular pathways throughout the lifespan. In this review, we have highlighted that the gut microbiota would be a targeted biomarker and TRF/E would be a targeted approach for restoring the gut-microbiome-associated molecular pathways such as hormonal signaling, the circadian system, metabolic regulators, neural responses, and immune-inflammatory pathways. Consequently, modulation of the gut microbiota through TRF/E could contribute to proper utilization and availability of the nutrients and in this way confer protection against diseases for harnessing personalized nutrition approaches to improve human health.",

      "title": "Vitamin B-12 and the Gastrointestinal Microbiome: A Systematic Review.",
      "abstract": "Vitamin B-12 deficiency is a major public health problem affecting individuals across the lifespan, with known hematological, neurological, and obstetric consequences. Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin B-12 may have an important role in other aspects of human health, including the composition and function of the gastrointestinal (gut) microbiome. Vitamin B-12 is synthesized and utilized by bacteria in the human gut microbiome and is required for over a dozen enzymes in bacteria, compared to only 2 in humans. However, the impact of vitamin B-12 on the gut microbiome has not been established. This systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence that links vitamin B-12 and the gut microbiome. A structured search strategy was used to identify in vitro, animal, and human studies that assessed vitamin B-12 status, dietary intake, or supplementation, and the gut microbiome using culture-independent techniques. A total of 22 studies (3 in vitro, 8 animal, 11 human observational studies) were included. Nineteen studies reported that vitamin B-12 intake, status, or supplementation was associated with gut microbiome outcomes, including beta-diversity, alpha-diversity, relative abundance of bacteria, functional capacity, or short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production. Evidence suggests that vitamin B-12 may be associated with changes in bacterial abundance. While results from in vitro studies suggest that vitamin B-12 may increase alpha-diversity and shift gut microbiome composition (beta-diversity), findings from animal studies and observational human studies were heterogeneous. Based on evidence from in vitro and animal studies, microbiome outcomes may differ by cobalamin form and co-intervention. To date, few prospective observational studies and no randomized trials have been conducted to examine the effects of vitamin B-12 on the human gut microbiome. The impact of vitamin B-12 on the gut microbiome needs to be elucidated to inform screening and public health interventions.",

This review synthesizes key aspects of PN, emphasizing the genetic basis of dietary responses, contemporary research, and practical applications. We explore how individual genetic differences influence dietary metabolisms, thus underscoring the importance of nutrigenomics in developing personalized dietary guidelines. Current research in PN highlights significant gene-diet interactions that affect various conditions, including obesity and diabetes, suggesting that dietary interventions could be more precise and beneficial if they are customized to genetic profiles. Moreover, we discuss practical implementations of PN, including technological advancements in genetic testing that enable real-time dietary customization. Looking forward, this review identifies the robust integration of bioinformatics and genomics as critical for advancing PN. We advocate for multidisciplinary research to overcome current challenges, such as data privacy and ethical concerns associated with genetic testing. The future of PN lies in broader adoption across health and wellness sectors, promising significant advancements in public health and personalized medicine.",

      "abstract": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory disease with strong genetic links and numerous features of autoimmunity that are also influenced by environment and lifestyle, including nutritional factors and physical activity (PA), with regards to the condition of patients. Recent reports in the field of nutrigenomics indicate a significant impact of nutrients in modulating microRNAs. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of nutritional systems and PA on treating psoriasis. This narrative review updates information regarding the current dietary recommendations for individuals with psoriasis and discusses the role of diet and PA in psoriasis prevention and treatment. Application of nutrigenetics in psoriasis therapy is also discussed. The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched using the MeSH terms for \"nutrigenomics\", \"dietetics\", \"diet therapy\", \"diet\", \"physical activity\", and \"exercise\" in conjunction with the MeSH terms for \"psoriasis\" and \"dermatology\". Evidence has shown that patients with psoriasis should have a personalized anti-inflammatory diet. Psoriasis patients are less physically active; most performed exercises of low-to-moderate intensity and were less likely to undertake regular exercise. Identifying nutrigenomic discoveries and the current lifestyle interventions associated with psoriasis can help physicians and physical therapists develop educational programs to manage and protect against the disease.",

      "abstract": "The effect of diet on sleep quality has been addressed in many studies; however, whether/how plant-based diets (PBDs) impact sleep-related parameters has not been explored in detail. This review aims to give an overview of the components of PBDs and the possible mechanisms through which PBDs may improve sleep quality. Studies have indicated that diets such as PBDs, which are typically high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and fiber, are associated with better sleep outcomes, including less fragmented sleep and improved sleep duration. Several mechanisms may explain how PBDs impact and/or improve sleep outcomes. Firstly, PBDs are characteristically rich in certain nutrients, such as magnesium and vitamin B6, which have been associated with improved sleep patterns. Secondly, PBDs are often lower in saturated fats and higher in fiber, which may contribute to better overall health, including sleep quality. Additionally, plant bioactive compounds like phytochemicals and antioxidants in fruits, vegetables, and herbs may have sleep-promoting effects. According to available data, PBD and Mediterranean diet elements promise to enhance sleep quality; however, it is crucial to note that diets should be customized based on each person's needs.",

Investigations reveal that long-term high salt intake, mainly sodium intake, induces a relevant increase in blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive individuals. According to most scientific evidence, a diet with high salt intake in public increases cardiovascular risk, salted-related HTN, and other HTN-associated outcomes. Given the clinical importance, this review aims to present the prevalence of HTN and trends in salt intake in the Chinese population and will comprehensively discuss the risk factors, causes, and mechanisms of the association between salt intake and HTN. The review also highlights the education of Chinese people regarding salt intake and the cost-effectiveness of salt reduction from a global perspective. Finally, the review will emphasize the need to customize the unique Chinese practices to reduce salt intake and how awareness changes people's eating lifestyle and helps adopt diet salt reduction strategies.",

      "abstract": "For thousands of years, disabilities due to nutrient deficiencies have plagued humanity. Rickets, scurvy, anemia, stunted growth, blindness, and mental handicaps due to nutrient deficiencies affected up to 1/10 of the world's population prior to 1900. The discovery of essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, in the early 1900s, led to a fundamental change in our understanding of food and a revolution in human health. Widespread vitamin and mineral supplementation, the development of recommended dietary allowances, and the implementation of food labeling and testing along with significant improvements in food production and food quality have meant that nutrient-related disorders have almost vanished in the developed world. The success of nutritional science in preventing disease at a population-wide level is one of the great scientific triumphs of the 20th century. The challenge for nutritional science in the 21st century is to understand how to use nutrients and other food constituents to enhance human health or prevent disease at a more personal level. This is the primary goal of precision nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Despite mounting recognition of the essential role of women's empowerment in household dietary and nutrition changes, the diversity of culture across African countries presents ambiguity as to whether its impact is experienced homogeneously across the continent. This article presents a systematic review of whether women's empowerment changes household dietary patterns, contributes to nutrition improvement, and consequently affects diet-related health outcomes in Africa. We find that whilst more research needs to be conducted, particularly with improved methodologies that can establish cause-effect relationships, there is consensus among the literature on the link between women's empowerment and some domains of food security and dietary improvement. Meanwhile, studies on women's empowerment and the additional demand pressure on some food categories are quite limited. This exacerbates the challenge of setting production plans that aim to address the continent's question of food.",

      "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an entirely coherent system, with internal logic and consistency of thought and practice. Though TCM has a long history, it is not easily accepted by Western medicine due to its theoretical and conceptual complexity. TCM nutrition is an ancient but burgeoning discipline, and its main goal is to use food as a means to achieve balance and harmony within the body. Compared with modern nutrition, it has unique beneficial concepts, such as the holism, diet suggestions based on syndrome differentiation, the idea that the spleen-stomach is the \"root\" of post-heaven, and the homology of medicine and food. Until today, it is difficult to evaluate whether TCM nutrition could play a major role in the treatment of various diseases. The limitations mainly include: the scope of application is limited, lack of evidence-based research, and the constitution differentiation need the cooperation of clinicians of TCM. In contemporary China, the inheritance, innovation, and broadening the scope of applications of TCM nutrition is very important. The government should establish a system in which TCM nutrition and modern nutrition coexist, and perform higher specialist training for dietitians of TCM. Moreover, TCM nutrition should integrate the research methods of modern nutrition, and involve adjustment to target populations, the formulation of age-specific nutrition principles, and an emphasis on the research and development of nutritional food, thus fully demonstrating the advantages and characteristics of TCM nutrition.",

Therefore, the in-depth and extensive research of Suaeda has become a research hotspot around the world. However, only one review summarized the nutritional, chemical and biological values of Suaeda. By searching the international authoritative databases (ACS Publications, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Springer, web of Science and Bing International etc.) and collecting 103 literatures closely related to Suaeda (1895-2021), herewith a comprehensive and systematic review was conducted on the phytology, chemistry, pharmacology and clinical application, enveloping the classification evolution between Amaranthaceae and Chenopodiaceae, distribution and common botanical characteristics; involving 9 chemical categories of 163 derivatives covering 14 new and 6 first-isolated ones, and appraising the content determination of 6 categories of components; mainly including the pharmacology of 13 species in vivo and vitro; estimating the clinical application of 16 species cured the related diseases of eight human physiological system except for the motor system. It is expected that this paper will provide forward-looking scientific ideas and literature support for the further modern research, development and utilization of the genus.",

      "title": "Nutrigenomics in crustaceans: Current status and future prospects.",
      "abstract": "In aquaculture, nutrigenomics or \"nutritional genomics\" is concerned with studying the impacts of nutrients and food ingredients on gene expressions and understanding the interactions that may occur between nutrients and dietary bioactive ingredients with the genome and cellular molecules of the treated aquatic animals at the molecular levels that will, in turn, mediate gene expression. This concept will throw light on or provide important information to recognize better how specific nutrients may influence the overall health status of aquatic organisms. In crustaceans, it is well known that the nutritional requirements vary among different species. Thus, studying the nutrigenomics in different crustacean species is of significant importance. Of interest, recognition of the actual mechanisms that may be associated with the effects of the nutrients on the immune responses of crustaceans will provide clear outstanding protection, build a solid immune system, and also decrease the possibilities of the emergence of infectious diseases in the culture systems. Similarly, the growth, molting, lipid metabolism, antioxidant capacity, and reproduction could be effectively enhanced by using specific nutrients. In the area of crustacean research, nutrigenomics has been rapidly grown for addressing several aspects related to the influences of nutrients on crustacean development. Several researchers have studied the relationships between several functional genes and their expression profile with several physiological functions of crustaceans. They found a close association between the effects of optimal feeding with efficient production, growth, reproduction development, and health status of several crustacean species. Moreover, they illustrated that regulation of the gene expression in individual cells by different nutrients and formulated feeds could improve the growth development and immunity-boosting of several crustacean species. The present review will spotlight on such relationships between the dietary nutrients and expression of genes linked with growth, metabolism, molting, antioxidant, reproduction, and immunity of several crustacean species. The literature included in this review article will provide references and future outlooks for the upcoming research plans. This will contribute positively for maintaining the sustainability of the sector of the crustacean industry.",

      "abstract": "Plant-derived chemicals are a source of novel chemotherapeutic agents. Throughout the human civilization, these novel chemicals have led to the discovery of new pharmacological active agents. Research on herbal medicine is of great importance, as most of the active agents used for treating numerous diseases are from natural sources, while other agents are either semisynthetic or synthetic. Pongamol, a flavonoid, which is the main constituent of Pongamia pinnata, is one such active agents, which exhibits diverse pharmacological activities. Various in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that pongamol is a potentially active agent, as it exerts anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-diabetic activities. Accordingly, the aim of the present review was to give an up-to-date overview on the chemistry, isolation, bioavailability, pharmacological activity, and health benefits of pongamol. This review focuses on the medicinal and health promoting activities of pongamol, along with possible mechanisms of action. For this purpose, this review summarizes the most recent literature pertaining to pongamol as a therapeutic agent against several diseases. In addition, the review covers information related to the toxicological assessment and safety of this phytochemical, and highlights the medicinal and folk values of this compound against various diseases and ailments.",

      "abstract": "High obesity rates in almost all regions of the world prompt an urgent need for effective obesity prevention. Very good scientific evidence from cell culture and rodent studies show that the availability of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and their long-chain polyunsaturated derivatives, namely, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, influence adipogenesis; for this reason, early life status may influence later obesity risk. The respective PUFA effects could be mediated via their eicosanoid derivatives, their influence on cell membrane properties, the browning of white adipose tissue, changes to the offspring gut microbiome, their influence on developing regulatory circuits, and gene expression during critical periods. Randomized clinical trials and observational studies show divergent findings in humans, with mostly null findings but also the positive and negative effects of an increased n-3 to n-6 PUFA ratio on BMI and fat mass development. Hence, animal study findings cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. Even though the mechanistic data basis for the effects of n-3 PUFA on obesity risk appears promising, no recommendations for humans can be derived at present.",

      "title": "Optimizing Maternal Nutrition: The Importance of a Tailored Approach.",
      "abstract": "Improving nutritional status during pregnancy is a global interest. Frequently, women either fail to meet or exceed nutrient recommendations. Current strategies to improve maternal nutrition focus on a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach and fail to consider individual factors that affect the mother's overall nutritional status. The objectives of this review were to determine the importance of key nutrients for optimal maternal and fetal health, to explore to what extent current recommendations consider individual factors, and to explore novel strategies to close the gap between current guidelines and real-world challenges through more personalized approaches. This review intercalated different nutritional guidelines and recent scientific publications and research initiatives related to maternal nutrition. Based on that, an overview of current recommendations, challenges related to present approaches, and perspectives for future directions are described. Current guidelines are not optimally supporting adequate nutrient intake and health of expectant mothers and their offspring. Existing recommendations are not consistent and do not sufficiently take into account how interindividual variation leads to differences in nutrient status. Personalized nutrition offers women the opportunity to improve their health by using strategies that are tailored to their unique nutritional needs. Such strategies can include personalized supplementation, holistic lifestyle interventions, digital and application-based technologies, and dietary assessment through blood biomarker and genetic analysis. However, these approaches warrant further investigation and optimization. More personalized approaches have the potential to optimize mothers' and their offspring's health outcomes more appropriately to their nutritional needs before, during, and after pregnancy. Moving away from a generalized \"one-size-fits-all\" approach can be achieved through a variety of means. Future aims should be to provide supporting evidence to create customized subpopulation-based or individualized recommendations, improve nutrition education, and develop novel approaches to improve adherence to dietary and lifestyle interventions.",
