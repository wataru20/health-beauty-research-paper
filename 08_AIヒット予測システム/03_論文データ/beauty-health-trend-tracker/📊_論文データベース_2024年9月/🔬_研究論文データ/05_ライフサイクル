      "abstract": "Normal spermatogenesis and sperm function are crucial for male fertility. The effects of healthy testicular aging and testicular premature aging on spermatogenesis, sperm function, and the spermatogenesis microenvironment cannot be ignored. Compared with younger men, the testis of older men tends to have disturbed spermatogenic processes, sperm abnormalities, sperm dysfunction, and impaired Sertoli and Leydig cells, which ultimately results in male infertility. Various exogenous and endogenous factors also contribute to pathological testicular premature aging, such as adverse environmental stressors and gene mutations. Mechanistically, Y-chromosomal microdeletions, increase in telomere length and oxidative stress, accumulation of DNA damage with decreased repair ability, alterations in epigenetic modifications, miRNA and lncRNA expression abnormalities, have been associated with impaired male fertility due to aging. In recent years, the key molecules and signaling pathways that regulate testicular aging and premature aging have been identified, thereby providing new strategies for diagnosis and treatment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the underlying mechanisms of aging on spermatogenesis. Furthermore, potential rescue measures for reproductive aging have been discussed. Finally, the inadequacy of testicular aging research and future directions for research have been envisaged to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of testicular aging and premature aging.",

      "abstract": "Available evidence from IVF studies supports a detrimental effect of submucosal and intramural fibroids on embryo implantation. It is misleading, however, to infer evidence obtained in IVF settings to natural fertility. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on the effect of fibroids on natural fertility. Studies comparing fertile and infertile women, and those investigating whether the presence of fibroids was a risk factor, were reviewed, as well as studies comparing women with and without fibroids. The aim was also to establish whether the frequency of infertility differed between the two groups. Seven out of 11 selected studies did not aim to establish whether fibroids caused infertility but, rather, whether a history of infertility could be a risk factor for fibroids. A meta-analysis of the four remaining studies that concomitantly evaluated the presence of fibroids and infertility studies highlighted a common odds ratio of fibroids in subfertile women of 3.54 (95% CI 1.55 to 8.11). When focusing on the two most informative studies, i.e. the studies comparing time to pregnancy in women with and without fibroids, the common OR was 1.93 (95% CI 0.89 to 4.18). In conclusion, the association between fibroids and infertility has been insufficiently investigated. Epidemiological studies suggest, but do not demonstrate, that fibroids may interfere with natural fertility. Given the high prevalence of these lesions in women seeking pregnancy, further evidence is urgently needed.",

      "abstract": "Uterine aging is an important factor that impacts fertility, reproductive health, and uterus-related diseases; however, it remains poorly explored. Functionally, these disturbances have been associated with an abnormal hormonal response in the endometrium and decreased endometrial receptivity. Based on emerging evidence, these alterations are mediated via the senescence of endometrial stem cells and impaired decidualization of endometrial stromal cells. Multiple molecular activities may participate in uterine aging, including oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, DNA damage response, and cellular senescence. Over the past decade, several protective strategies targeting these biological processes have afforded promising results, including stem cell therapy, anti-aging drugs, and herbal medicines. However, the currently available evidence is fragmented and scattered. Here, we summarize the most recent findings regarding uterine aging, including functional and structural alterations and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms, and discuss potential protective interventions against uterine aging. Thereby, we hope to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological processes and underlying mechanisms associated with uterine aging, as well as improve fecundity and reproductive outcomes in females of advanced reproductive age.",

      "abstract": "Increasing numbers of women are undergoing oocyte or tissue cryopreservation for medical or social reasons to increase their chances of having genetic children. Social egg freezing (SEF) allows women to preserve their fertility in anticipation of age-related fertility decline and ineffective fertility treatments at older ages. The purpose of this study was to summarize recent findings focusing on the challenges of elective egg freezing. We performed a systematic literature review on social egg freezing published during the last ten years. From the systematically screened literature, we identified and analyzed five main topics of interest during the last decade: (a) different fertility preservation techniques, (b) safety of freezing, (c) usage rate of frozen oocytes, (d) ethical considerations, and (e) cost-effectiveness of SEF. Fertility can be preserved for non-medical reasons through oocyte, embryos, or ovarian tissue cryopreservation, with oocyte vitrification being a new and optimal approach. Elective oocyte cryopreservation is better accepted, supports social gender equality, and enhances women's reproductive autonomy. Despite controversies, planned oocyte cryopreservation appears as a chosen strategy against age-related infertility and may allow women to feel that they are more socially, psychologically, and financially stable before motherhood.",

      "abstract": "In a society where women often want successful careers and equal opportunities to men, the early nature of ovarian aging often forces women to make difficult life choices between career and family development. Fertility in women begins to decline after the age of 37 years and it is rare for pregnancies to occur after 45. This reproductive decline in women is inevitable and culminates in menopause, which is a major driver of age-related diseases. In a world where biomedical advances are leading to modifiable biological outcomes, it is time to focus on mitigating female reproductive senescence to maintain fertility and preserve age-related hormonal functions, with the goal of providing increased life choices and enhancing healthspan. To date, reproductive longevity research remains an understudied field. More needs to be done to unravel the biology of the ovarian follicles, which are the functional units of reproductive lifespan and are comprised of cell types including the oocyte (female gamete) and a group of specialized supporting somatic cells. Biological attempts to maintain the quality and quantity of follicles in animal models through manipulating pathways involved in aging can potentially prolong female reproductive lifespan and healthspan. Here, we summarize the molecular events driving ovarian aging and menopause and the interventional strategies to offset these events. Developing solutions to female reproductive senescence will open doors to discover ways to enhance true healthy longevity for both men and women.",

      "title": "Ovarian aging in humans: potential strategies for extending reproductive lifespan.",
      "abstract": "Ovarian reserve is a term used to estimate the total number of immature follicles present in the ovaries. Between birth and menopause, there is a progressive decrease in the number of ovarian follicles. Ovarian aging is a continuous physiological phenomenon, with menopause being the clinical mark of the end of ovarian function. Genetics, measured as family history for age at the onset of menopause, is the main determinant. However, physical activity, diet, and lifestyle are important factors that can influence the age of menopause. The low estrogen levels after natural or premature menopause increased the risk for several diseases, resulting in increased mortality risk. Besides that, the decreasing ovarian reserve is associated to reduced fertility. In women with infertility undergoing in vitro fertilization, reduced markers of ovarian reserve, including antral follicular count and anti-Mullerian hormone, are the main indicators of reduced chances of becoming pregnant. Therefore, it becomes clear that the ovarian reserve has a central role in women's life, affecting fertility early in life and overall health later in life. Based on this, the ideal strategy for delaying ovarian aging should have the following characteristics: (1) be initiated in the presence of good ovarian reserve; (2) maintained for a long period; (3) have an action on the dynamics of primordial follicles, controlling the rate of activation and atresia; and (4) safe use in pre-conception, pregnancy, and lactation. In this review, we therefore discuss some of these strategies and its feasibility for preventing a decline in the ovarian reserve.",

      "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly difficult to avoid exposure to man-made endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and environmental toxicants. This escalating yet constant exposure is postulated to partially explain the concurrent decline in human fertility that has occurred over the last 50 years. Controversy however remains as to whether associations exist, with conflicting findings commonly reported for all major EDC classes. The primary aim of this extensive work was to identify and review strong peer-reviewed evidence regarding the effects of environmentally-relevant EDC concentrations on adult male and female fertility during the critical periconception period on reproductive hormone concentrations, gamete and embryo characteristics, as well as the time to pregnancy in the general population. Secondly, to ascertain whether individuals or couples diagnosed as sub-fertile exhibit higher EDC or toxicant concentrations. Lastly, to highlight where little or no data exists that prevents strong associations being identified. From the greater than 1480 known EDCs, substantial evidence supports a negative association between exposure to phthalates, PCBs, PBDEs, pyrethroids, organochloride pesticides and male fertility and fecundity. Only moderate evidence exists for a negative association between BPA, PCBs, organochloride pesticides and female fertility and fecundity. Overall fewer studies were reported in women than men, with knowledge gaps generally evident for both sexes for all the major EDC classes, as well as a paucity of female fertility studies following exposure to parabens, triclosans, dioxins, PFAS, organophosphates and pyrethroids. Generally, sub-fertile individuals or couples exhibit higher EDC concentrations, endorsing a positive association between EDC exposure and sub-fertility. This review also discusses confounding and limiting factors that hamper our understanding of EDC exposures on fertility and fecundity. Finally, it highlights future research areas, as well as government, industry and social awareness strategies required to mitigate the negative effects of EDC and environmental toxicant exposure on human fertility and fecundity.",

We observe considerable testosterone recovery and Leydig cell maturation after AAV8-Lhcgr treatment in pubertal Lhcgr",

      "abstract": "Overweight and obesity-chronic illnesses in which an increase in body fat promotes adipose tissue dysfunction and abnormal fat mass resulting in adverse metabolic, biomechanical, and psychosocial health consequences-negatively impact female fertility. Adverse conception outcomes are multifactorial, ranging from poor oocyte quality and implantation issues to miscarriages and fetal health issues. However, with the advent of novel pharmacologic agents, significant weight loss can be achieved, improving the chances of healthy pregnancies, and their use should be considered during periconceptual counseling. There are currently 6 FDA-approved medications for weight loss: 2 GLP1-receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) liraglutide and semaglutide, 1 dual GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory peptide agonist (GLP1-GIP) tirzepatide, Contrave (naltrexone/bupropion), Qsymia (phentermine/Topamax), and Xenical (orlistat). GLP1-RAs reduce food cravings, appetite, and \"food noise\" and improve insulin sensitivity and satiety, all of which lead to significant weight loss, ranging from 6 to 30% of starting total body weight or greater, depending on the specific agent used. Their efficacy and relative safety should make them first-line options for women seeking to lose weight in the year before trying to conceive. Contrave, the combination of naltrexone and bupropion, seems to work most significantly for weight loss by inhibiting the rewarding and reinforcing effects of food consumption. Clinical trials report ~ 6% loss of starting total body weight with use of Contrave, as well as improvement in metabolic health factors. It may also improve a woman's ability to conceive by mitigating the effects of PCOS and endometriosis and reducing the drive for alcohol and smoking. Qsymia, the combination of phentermine and topiramate, results in more weight loss than Contrave but cannot be used in the acute preconception period, as its topiramate component is a known teratogen. Orlistat is another FDA-approved medication for weight loss; however, it is currently used much less often than other anti-obesity drugs because of its relatively lower efficacy and significant side effects. Bariatric surgery, which can lead to significant weight loss (25-50%), was previously regarded as the most durable method for weight loss, before the advent of GLP1-RAs. Given the inherent risks of surgery, the development of vitamin (i.e. B12, folate, vitamin D) and mineral (i.e. iron, copper, zinc) deficiencies, that may impact the health of the mother and fetus, as well as the recommended delay of 1-2 years prior to attempting pregnancy, bariatric surgery should not be considered first-line therapy for obesity management in women of reproductive age, especially for women who are hoping to conceive quickly or are nearing advanced maternal age.",

Here we combine endogenous-fluorescent tracing mouse models with a high-resolution live-cell imaging system to characterize oocyte-derived mushroom-like microvilli (Oo-Mvi), which mediate germ-somatic communication in mice. We perform 3D live-cell imaging to show that Oo-Mvi exhibit cellular characteristics that fit an exocrine function for signaling communication. We find that deletion of the microvilli-forming gene Radixin in oocytes leads to the loss of Oo-Mvi in ovaries, and causes a series of abnormalities in ovarian development, resulting in shortened reproductive lifespan in females. Mechanistically, we find that Oo-Mvi enrich oocyte-secreted factors and control their release, resulting in optimal selection of ovarian follicles. Taken together, our data show that the Oo-Mvi system controls the female reproductive lifespan by governing the fate of follicles.",

      "title": "Healthy ageing and spermatogenesis.",
      "abstract": "Delayed family planning and increased parental age increase the risk for infertility and impaired offspring health. While the impact of ageing on oogenesis is well studied, this is less understood on spermatogenesis. Assessing ageing effects on the male germline presents a challenge in differentiating between the effects of ageing-associated morbidities, infertility and 'pure' ageing. However, understanding the impact of ageing on male germ cells requires the separation of age from other factors. In this review, we therefore discuss the current knowledge on healthy ageing and spermatogenesis. Male ageing has been previously associated with declining sperm parameters, disrupted hormone secretion and increased time-to-pregnancy, among others. However, recent data show that healthy ageing does not deteriorate testicular function in terms of hormone production and spermatogenic output. In addition, intrinsic, age-dependent, highly specific processes occur in ageing germ cells that are clearly distinct from somatic ageing. Changes in spermatogonial stem cell populations indicate compensation for stem cell exhaustion. Alterations in the stem cell niche and molecular ageing signatures in sperm can be observed in ageing fertile men. DNA fragmentation rates as well as changes in DNA methylation patterns and increased telomere length are hallmarks of ageing sperm. Taken together, we propose a putative link between the re-activation of quiescent Adark spermatogonia and molecular changes in aged sperm descending from these activated spermatogonia. We suggest a baseline of 'pure' age effects in male germ cells which can be used for subsequent studies in which the impact of infertility or co-morbidities will be studied.",

      "title": "Carnitine traffic and human fertility.",
      "abstract": "Carnitine is a vital molecule in human metabolism, prominently involved in fatty acid β-oxidation within mitochondria. Predominantly sourced from dietary intake, carnitine also derives from endogenous synthesis. This review delves into the complex network of carnitine transport and distribution, emphasizing its pivotal role in human fertility. Together with its role in fatty acid oxidation, carnitine modulates the acety-CoA/CoA ratio, influencing carbohydrate metabolism, lipid biosynthesis, and gene expression. The intricate regulation of carnitine homeostasis involves a network of membrane transporters, notably OCTN2, which is central in its absorption, reabsorption, and distribution. OCTN2 dysfunction, results in Primary Carnitine Deficiency (PCD), characterized by systemic carnitine depletion and severe clinical manifestations, including fertility issues. In the male reproductive system, carnitine is crucial for sperm maturation and motility. In the female reproductive system, carnitine supports mitochondrial function necessary for oocyte quality, folliculogenesis, and embryonic development. Indeed, deficiencies in carnitine or its transporters have been linked to asthenozoospermia, reduced sperm quality, and suboptimal fertility outcomes in couples. Moreover, the antioxidant properties of carnitine protect spermatozoa from oxidative stress and help in managing conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis, enhancing sperm viability and fertilization potential of oocytes. This review summarizes the key role of membrane transporters in guaranteeing carnitine homeostasis with a special focus on the implications in fertility and possible treatments of infertility and other related disorders.",

Here, we discuss SGEs that specifically act on sperm to gain a transmission advantage to the next generation. The diverse SGEs that affect sperm often impose costs on carrier males, including damaging ejaculates, skewing offspring sex ratios and in particular reducing sperm-competitive success of SGE-carrying males. How males and females tolerate and mitigate against these costs is a dynamic and expanding area of research. The intense intra-genomic conflict that these selfish elements generate could also have implications for male fertility and spermatogenesis more widely.

Some phthalates are regulated as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and reproductive toxicants based on adverse effects in the male. Potential effects in females are less understood although exposure levels can be higher in women compared to men. Here, we review the literature on the effects of phthalate exposures in adulthood on ovarian function and fertility in women. Experimental studies using cell cultures and rodents combined with human evidence from epidemiological studies suggest that phthalates pose a hazard to ovaries. Phthalates can disrupt follicle growth pattern, increase oxidative stress and cause follicle death. These effects could lead to infertility, faster depletion of ovarian reserve, and earlier reproductive senescence. However, more studies using more realistic exposure levels will be needed to properly assess the risks in women.",

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, advances in cancer therapy have significantly improved survival rates, particularly in childhood cancers. Still, many treatments pose a substantial risk for diminishing future fertility potential due to the gonadotoxic nature of many cancer regimens, justifying fertility preservation programs for both childhood and adult cancer patients. To assure a balance between offering fertility preservation and actual chance of infertility post-treatment, guidelines are in place. However, assessing the actual risk of infertility after treatment remains challenging, given the multi-faceted approach of many cancer treatment plans, which are continuously evolving. This review discusses the evolution of cancer therapy over the past 20 years and attempts to assess their impact on fertility after treatment. Overall, cancer regimens have shifted from broadly killing fast dividing cells to more targeting therapies, reducing collateral damage in general. Although progress has been made to reduce overall toxicity, unfortunately this does not automatically translate to reduced gonadotoxicity. Therefore, current fertility preservation programs continue to be an important part of cancer care.",

In the critically endangered California condor, parentage analysis conducted utilizing polymorphic microsatellite loci has identified two instances of parthenogenetic development from the eggs of two females in the captive breeding program, each continuously housed with a reproductively capable male with whom they had produced offspring. Paternal genetic contribution to the two chicks was excluded. Both parthenotes possessed the expected male ZZ sex chromosomes and were homozygous for all evaluated markers inherited from their dams. These findings represent the first molecular marker-based identification of facultative parthenogenesis in an avian species, notably of females in regular contact with fertile males, and add to the phylogenetic breadth of vertebrate taxa documented to have reproduced via asexual reproduction.",

      "abstract": "A fair shred of evidence supports the mutual relationship between the hypothalamus-pituitary testis axis and the growth hormone (GH) pathway. Nevertheless, the role of GH on male sexual function and fertility is controversial, due to conflicting data from literature. The present review summarizes the available andrological consequences of two pathological extremes, i.e., either GH excess or deficiency. GH excess drives different disorders of male sexual health. On one hand, it indirectly favors the onset of erectile dysfunction (40.2% of cases) mostly by its detrimental vascular and metabolic effects, while testosterone levels don't appear as a key factor. On the other hand, GH excess directly impairs fertility, leading to secondary hypogonadism. Of note, compared to controls, this condition adversely affects the main sperm parameters, i.e., sperm concentration (p = 0.00), progressive motility (p = 0.03), and normal morphology (p = 0.02). Although with limited evidence, GH deficiency also fosters erectile dysfunction, while its effect on fertility is still unclear. On the whole, the available literature shows that any GH disorder plays a negative role in both male general and sexual health. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of testosterone replacement therapy in this population has not yet been explored.",

Further understanding of the benefits and limitations of surgery on future fertility outcomes is essential for those who provide care for patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecologic condition, especially among patients with infertility. Studies demonstrate that, from a fertility perspective, surgery for endometriosis likely has a beneficial impact on the chance of spontaneous conception; however, selecting the appropriate surgical candidate can be challenging. To make a fully informed decision with regard to surgery, it is important to determine the patient's fertility goals and to conduct a thorough workup. Among patients with endometriosis-related infertility, first-line-assisted reproductive technology (ART) is generally preferred over surgery. Specific consideration in cases of minimal or mild endometriosis, ovarian endometrioma(s), and deep endometriosis (DE) are required for targeted counseling. Patients with symptoms significantly impacting their quality of life (QOL), or indications to proceed with surgery (ie, risk of malignancy, organ obstruction, or dysfunction) are best managed with surgical care by an experienced team. Surgery should be considered cautiously given the risks of damage to ovarian reserve, adhesions, and surgical complications. Risk of damage to ovarian reserve is a particularly important consideration among patients with endometrioma(s), with or without low ovarian reserve, and surgical complications are especially prevalent among patients undergoing surgery for bowel endometriosis. Goal-directed surgical treatment, as opposed to the traditional perspective of complete disease eradication, may be of particular importance among selected patients whereby fertility is a priority.",

Molecular biology can provide a substantial source of insight into its causes and potential solutions, particularly through large scale, untargeted omics approaches. In this systematic review, we set out to compile, assess and integrate the latest proteomic and metabolomic research on cow reproduction, specifically that on the female reproductive tract and early embryo. We herein report a general improvement in technical standards throughout the temporal span examined; however, significant methodological limitations are also identified. We propose easily actionable avenues for ameliorating these shortcomings and enhancing the reach of this field. Text mining and pathway analysis corroborate the relevance of proteins and metabolites related to the triad oxidative stress-inflammation-disease on reproductive function. We envisage a breakthrough in cattle reproductive molecular research within the next few years as in vivo sample techniques are improved, omics analysis equipment becomes more affordable and widespread, and software tools for single- and multi-omics data processing are further developed. Additional investigation of the impact of local oxidative stress and inflammation on fertility, both at the local and systemic levels, is key towards realising the full potential of this field.",

      "abstract": "Many recent societal trends have led to the need for fertility education, including the age at which individuals become parents, the development of new reproductive technologies, and family diversity. Fertility awareness has emerged as a concept very recently and is increasingly gaining recognition. However, fertility education is often neglected as there is no consensus on the appropriate content, target populations, or on who should provide it. This article attempts to provide an overview of the use of interventions to improve fertility education. We emphasize the importance of delivering evidence-based information on fertility and reproductive health through various methods while providing guidelines for their standardization and systematization. Recommendations are provided to aid the development and implementation of fertility education tools, including: the establishment of a comprehensive understanding of the target populations; the incorporation of theories of behavioural change; the inclusion of the users' perspectives and the use of participatory research; and the use of specific guidelines for increasing engagement. By following these recommendations, it is expected that fertility education resources can contribute to improving fertility literacy, empowering individuals and couples to make informed reproductive decisions, and ultimately reducing the incidence of infertility and need for fertility treatment.",

Here we review the current literature on boar sperm capacitation as a predictor of boar fertility. While limited, several studies have provided correlations between the percentage of sperm in an ejaculate that are capable of undergoing sperm capacitation in a chemically defined media and artificial insemination field fertility as well as proteome and other methods.

      "abstract": "Extending lactation length reduces the frequency of critical calving events for the cow and herewith reduces the frequency of periods with increased risk for health problems. Moreover, breeding is postponed until a moment later in lactation, which is associated with better conception rates and less days open after start of the breeding period in most studies. Potential risks of an extended lactation are that milk yield of cows at the end of the lactation may be too low which may lead to cows being overconditioned at the end of the extended lactation. Therefore, extending lactation length might not fit every cow. Individual cow characteristics like parity, milk yield level, or body condition determine the response of the cow to an extended lactation. These individual cow characteristics can be used in customized management strategies to optimize lactation length for individual cows. Customized lactation length for individual cows could limit the impact at herd level of disadvantages concerning milk losses and overconditioning and maintain benefits for improved cow health and fertility, reduced number of surplus calves and increased work satisfaction for the farmer. In conclusion, extending lactation length has interesting perspectives for health and fertility of high-producing dairy cows, although questions remain concerning management approaches to support lactation persistency of cows with an extended lactation, and consequences for calf health and development. Moreover, ongoing studies aim to develop decision support tools to select individual cows for a specific lactation length.",

      "title": "Chromosome defects and male factor infertility.",
      "abstract": "Although a routine semen analysis and an endocrine evaluation (usually of the gonadotropins and androgen levels) are the cornerstone of clinical diagnostic evaluation of the male seeking evaluation and treatment of the couple with infertility, in recent years, the American Urological Association/American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Guidelines for Male Infertility stressed the importance of assessing chromosomal anomalies, such as numerical and structural anomalies in men with spermatogenic failure. This narrative review of chromosomal anomalies as a cause of male factor infertility will provide an understanding of the technical approaches to defining the defects, as well as the clinical consequences of these abnormalities for a wider group of men with infertility. Karyotype anomalies are a significant cause of male factor infertility and are present in approximately 6% of men with infertility. These cytogenetic anomalies include numerical defects that underlie conditions such as Klinefelter syndrome, which is among the most overlooked diagnosis in reproductive medicine, and other sex chromosome aneuploidies. Structural chromosomal defects are more varied and complex and include chromosomal translocations, inversions, insertions, and copy number variations, some of which result in spermatogenic failure, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, or even normozoospermia. Other structural defects affect pregnancy outcomes or health of the offspring conceived or cause birth defects. The criteria needed for a chromosomal assessment for the diagnosis male factor infertility should probably be expanded beyond the existing American Urological Association/American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Guidelines. Their recommendation that a karyotype be performed for the evaluation of men with nonobstructive azoospermia and men with severe oligozoospermia (<5 million sperm/mL) is solid; however, the prevalence of cytogenetic anomalies in men with sperm counts below 20 million sperm/mL is also increased compared with fertile men who would not be likely to be tested. Karyotypic anomalies are even present in a subset of men with infertility with normozoospermia. A karyotype can also detect structural chromosomal anomalies, such as translocations that impact male reproductive function and the health of the offspring. Advanced technologies to identify microdeletions and microduplications can also guide patient care. Knowledge of the etiology of the male's infertility may impact the couple's treatment options and improve their reproductive outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Infertility is a global health problem affecting 10-15% of couples in reproductive age. Recent studies have provided growing evidence supporting that lifestyle factors can affect male fertility through alterations in endocrine profiles, spermatogenesis and/or sperm function. One of these critical factors could be the change in the food intake behavior in modern societies that produces metabolic alterations. Regarding this, metabolic syndrome (MetS) prevalence has increased in epidemic in the last 40-50 years. Although MetS is associated with advanced age, changes in lifestyles have accelerated the appearance of symptoms in the reproductive age. We review herein the current understanding of the relationship between MetS and the male reproductive status. For this purpose, in this narrative review a comprehensive literature search was made in both animal models and men, allowing us to evaluate such relationship. This analysis showed a high variability in the reproductive phenotypes observed in patients and mice suffering MetS, including sperm parameters, fertility and offspring health. In view of this, we proposed that the reproductive effects, which are diverse and not robust, observed among MetS-affected males, might depend on additional factors not associated with the metabolic condition and contributed not only by the affected male but also by his partner. With this perspective, this review provides a more accurate insight of this syndrome critical for the identification of specific diagnostic indicators and treatment of MetS-induced fertility disorders.",

      "abstract": "We argue that media-conveyed economic narratives are crucial for understanding contemporary fertility dynamics, net of objective economic constraints. Individuals use these narratives to project themselves into an actionable imagined future and make decisions that may be relatively independent from their actual economic situation. We test this hypothesis for Italy by combining individual-level data from the 2009 and 2016 releases of the nationally representative Family and Social Subjects Survey with Media Tenor data on the coverage of the economy in the evening newscast of Italian TV's most-viewed channel (Rai 1). Our findings reveal that both the incidence and tone of news reports on the state of the economy are associated with fertility behavior. An increase in the number of negative economic news items is negatively associated with fertility, whereas an increase in positive items is positively correlated with fertility. Interestingly, when positive news items outnumber negative ones, an increase in the share of economic reports is positively associated with fertility. These associations are statistically significant and substantially relevant, net of traditional individual and contextual socioeconomic fertility correlates. Overall, our findings bolster the claim that media-conveyed narratives of the economy influence fertility behaviors.",

      "abstract": "The objectives of this Perspective paper are to educate physical therapists on their important role in assessing and treating common pregnancy- and delivery-related health conditions and to advocate for their routine inclusion in postpartum care during the fourth trimester. Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) and diastasis recti abdominis (DRA) are 2 examples of musculoskeletal disorders associated with pregnancy and childbirth that can have negative physical, social, and psychological consequences. This paper reviews evidence from 2010 through 2021 to discuss the efficacy of physical therapist intervention in the fourth trimester for PFD and DRA. The role of physical therapy in the United States is compared with its role in other developed nations, with the intent of illustrating the potential importance of physical therapy in postpartum care. Evidence shows physical therapy is an effective, low-risk, therapeutic approach for PFD and DRA; however, physical therapists in the United States currently have a peripheral role in providing postpartum care. Lack of awareness, social stigma, and policy barriers prevent women from receiving physical therapist care. Recommendations are made regarding ways in which physical therapists can increase their involvement in the fourth trimester within their community, stimulate policy change, and promote improved postpartum care practices.",

      "title": "Evidence-based labor management: postpartum care after vaginal delivery (part 6).",
      "abstract": "In the setting of postpartum care after vaginal delivery, rooming-in is associated with a higher rate of exclusive breastfeeding rate at hospital discharge, but there is insufficient evidence to support or refute rooming-in to increase breastfeeding at 6 months. Education and support for breastfeeding are valuable interventions to promote initiation of breastfeeding whether it is offered by a healthcare professional, nonhealthcare professional, or peer. A combined intervention, a professional provider-led intervention, having a protocol available for the provider training program, and implementation during both the prenatal and postnatal periods increased the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months. There is no single effective treatment for breast engorgement. Breast massage, continuing breastfeeding, and pain relief are recommended by national guidelines. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen are better than placebo for relief of pain caused by uterine cramping and perineal trauma; acetaminophen is effective in breastfeeding individuals who underwent episiotomy; and local cooling pain relievers have been shown to reduce perineal pain for 24 to 72 hours, compared with no treatment. There is insufficient evidence to assess the safety and efficacy of postpartum routine universal thromboprophylaxis after vaginal delivery. Anti-D immune globulin administration is recommended in Rhesus-negative individuals who have given birth to a Rhesus-positive infant. There is very low-quality evidence that a universal complete blood count is useful in reducing the risk of receiving blood products. In the absence of any postpartum complication, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a routine postpartum ultrasound. Measles, mumps, and rubella combination; varicella; human papillomavirus; and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines should be administered in nonimmune individuals in the postpartum period. Smallpox and yellow fever vaccines should be avoided. Individuals undergoing postplacental placement are more likely to use an intrauterine device at 6 months than those advised to follow-up for placement during outpatient postpartum care. An implant is safe and effective for immediate postpartum contraception. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine administration of micronutrient supplements in breastfeeding women. Placentophagia does not provide any benefits and exposes mothers and offspring to infectious risks. Therefore, it should be discouraged. Because of the low level of evidence, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of home visits in the postpartum period. There is insufficient evidence to recommend when to resume daily activities, and individuals should be counseled to return to prepregnancy level of activity or exercise when comfortable. Sexual activity, housework exercise, driving, climbing stairs, and lifting weights should be resumed as soon as postpartum individuals want. A behavioral educational intervention reduces depression symptoms and increases breastfeeding duration. Physical activity after delivery is protective against postpartum mood disorders. There is no strong evidence that supports early discharge after vaginal delivery compared with standard discharge (ie, ≥48 hours).",

Yet the prioritization of disease surveillance, management, and mitigation during birth and beyond within the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology facilitates the medicalization and pathologization of Black bodies, voices, and power. Thus, we offer the Building and Bridging Black Futures Beyond Birth Model: A 12-Step Black Woman-Person First Approach, as a more humane and holistic model of culturally affirming and clinically responsive care. Destigmatizing and democratizing care bridges the gap between intent and impact in postpartum care optimization, particularly for Black women, girls, and gender expansive people and their communities.",

      "title": "Postpartum care: Clinical considerations for improving genital and sexual health.",
      "abstract": "The postpartum period encompasses the biological and psychoaffective transition to motherhood. However, it remains a most neglected phase in a woman's life. Furthermore, the transition to parenthood is a critical and potentially disrupting factor in a couple's relationship, which can be complicated by undiagnosed biological and psychosexual difficulties. Lack of recognition of the many biological and medical factors that can affect women's health and sexuality in the postpartum period is a common and persistent clinical omission worldwide. Communication difficulties exist between healthcare professionals and women and there are wording biases in describing female genitalia. This can further contribute to the diagnostic lack of attention and timely diagnosis and treatment of even very bothersome symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment of common postpartum conditions is vital and quality care for new mothers should include psychological and emotional support, lactation assistance, early diagnosis and treatment of genital and sexual pain symptoms, pelvic floor rehabilitation and sexual health guidance. The inclusion of correct genital hygiene practices is a critical element of postpartum gynaecological counselling and can help improve overall genital and sexual health. In this review, we summarise the variability in global professional guidelines for postpartum care, identify common health problems faced by postpartum women and discuss appropriate postpartum care. We pay specific attention to prominent biological or medical factors that can impact the emotional and psychosexual wellbeing of women and couples. The aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunction, in particular sexual pain disorders, is therefore discussed with a pragmatic approach. Finally, the role of intimate hygiene care is discussed with special attention given to cleanser ingredients with solid scientific evidence to help clinicians adopt a more tailored approach with their clinical recommendations.",

      "abstract": "The immediate postpartum period carries significant risks for complications such as postpartum hemorrhage and sepsis. Postpartum monitoring, including taking vital signs and monitoring blood loss, is important for the early identification and management of complications, but many women in low- and middle-income countries receive minimal attention in the period following childbirth to facility discharge. The World Health Organization recently released new guidelines on postnatal care, which include recommendations for immediate postpartum monitoring. In light of the new guidelines, this presented an opportune moment to address the gaps in postpartum monitoring in low- and middle-income countries. In this commentary, we bring attention to the importance of immediate postpartum monitoring. We identified opportunities for strengthening this often overlooked aspect of maternity care through improvements in quality measurement and data availability, research into barriers against high-quality care, and innovations in service delivery design.",

      "title": "Postpartum and interpregnancy care of women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are common complications associated with maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Insights gained from long-term cohort studies have revealed that women with a history of HDP are predisposed to recurrent HDP in subsequent pregnancies and face heightened risks for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases later in life. Pregnancy is a unique condition that overloads maternal cardiac and metabolic functions, and is recognized as a \"maternal stress test\" for future cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Pregnancy and postpartum period provide a valuable opportunity for identifying women with underlying and unrecognized cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors. Establishing an effective postpartum healthcare program for women who have experienced HDP is crucial in reducing the future risk of health complications. Postpartum care consists of supportive care for both mothers and children, including not only the assessment of physical and psychological well-being but also long-term postpartum preventive health management. Interpregnancy care is a continuum from postpartum care and includes supportive care to prepare for future pregnancies. Various initiatives across nations have been initiated to establish follow-up programs for women with a history of HDP; however, sufficient evidence of the impact of such programs is not available. Substantial challenges persist in establishing an efficient postpartum follow-up program, including educational strategies, selection of effective lifestyle interventions, and collaboration among various healthcare providers. This review outlines the postpartum and interpregnancy care of women who have experienced HDP as well as the current status and challenges of related healthcare initiatives in Japan.",

      "abstract": "In the weeks after childbirth, a woman navigates multiple challenges. She must recover from birth, learn to care for herself and her newborn, and cope with fatigue and postpartum mood changes as well as chronic health conditions. Alongside these common morbidities, the number of maternal deaths in the United States continues to increase, and unacceptable racial inequities persist. One third of pregnancy-related deaths occur between 1 week and 1 year after delivery, with a growing proportion of these deaths due to cardiovascular disease; one fifth occur between 7 and 42 days postpartum. In addition, pregnancy-associated deaths due to self-harm or substance misuse are increasing at an alarming rate. Rising maternal mortality and morbidity rates, coupled with significant disparities in outcomes, highlight the need for tailored interventions to improve safety and well-being of families during the fourth trimester of pregnancy, which includes the period from birth to the comprehensive postpartum visit. Targeted support for growing families during this transition can improve health and well-being across generations.",

However, the long-term renewal potential of NSCs and their mode of division remain elusive. The use of advanced in vivo live imaging approaches may expand our knowledge of NSC physiology and provide new information for cell replacement therapies. In this Review, we discuss the in vivo imaging methods used to study NSC dynamics and recent live-imaging results with respect to specific intracellular pathways that allow NSCs to integrate and decode different micro-environmental signals. Lastly, we discuss future directions that may provide answers to unresolved questions regarding NSC physiology.",

This gap perpetuates a cycle of disappointment with and disengagement from postpartum care services. The need to revamp postpartum care has been recognized at the population level but implementing changes at the health care provider level is challenging without practical guidance. The needs of new mothers are broad in scope and variable between individuals, requiring a whole-person care approach that is comprehensive yet nimble. Presented here are provider-level strategies to promote care that both elicits and is responsive to the unique care goals of this population.",

Beyond the potentially devastating impact of APOs during pregnancy and the puerperium, women diagnosed with APOs have a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of future cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, APOs occur at an opportune time, in early-adulthood to mid-adulthood, when primary and secondary prevention strategies can alter the disease trajectory and improve long-term health outcomes. This chapter takes a life-course approach to (1) the epidemiology of APOs, (2) evidence-based strategies for clinicians to manage APOs, and (3) future directions for APO research and clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "The menopause transition is usually a gradual process occurring over many years, caused by the cessation of ovarian reproductive function, resulting in the end of menstrual bleeding. In the peri-menopause, ovarian function and therefore the production of the hormones oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone can fluctuate greatly, leading to a wide variety of symptoms, affecting multiple organ systems. Menopause and the management of its associated symptoms can be very challenging for patients and clinicians alike and can negatively impact quality of life. The management options include lifestyle adjustment, talking therapies, dietary supplements as well as prescribed medications, including hormone replacement therapy. The UK's average life expectancy for women is approximately 81 years. Therefore, women will now live up to a third of their life being either peri- or postmenopausal. Thus, understanding and treating, where possible, the symptoms of menopause is essential to reduce the burden associated with this physiological state.",

Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is a major life event that can affect women in several ways. Its onset marks the end of the reproductive life cycle, and its impact can be both short and long term. Menopause is often a gradual process, preceded by a transitional period known as perimenopause. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51. The clinical manifestations of menopause result from the eventual exhaustion of oocytes within the ovaries. This leads to a chronic hypo-estrogenic state, which in the short term causes menopausal symptoms and over a long term, has an impact on bone and cardiovascular health. There has been a steep drop in the prescription of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) following the publication of the Women's Health Initiative Study and the Million Women Study. It is currently estimated that approximately a million women in the UK are taking HRT for control of their menopausal symptoms. This review summarises the current recommendations for HRT use in menopausal women. The benefits of HRT in improving the symptoms of menopause are discussed as well as the potential role of HRT in managing long-term sequelae is covered. Evidence pertaining to the potential risks associated with HRT is also be reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The menopausal transition is associated with an increased frequency of sleep disturbances. Insomnia represents one of the most reported symptoms by menopausal women. According to its pathogenetic model (3-P Model), different predisposing factors (i.e. a persistent condition of past insomnia and aging per se) increase the risk of insomnia during menopause. Moreover, multiple precipitating and perpetuating factors should favor its occurrence across menopause, including hormonal changes, menopausal transition stage symptoms (i.e. hot flashes, night sweats), mood disorders, poor health and pain, other sleep disorders and circadian modifications. Thus, insomnia management implies a careful evaluation of the psychological and somatic symptoms of the individual menopausal woman by a multidisciplinary team. Therapeutic strategies encompass different drugs but also behavioral interventions. Indeed, cognitive behavioral therapy represents the first-line treatment of insomnia in the general population, regardless of the presence of mood disorders and/or vasomotor symptoms (VMS). Different antidepressants seem to improve sleep disturbances. However, when VMS are present, menopausal hormone therapy should be considered in the treatment of related insomnia taking into account the risk-benefit profile. Finally, given its good tolerability, safety, and efficacy on multiple sleep and daytime parameters, prolonged-released melatonin should represent a first-line drug in women aged ≥ 55 years.",

      "abstract": "The totality of evidence indicates menopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) effects are determined by timing of initiation according to age and/or time since menopause, underlying health of target tissue, and duration of therapy. Initiated in women at younger than 60 years and/or at or near menopause, HRT significantly reduces all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD), whereas other primary CVD prevention therapies such as lipid-lowering fail to do so. The magnitude and type of HRT-associated risks, including breast cancer, stroke, and venous thromboembolism, are rare (<10 events/10,000 women), not unique to HRT, and comparable with other medications. Hormone replacement therapy is a sex-specific and time-dependent primary CVD prevention therapy that concomitantly reduces all-cause mortality, as well as other aging-related diseases with an excellent risk profile. Keeping in mind that prevention strategies must be personalized, health care providers and patients can use cumulated HRT data in making clinical decisions concerning chronic disease prevention including CVD and mortality reduction.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive and mood changes are frequently mentioned as complaints before, during and after menopausal transition. There is substantial biological evidence for such associations to occur, as there are many mechanisms through which oestrogens can affect the brain: by regulating metabolism, increasing cerebral blood flow and dendritic outgrowth, by acting on nerve growth factors through the co-localisation of receptors via neurotransmitter synthesis and turnover and many more. However, the evidence for objective and longer-term changes in cognitive function and mental health over the menopausal transition and beyond is less clear. While hormone treatment (HT) including oestrogens could potentially reverse these psychological issues, the evidence of long-term benefit is also inconclusive. However, for women with severe menopausal complaints, and particularly for those who undergo early menopause, including women with premature ovarian insufficiency, personalised HT at least up to the natural age of menopause around 50 should be considered, which is probably safe up to 10 years of treatment, unless contraindicated. This paper reviews the evidence for changes in psychological health related to menopausal transition and HTs.",

      "abstract": "Menopausal symptoms are associated with deterioration in physical, mental, and sexual health, lowering women's quality of life (QoL). Our study objective is to examine the effect of exercise on QoL in women with menopausal symptoms. After initially identifying 1306 studies published on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library before June 2020, two researchers independently selected nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which any type of exercise was compared with no active treatment. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool for RCTs and computed the converged standardized mean difference with a 95% confidence interval. We found evidences for the positive effects of exercise on physical and psychological QoL scores in women with menopausal symptoms. However, there was no evidence for the effects of exercise on general, social, and menopause-specific QoL scores. The most common interventions for women with menopausal and urinary symptoms were yoga and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), respectively. In our meta-analyses, while yoga significantly improved physical QoL, its effects on general, psychological, sexual, and vasomotor symptoms QoL scores as well as the effect of PFMT on general QoL were not significant. Our findings suggest that well-designed studies are needed to confirm the effect of exercise on QoL in women with menopausal symptoms.",

Since the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial results in 2002, including post-intervention analysis and cumulative 18-year follow up, it has become clear that the risks of HT are low for healthy women less than age 60 or within ten years from menopause. For those who are experiencing bothersome vasomotor symptoms, the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks in view of HT's efficacy for symptom management. HT also has a role in preventing osteoporosis in appropriate candidates for treatment.

A significant number of women experience mental ill health related to the major brain gonadal hormone shifts that occur in their midlife. There is poor understanding and management of the complex mental ill health issues, with the biological brain hormone changes receiving little formal attention. The current treatment advice is to manage this special type of mental ill health in the same way that all mental ill health is managed. This leads to poor outcomes for women and their families. Many women leave the workforce earlier than expected due to menopause-related depression and anxiety, with subsequent loss of salary and superannuation. Others describe being unable to adequately parent or maintain meaningful relationships - all ending in a poor quality of life. We are a large and diverse group of national and international clinicians, lived experience and social community advocates, all working together to innovate the current approaches available for women with menopausal mental ill health. Above all, true innovation is only possible when the woman with lived experience of menopause is front and centre of this debate.",

Usually occurring between 42 and 52 years of age, it is determined clinically by the onset of irregular menstrual cycles or variable cycle lengths. Women are at an increased risk of depression and anxiety during perimenopause and the menopausal transition. Depressive symptoms experienced in perimenopause are often more severe compared to pre- and post-menopause. During menopausal transition, the impact of fluctuating estrogen in the central nervous system (CNS) can have negative psychological effects for some women. Traditional first-line management of menopausal depression involves antidepressants, with modest outcomes. The positive effects of estrogen treatment in the CNS are becoming increasingly recognised, and hormonal therapy (HT) with estrogen may have a role in the treatment of menopausal depression. In this review we will outline the prevalence, impact and neurochemical basis of menopausal-associated depression, as well as hormone-based approaches that have increasing promise as effective treatments.",

      "abstract": "The shift in paradigm from the belief that endometriosis exclusively affects women of reproductive age has brought attention to its manifestation in postmenopausal patients. Despite this emerging awareness, there remains a dearth of information in the literature regarding postmenopausal endometriosis, with uncertainties surrounding its prevalence, clinical significance, optimal management strategies, and prognosis. Clinical manifestations of endometriosis in menopausal patients lack specificity, with pain onset possible at any stage of life. The primary approach for symptomatic postmenopausal endometriosis continues to be surgical excision, serving both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes while mitigating the risk of coexisting malignancies. Managing the disease in postmenopausal women presents challenges due to possible contraindications for menopausal hormone therapy and the elevated risk of recurrence and malignant transformation. However, conclusive data regarding the appropriateness of menopausal hormone therapy in women with endometriosis or a history of the disease are lacking. Current recommendations lean towards prioritizing combined menopausal hormone therapy formulations or tibolone over estrogen-only therapies due to their potentially higher malignancy risk. The possible increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with endometriosis is likely linked to a history of surgical menopause at an earlier age, but more research is warranted. This narrative review summarizes the available literature and provides insights into the intricate connection between endometriosis and menopause, shedding light on pathogenesis, symptoms, oncologic risk, diagnosis, and treatment.",

In this paper, we examined the characteristics and possible mechanisms of immune imbalance caused by decreased estrogen levels during menopause and found that estrogen deficiency disrupted immune homeostasis, especially the levels of inflammatory cytokines through the ERα/ERβ/GPER-associated NLRP3/NF-κB signaling pathways. We also analyzed the destruction of the blood-brain barrier, dysfunction of neurotransmitters, blockade of BDNF synthesis, and attenuation of neuroplasticity caused by inflammatory cytokine activity, and investigated estrogen-immuno-neuromodulation disorders in menopausal depression. Current research suggests that drugs targeting inflammatory cytokines and NLRP3/NF-κB signaling molecules are promising for restoring homeostasis of the estrogen-immuno-neuromodulation system and may play a positive role in the intervention and treatment of menopausal depression.",

      "title": "Pain during menopause.",
      "abstract": "Menopause is a biological process marking the end of a woman's reproductive years, typically occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. While often associated with hot flashes, mood swings, and hormonal changes, pain is a frequently overlooked and under-addressed aspect of the menopausal experience. This review article explores the multifaceted nature of pain during menopause, and sheds light on its various manifestations and the factors contributing to its prevalence and severity. Pain during menopause may include musculoskeletal discomfort, headaches or migraines, and vulvovaginal pain. The etiology of these is intricate, involving hormonal fluctuations, psychosocial factors, and genetic predispositions. Fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone levels play a pivotal role in musculoskeletal pain and joint stiffness, and increase susceptibility to conditions such as osteoarthritis. Furthermore, mood disorders, stress, and sleep disturbances may exacerbate the perception of pain. Gender norms, as well as changes in reproductive capacity and societal views on aging, may adversely the impact the self-esteem of individuals undergoing menopause. These symptoms can significantly impact a woman's quality of life, underscoring the need for early identification and appropriate management strategies. This review article highlights the factors contributing to pain during menopause, evaluates the effects of hormones on menopausal pain, and investigates management strategies for pain during menopause, including both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. It also emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the interplay of factors contributing to pain during menopause, in order to allow for more tailored and effective interventions. In understanding and addressing this often-neglected aspect of menopause, healthcare providers can enhance the overall wellbeing and quality of life for women transitioning through this natural life stage.",

      "abstract": "The peri-menopause or menopausal transition-the time period that surrounds the final years of a woman's reproductive life-is associated with profound reproductive and hormonal changes in a woman's body and exponentially increases a woman's risk of cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer's disease. Although our understanding of the exact timeline or definition of peri-menopause is limited, it is clear that there are two stages to the peri-menopause. These are the early menopausal transition, where menstrual cycles are mostly regular, with relatively few interruptions, and the late transition, where amenorrhea becomes more prolonged and lasts for at least 60 days, up to the final menstrual period. Emerging evidence is showing that peri-menopause is pro-inflammatory and disrupts estrogen-regulated neurological systems. Estrogen is a master regulator that functions through a network of estrogen receptors subtypes alpha (ER-α) and beta (ER-β). Estrogen receptor-beta has been shown to regulate a key component of the innate immune response known as the inflammasome, and it also is involved in regulation of neuronal mitochondrial function. This review will present an overview of the menopausal transition as an inflammatory event, with associated systemic and central nervous system inflammation, plus regulation of the innate immune response by ER-β-mediated mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Postmenopausal women represent an important target population in need of preventative cardiometabolic approaches. The loss of estrogen following the menopause eliminates protections against metabolic dysfunction, largely due to its role in the health and function of adipose tissue. In addition, some studies associate the menopause with reduced physical activity, which could potentially exacerbate the deleterious cardiometabolic risk profile accompanying the menopause. Meanwhile, exercise has adipocyte-specific effects that may alleviate the adverse impact of estrogen loss through the menopausal transition period and beyond. Exercise thus remains the best therapeutic agent available to mitigate menopause-associated metabolic dysfunction and represents a vital behavioral strategy to prevent and alleviate health decline in this population.",

      "abstract": "Menopause eventually happens to all people with typically functioning ovaries, and almost one billion women worldwide are postmenopausal. Although the biology of typical menopause is ubiquitous, the experience varies substantially. Factors contributing to the experience include not only individual factors, such as the nature and severity of symptoms, but also psychological, social, and contextual considerations, many of which are modifiable. In this first paper in the Lancet Series on menopause, we argue for a new approach that goes beyond the treatment of specific symptoms, to encompass a broad model to support women transitioning this life stage, using the model of empowerment. WHO defines empowerment as an active process of gaining knowledge, confidence, and self-determination to self-manage health and make informed decisions about care. Rather than focusing on menopause as an endocrine deficiency, we propose an empowerment model that recognises factors modifying the experience, in which the patient is an expert in their own condition and the health-care worker supports the patient to become an equal and active partner in managing their own care.",

This review delves into the effects of estrogen deficiency during the perimenopausal transition and postmenopause, integrating the findings of basic science with clinical trials. Here, we first outline the variation in endogenous estrogens before and after menopause, exploring both genomic and nongenomic actions of estrogen and its estrogen receptors throughout the body. Next, we detail the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, from acute vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological issues during perimenopause to chronic reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, skeletal, dermatologic, immune, and digestive changes postmenopause. Finally, we evaluate the role of hormone therapy in alleviating these symptoms, weighing its benefits against known risks. Publicizing these findings and an accurate representation of the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement to our aging patients is fundamental to improving their care, quality, and even quantity of life.",

Nutrients and bioactive molecules supplied to the body with food are metabolized using various enzymatic pathways.

In this review, we analyzed the literature data from the last 5 years, especially regarding genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, and selected molecular factors and cell signaling pathways that may potentially be related to hot flashes in women. These are the kisspeptin-GnRH pathway, adipocyte-derived hormones, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling, catechol estrogens and estrogen sulfotransferase, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, and glucose availability. Then, single compounds or groups of food ingredients were selected that, according to experimental data, influence the course of the discussed molecular pathways and thus can be considered as potential natural therapeutic agents to effectively reduce the troublesome symptoms of menopause in women.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is a physiological change in any woman. Nevertheless, its symptoms could be difficult to accept, and hormone therapy can be sometimes unattractive or contraindicated. Vitamin E components are phytoestrogens, so they are believed to be useful in some indications including menopause. This review aimed to assess the available evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin E in alleviating menopausal symptoms. The Pubmed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases were screened. All types of studies that assessed the effectiveness of vitamin E in alleviating menopausal symptoms were included. The PICO question was: \"How does vitamin E supplementation affect menopausal symptom occurrence?\" The PROSPERO ID number of this review is CRD42022328830. After quality assessment, 16 studies were included in the analysis. The studies were divided into three groups in which the influence of vitamin E on the genital syndrome of menopause, vasomotor symptoms and vascular and metabolic changes were assessed. Vitamin E influences postmenopausal hot flashes, vascular modulation, plasma lipid profile level and vaginal changes. Compared to vitamin E, estrogen administration leads to better clinical effects. Nevertheless, vitamin E might serve as additive to hormone therapy and its alternative in women with contraindications to estrogens. More quality data are necessary to draw final conclusions.",

      "abstract": "A systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted to establish the impact of menopause health education on quality of life (QoL) among menopausal women. Research suggests that specific educational programs can support and enable women during the physical and emotional transition through menopause. The CINAHL, Medline, APA, Embase and Google Scholar databases were searched between 30 November 2021 and 9 January 2022 using the PRISMA guidelines. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to critically evaluate the included studies. Review Manager software was used to conduct the meta-analysis of suitable studies. Eight papers were eligible for this review. The participants were aged between 40 and 60 years, with diagnosis of menopause stemming from changes in the menstrual cycle to a last menstrual period of 7 years. Follow-up data were collected between 1 and 4 months post education. Meta-analysis of both the primary outcome (QoL) and secondary outcome (symptom control) demonstrated statistically significant improvements post intervention. Papers not suitable for meta-analysis were reviewed narratively; two papers assessing the primary outcome (QoL) demonstrated an improvement, but only one to a statistically significant level. Secondary outcomes revealed improvements, with all bar one paper doing so to statistical significance. Menopause health education demonstrated an improvement in both QoL and symptom control in menopausal women; however, given some weaknesses in the included studies, further research is justified. Limitations include participants' level of education, geographical location, risk of bias, that only half of the papers addressed participant use of hormone replacement therapy and length of follow-up.",

      "abstract": "The menopause transition is an important period in a woman's life, during which she is at an increased risk of mood disorders. Estrogen and progesterone fluctuations during the menopausal transition and very low levels of estradiol after menopause have a profound effect on the central nervous system (CNS), causing an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Changes in neurotransmission and neuronal interactions that occur with estradiol withdrawal disrupt the normal neurological balance and may be associated with menopausal symptoms. Hot flushes, depressed mood and anxiety are all symptoms of menopause that are a consequence of the complex changes that occur in the CNS, involving many signaling pathways and neurotransmitters (i.e. γ-aminobutyric acid, serotonin, dopamine), neurosteroids (i.e. allopregnanolone), and neuropeptides (i.e. kisspeptin, neurokinin B). All these pathways are closely linked, and the complex interactions that exist are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the neuroendocrine changes in the CNS during the menopausal transition, with particular emphasis on those that underlie mood changes.",

Estrogenic activity is present mostly in the brain, vagina, and bone, while the inactive forms predominate in the endometrium and breast. Conflicting literature on TIB's actions has been observed. While it has benefits for vasomotor symptoms, bone demineralization, and sexual health, a higher relative risk of hormone-sensitive cancer has been reported. In the brain, TIB can improve mood and cognition, neuroinflammation, and reactive gliosis. This review aims to discuss the systemic effects of TIB on peri- and post-menopausal women and its role in the brain.

      "abstract": "This narrative review discusses the current understanding, knowledge gaps and challenges in expanding our knowledge of the association between menopause and the reproductive aging process and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) in women, with a focus on type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The physiological changes that occur at different stages of the reproductive life span, as well as type of menopause and timing, are factors widely associated with CMD risk; however, the underlying mechanisms remain either unclear or insufficiently studied. Decreased ovarian estrogen production and relative androgen excess around menopause onset are the most studied factors linking menopause and cardiometabolic health; nevertheless, the evidence is not persuasive and other hypotheses might explain the changes in CMD risk during menopausal transition. In this context, hormone therapy has been widely adopted in the treatment and prevention of CMD, although uncertainty regarding its cardiometabolic effects has raised the need to optimize therapeutic modalities. Mechanisms such as the \"iron overload theory\" and new \"omics\" platforms could provide new insights into potential pathways underlying the association between menopause and cardiometabolic health, such as the DNA damage response. Although it has been widely reported that environmental and lifestyle factors affect both menopause and cardiometabolic health, there is little evidence on the role of these exposures in menopause-associated CMD risk.",

      "abstract": "Menopause marks the end of menstrual cyclicity and, depending on individual vulnerability, has several consequences related to gonadal steroid deprivation, especially if it is premature. Menopause may be more burdensome for some women than for others. Individual factors, such as personal history, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and current health conditions, affect symptomatology and, thereby, the menopausal experience. In addition, some menopausal symptoms, such as severe hot flashes, sleep disorders, and depression, are markers of future health risks. Counseling is a fundamental part of health care in the peri- and postmenopause periods. It must include an assessment of the patient's symptoms, needs, desires, and risk profile to address the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) on an individual basis and promote a healthy lifestyle. Indeed, healthcare practitioners can and must protect the health and lives of mid-life women by increasing awareness of menopausal symptoms and ensuring healthcare options, especially MHT. The type and duration of MHT should be tailored based on the patient's history, menopausal age, physical characteristics, and current health status so that the benefits always outweigh the risks. This FIGO position paper focuses on the benefits and risks of MHT on health domains, target organs, and systems, and on systemic and vaginal MHT regimens, to provide indications that can be used in the clinical practice for menopausal counseling. Moreover, it offers insights into what FIGO considers the mainstay for the healthcare management of women in peri- and postmenopause, worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Menopause has far-reaching effects on human physiology, including the gastrointestinal tract, and can negatively influence the quality of life of women who are affected. Menopause can have multiple effects on gastrointestinal function, including altering gut motility and changing the composition of the gut microbiota. As a result, some gastrointestinal and hepatic conditions are more common among individuals in peri- and postmenopause, and people with these conditions before menopause might also experience greater symptom severity and worse health-related quality of life during this time. The use of hormone replacement therapy to treat menopausal symptoms might also affect gastrointestinal health and well-being. Individuals in postmenopause are at risk for bone remodelling and osteoporosis due to ageing and loss of sex hormones. However, secondary osteoporosis can also occur due to medications used to treat gastrointestinal conditions (for example, glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications) and the conditions themselves (for example, autoimmune disease or coeliac disease). Although all people who menstruate will eventually transition to menopause, there are relatively few studies evaluating the effect of menopause on gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life. This Review aims to summarize available evidence and highlight areas where research is needed.",

      "abstract": "The huge impact of climate change on humankind is multidimensional, and includes direct and indirect challenges to the physical, psychological and socio-cultural wellbeing. Women may be more vulnerable to climate-sensitive diseases, but little attention has been paid to specific needs and challenges associated with the menopause transition. The increase in average and extreme temperatures may modulate the manifestation of vasomotor symptoms; in particular, environmental temperature and seasonality may affect hot flushes and night sweats. However, more research is needed to define the impact of climate-related factors among the determinants influencing the individual experience of menopause. In addition, increased exposure to environmental pollution and toxins may also have a role in the modulation of ovarian aging mechanisms, possibly influencing timing of menopause. Finally, both air pollution and menopause transition are associated with unfavorable modifications of cardio-metabolic, bone and cognitive health, and account should be taken of these in the evaluation of the individual woman's health vulnerabilities. Overall, the evidence reported in this narrative review supports the need for specific strategies aimed at reducing the burden of climate and environmental change on menopausal women. Healthcare providers should promote behavioral measures that reduce anthropogenic climate change and at the same time have a beneficial role on several domains of physical and psychological wellbeing. From this perspective, menopause represents a golden moment to implement virtuous behaviors that will benefit at the same time women's longevity and the planet.",

      "abstract": "The menopause experience is unique to people with ovaries who attain an age at which functioning follicles are depleted. Unlike male reproductive aging, menopause is accompanied by a definable reproductive milestone in that menstrual periods cease and the failure of follicle growth results in a large drop in circulating estrogen and no further ovarian production of progesterone. While the focus on menopause has largely been centered on this absence of hormone production, the most dynamic changes in symptoms and health markers begin before the final menstrual period, and merit attention. Vasomotor symptoms, the most common symptom of menopause and the primary symptom that drives women to seek treatment, peak in frequency and prevalence in the late menopause transition, when women are still having menstrual periods. Body composition and adverse lipoprotein and lipid changes also worsen most acutely in the late transition, and then assume a slower, age-related trajectory of change. Multiple processes that worsen across the transition restabilize after it is over. The notion that the menopause transition is an adaptive process for women has scientific merit and suggests that facilitating this adaptation and recognizing its implications may represent the next phase of progress in the field.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder become episodically manifest during the second half of the female menstrual cycle and are characterized by psychological and physical symptoms causing relevant functional and social impairments. Mood swings, depression and dysphoria are associated depressive symptoms. Therefore, affective disorders should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Of women in reproductive age 3-8% suffer from premenstrual syndrome and 2% of women are affected by premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Genetic and sociobiographical risk factors are discussed. Furthermore, genetic polymorphisms of specific hormone receptors are considered to be genetic risk factors. From a pathophysiological perspective premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder are caused by a complex interaction between cyclic changes of ovarian steroids and central neurotransmitters. An imbalance of estrogen and progesterone in the luteal phase is believed to cause the symptoms. Therefore, the first treatment approach consists of regulation of the menstrual cycle or luteal support with progesterone or synthetic progestins even if their effectiveness has not yet been proven in randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses. The administration of combined oral contraceptives is also an option. Especially treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) represent an evidence-based approach. In severe cases the administration of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists with add back treatment can also be considered. In the field of affective disorders premenstrual syndromes represent clinically relevant differential diagnoses and comorbidities, which confront the treating physician with particular clinical challenges. Therefore, this literature review gives the readership a clinical orientation for dealing with these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are common disorders of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and are characterized by moderate to severe physical, affective, or behavioral symptoms that impair daily activities and quality of life. PMS and PMDD have recently raised great interest in the research community for their considerable global prevalence. The etiology of PMS/PMDD is complex. Ovarian reproductive steroids (estradiol and progesterone) are considered pathogenetic effectors, but the key feature seems to be an altered sensitivity of the GABAergic central inhibitory system to allopregnanolone, a neurosteroid derived from progesterone produced after ovulation. Also, a reduced availability of serotonin seems to be involved. New insights point to a role for genetic and epigenetic modifications of hormonal and neurotransmitter pathways, and inflammation is the potential link between peripheral and neurological integrated responses to stressors. Thus, new therapeutic approaches to PMS/PMDD include inhibition of progesterone receptors in the brain (i.e., with ulipristal acetate), reduced conversion of progesterone to its metabolite allopregnanolone with dutasteride, and possible modulation of the action of allopregnanolone on the brain GABAergic system with sepranolone. Further research is needed to better understand the interaction between peripheral inflammatory molecules (cytokines, interleukins, C-reactive protein, and reactive oxygen species) and the brain neurotransmitter systems in women with PMS/PMDD. If confirmed, neuroinflammation could lead both to develop targeted anti-inflammatory therapies and to define prevention strategies for the associated chronic inflammatory risk in PMS/PMDD. Finally, the observed association between premenstrual disorders and psychological diseases may guide prompt and adequate interventions to achieve a better quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common disorders faced by women of reproductive age. More than 200 symptoms of varying severity associated with PMS have been identified. Because of the broad spectrum of action of PMS and its impact on quality of life, symptom relief is the main challenge of treating PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). The review aims to analyze and identify the potential impact of dietary and nutritional therapies on PMS and, respectively, for its better management. The study was conducted by accessing Internet databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus and using relevant keywords such as PMS, symptoms, dietary patterns (DPs), macro and micronutrients, and supplements. The results showed that diet is an essential modulating factor in reducing and managing PMS symptoms. But research on the actual effect of foods and nutrients on PMS is sparse, sporadic, and studied with insufficient scientific rigor. No correlations were identified between the consumption of macronutrients and PMS: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber, but the effectiveness of micronutrients, especially calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, B vitamins, and herbal supplements, was demonstrated. Researchers remain unanimous that the evidence is insufficient and limited to support their use as an effective treatment. Nevertheless, the results could contribute to providing quality information to help women and girls make evidence-based decisions regarding premenstrual health and the adoption of dietary and nutritional therapies.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a disorder between gynecology and psychiatry which includes cognitive, affective, and somatic symptoms from mild to severe. The most severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and it is considered a form of depressive disorder. An association between diet composition and the occurrence of PMS and its severity have been suggested. As such, this manuscript discusses the relationships between diet composition, dietary patterns and eating behaviors, and PMS. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases were searched for related studies up to 18 January 2024. A text search with the following keywords singly or in combination was conducted: \"Premenstrual syndrome\", \"Nutrition\", \"Diet composition\", \"Dietary patterns\", and \"Eating behaviors\". Studies published so far showed that low intake of simple carbohydrates, fats, salt, and alcohol, and high of fresh, unprocessed foods rich in B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids may help prevent the onset of PMS and reduce the severity of its symptoms. However, further studies are needed to formulate definitive recommendations for the use of vitamins, micronutrients and other dietary ingredients supplementation in women with PMS to improve functioning, overall well-being, and physical health. Large, randomized, double-blind clinical trials across diverse populations are necessary to formulate clear recommendations for supplementation in women with PMS.",

GABA conductance and changes in neurosteroid levels, particularly allopregnanolone, are suspected to play a substantial role in the disorder's etiology. In this paper, we provide an overview of recent reports on the etiology and recognized therapeutic approaches, encompassing both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Our examination includes studies on SSRIs, hormonal agents, neurosteroids, supplementation, and therapeutic roles. We aim to determine the most favorable treatment regimen by comparing medication effects and alternative methods. The treatment of PMS is crucial for enhancing the quality of life for affected women. Medications used in PMS treatment should be individually selected to achieve the best therapeutic effect, considering the clinical situation of the patients.",

This study focuses on defining and diagnosing premenstrual disorders, distinguishing between premenstrual symptoms (PS), PMS, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It highlights the prevalence of these conditions and their impact on women's quality of life, including social, occupational, and psychological aspects. Furthermore, the study examines the role of physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, in managing premenstrual symptoms. Several systematic reviews are cited, suggesting that regular physical activity can effectively reduce both physical and psychological symptoms associated with PMS. In conclusion, the management of PMS involves a multifaceted approach, with exercises, dietary modifications, stress management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and medications all playing roles. Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, has been found to be an effective non-pharmacological therapy for alleviating PMS symptoms and improving overall well-being. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal type and dosage of exercise for individual women with PMS.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) represent two premenstrual disorders characterized by physical and psychological symptoms that occur in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, prior to the onset of menses, and have a negative impact on the psychosocial functioning of affected individuals. PMS, more common than PMDD, affects 20-40% of menstruating women, with common symptoms including fatigue, irritability, mood swings, depression, abdominal bloating, breast tenderness, acne, changes in appetite and food cravings. PMDD, affecting a smaller percentage of women, is characterized by more severe symptoms and is listed as a depressive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). While the pathophysiology of these premenstrual disorders remains unclear, it has been hypothesized that sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, abnormal serotonergic activity, and aberrations in progesterone and the neurotransmitter gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) may all play a role in these disorders. Treatment of PMS and PMDD is focused on alleviation of symptoms and improvement of functioning and quality of life for affected individuals. The treatment of severe PMS and PMDD typically requires pharmacologic therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and non-contraceptive estrogen formulations. Non-pharmacologic treatment with diet, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), certain vitamin and herbal supplements, and acupuncture may additionally be effective for some individuals.",

The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive review on progesterone, and its metabolite allopregnanolone, emphasizing three key areas: biological properties, main functions, and effects on mood in women. Recent years of intensive research on progesterone and allopregnanolone have paved the way for new treatment of postpartum depression. However, treatment for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder as well as contraception that women can use without risking mental health problems are still needed. As far as progesterone is concerned, we might be dealing with a two-edged sword: while its metabolite allopregnanolone has been proven useful for treatment of PPD, it may trigger negative symptoms in women with PMS and PMDD. Overall, our current knowledge on the beneficial and harmful effects of progesterone is limited and further research is imperative.",

      "abstract": "Vitex agnus castus (VAC), also known as chaste tree, is a plant from the Mediterranean area, Crimea, and central Asia. Its fruit has been used for more than 2500 years as phytotherapic agent. In the last century, VAC has been mostly used for the treatment of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), menstrual irregularities, fertility disorders, and symptoms of menopause. Since some degree of hyperprolactinaemia may be observed in patients with such disorders, VAC effects on hyperprolactinaemia have been assessed in a small number of studies and in some patient series or single case reports. It has been postulated that the diterpenes contained in VAC extract may interact with dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) and inhibit prolactin release via dopamine D2R activation in the anterior pituitary. Most of the published papers focus on the use of VAC for the management of PMS or infertility. However, due to its action on D2R, VAC could have a role in the treatment of mild hyperprolactinaemia, including patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia, microprolactinoma, drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia, or polycystic ovary syndrome.",

We conducted literature searches of PubMed and Ichushi-Web and used the Jonna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality. Of the 77 studies included in the meta-analysis, significant odds ratios (ORs) were obtained for eight factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea (PD): age ≥ 20 years (OR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04−1.34), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01−2.26), longer menstrual periods (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04−0.28), irregular menstrual cycle (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13−1.45), family history of PD (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 2.18−6.61), stress (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.30−2.72), sleeping hours < 7 h (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04−1.35), and bedtime after 23:01 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16−1.45). Two factors were associated with severity of PD (moderate vs. severe): BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01−3.54) and smoking (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.08−3.47). PD severity (mild vs. severe) and prevalence of premenstrual syndrome were associated with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.04−3.50) and smoking (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31−2.66), respectively.

For definitive diagnosis prospectively self-reported symptoms should demonstrate a cyclic pattern and other psychological pathologies and thyroid dysfunction, that may present with similar symptoms, should be excluded. Both entities affect millions of women at reproductive age as the prevalence of PMS is given as 10-98% while PMDD affects 2-8%. Sex steroids and neurotransmitters have a central role in the etiology. The role of vitamins and minerals in the etiology and treatment of PMS and PMDD is open to discussion. Drugs that suppress ovarian sex steroid production, such as combined oral contraceptives or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors enhancing central serotonin delivery are used for treatment. Life-style changes and regular exercise also have a positive effect in milder cases. Tricyclic antidepressants and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues can be used in selected cases.",

      "abstract": "The most recent studies of progesterone research provide remarkable insights into the physiological role and clinical importance of this hormone. Although the name progesterone itself means \"promoting gestation\", this steroid hormone is far more than a gestational agent. Progesterone is recognized as a key physiological component of not only the menstrual cycle and pregnancy but also as an essential steroidogenic precursor of other gonadal and non-gonadal hormones such as aldosterone, cortisol, estradiol, and testosterone. Based on current findings, progesterone and novel progesterone-based drugs have many important functions, including contraception, treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, immune response, and prevention of cancer. Considering the above, reproduction and life are not possible without progesterone; thus, a better understanding of this essential molecule could enable safe and effective use of this hormone in many clinical conditions.",

Comorbid psychiatric disorders, medication use, and chronobiological sleep characteristics were also assessed. The prevalence of PMDD and PPD were high in ADHD, compared to the general population. PMDD symptoms were associated with less use of contraceptives. Antidepressants were associated with more PMDD symptoms. The following GCS scores were significant increased: anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction, vasomotor and somatic complaints. No significant differences were found in sleep characteristics or current comorbidity between the groups with and without PPD or PMDD, or increased climacteric scores. The prevalences of PMDD, PPD and climacteric scores were high in women with ADHD. This is the first study in women with ADHD that suggests that female ADHD patients suffer from significant PMDD symptoms, experience PPD during the first child birth, and experience more severe climacteric symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and primary dysmenorrhea are common complaints among young women. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin supplements on symptoms of pain in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken. Women who suffered from both PMS and dysmenorrhea were enrolled, and were randomly allocated to the curcumin (n = 62), or placebo (n = 62) groups. Each subject received one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid, or placebo) daily, from 7 days pre- until 3 days post-menstruation for three successive menstrual cycles. Participants recorded the severity of PMS, or dysmenorrhea using a Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool (PSST) and the visual analog scale, respectively. Baseline characteristics of participants did not differ between the curcumin and placebo groups. At the end of the trial, the PSST scores were significantly lower in both the curcumin (32.5 ± 9.8 vs. 21.6 ± 9.8); and placebo groups (31.7 ± 9.4 vs. 23.4 ± 12.8). There was a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in both the curcumin and placebo groups (by 64% and 53.3%, respectively). Hence, curcumin had comparable effects as placebo, regarding the amelioration of symptoms of PMS and dysmenorrhea. Further studies are required with larger samples, using higher doses curcumin for longer durations, and perhaps in combination therapy.",

      "title": "Hormonal Contraception and Depression: Updated Evidence and Implications in Clinical Practice.",
      "abstract": "Hormonal contraceptives are used worldwide by more than 100 million women. Some studies have been published about the possible appearance of depressive symptoms when using hormonal contraceptives, but this link is still a matter of debate. The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the literature on this issue, and to investigate the possible explanations of this problem based on animal and human studies. The main pathway responsible for menstrual cycle-related mood changes is the γ-aminobutyric acid pathway, which is sensitive to changes in the levels of progesterone and of its metabolites, the neurosteroids. In particular, allopregnanolone is a potentiating neurosteroid with anxiolytic and anti-convulsant effects whose levels change during a normal menstrual cycle together with progesterone levels. Progestins have different effects on allopregnanolone, mainly owing to their diverse androgenicity. Moreover, they might affect brain structure and function, even though the meaning of these changes has yet to be clarified. It is important to define the groups of women in which negative mood disorders are more likely to occur. Adolescence is a critical period and this age-specific vulnerability is complex and likely bidirectional. Moreover, women with a history of mood affective disorders or premenstrual dysphoric syndrome are at a higher risk when taking contraceptives. In this review, we aim to provide clinicians with advice on how to approach these difficult situations.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and primary dysmenorrhea are common gynecological problems and inflammation may have a role in their etiology. Curcumin is a polyphenolic natural product for which there is increasing evidence of anti-inflammatory and iron chelation effects. This study assessed the effects of curcumin on inflammatory biomarkers and iron profile in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. A sample of 76 patients was included in this triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants were randomly allocated to curcumin (n = 38) and control groups (n = 38). Each participant received one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid+ piperine, or placebo) daily, from 7 days before until 3 days after menstruation for three consecutive menstrual cycles. Serum iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), as well as white blood cell, lymphocyte, neutrophil, platelet counts, mean platelet volume (MPV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW), were quantified. Neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet: lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and RDW: platelet ratio (RPR) were also calculated. Curcumin significantly decreased the median (interquartile range) serum levels of hsCRP [from 0.30 mg/L (0.0-1.10) to 0.20 mg/L (0.0-1.3); p = 0.041] compared with placebo, but did not show any difference for neutrophil, RDW, MPV, NLR, PLR and RPR values (p > 0.05). The treatment schedule was well-tolerated, and none of markers of iron metabolism statistically changed after the intervention in the curcumin group (p > 0.05). Curcumin supplementation may have positive effects on serum hsCRP, a marker of inflammation, with no any changes on iron homeostasis in healthy women with PMS and dysmenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual symptoms are experienced by many female individuals during their fertile age. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a sex-specific mood disorder, affects about 5% of female individuals during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors represents a valid solution to manage PMDD for many, but not all, patients. Owing to maladaptive neural reactivity to gonadal hormone fluctuations, that is, the putative mechanism postulated to underlie PMDD, drugs suppressing or stabilizing such variations have been tested. Recently, a clinically significant reduction in the severity of the mental symptoms of PMDD was observed upon treatment with a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), as demonstrated when comparing ulipristal acetate with placebo in a randomised controlled trial. Stable and low progesterone levels, with maintained low-medium oestradiol levels, define the endocrine profile of this treatment. Importantly, the efficacy of SPRM treatment was accompanied by negligible side effects. These promising results represent a headway to understanding the mechanisms behind PMDD symptomatology and opening up new solutions in the management of PMDD. They also call for studies on the long-term efficacy, safety, and viability of SPRMs in female individuals during their fertile age to further support the development of targeted management of female's mental ill-health in relation to the menstrual cycle. The present overview thus seeks to inform about current and new pharmacological approaches to the management of premenstrual dysphoric disorder.",

In this scoping review (N = 85 studies), we survey existing human research studies in PMD, MM, and CE to outline the exogenous experimental hormone manipulation trials conducted in these fields. We examine a broad range of literature across these disorders in order to summarize existing diagnostic practices and research methods, highlight gaps in the experimental human literature, and elucidate future research opportunities within each field. While no individual treatment or study design can fit every disease, there is immense overlap in study design and established neuroendocrine-based hormone sensitivity among the menstrual cycle-related disorders PMD, MM, and CE.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome is primarily diagnosed clinically, with consistent characteristic symptoms occurring in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and resolving during menstruation or within the week following it. For a premenstrual dysphoric disorder diagnosis, a patient's symptoms must substantially interfere with work, school, social activities, or relationships or cause significant distress. Patients should record symptoms for at least two cycles because symptoms can vary from cycle to cycle. A symptom-tracking diary or diagnostic instrument, such as the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (a validated prospective survey tool), can be used to identify the cyclic pattern of symptoms. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are first-line treatment for premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, with rapid onset of improvement; however, adverse effects can limit their use. Cognitive behavior therapy, exercise, acupuncture or acupressure, and the herb Vitex agnus castus may be used to ameliorate premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms. Reassessment for another underlying cause of premenstrual dysphoric disorder symptoms should occur if symptoms are not controlled with medications or other interventions or persist throughout the month.",

This study included full-text research articles from conducted in Turkey, published in Turkish or English between 2014 and 2018 and indicating prevalence. This study included a total of 18 studies conducted in Turkey reporting the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome. A total of 6890 women participated in these studies. The overall premenstrual syndrome prevalence in the studies examined in this systematic review was 52.2%. Subgroup prevalence was found to be 59% in high school students, 50.3% in university students and 66% of women in general population. In the meta-regression analysis showed that there was no significant relationship between the mean age of the participants with the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome. The results of the study showed that premenstrual syndrome was prevalent among Turkish reproductive age women. Health professionals should organize training for women to gain the ability to manage PMS symptoms. Further interventional studies are needed to cope with PMS.",

Approximately 5-8 percent of women suffer with premenstrual syndrome, with the majority of those suffering from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Because of the complexity and multifaceted nature of the aetiology, it is yet unknown. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is diagnosed entirely on the basis of signs and symptoms, with no particular diagnostic tests available to confirm the diagnosis. Only a small number of therapeutic modalities are backed by clinical data, yet there are many accessible. After providing a brief overview of the disease, the author goes on to discuss the various hypotheses as to why PMS occurs. With an emphasis on tailored treatment based on symptom profile, it examines the wide range of non-pharmacological and pharmaceutical methods that are accessible today.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common problems for women of reproductive age worldwide, along with painful menstruation and genital inflammation. The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.",

      "abstract": "Many women suffer from premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which can be considered a modern illness in this busy society; mental symptoms, such as irritability, often affect the surroundings and result in loss of self-confidence. The symptoms of PMS are diverse, and it is often difficult to treat psychiatric and social symptoms with low-dose estrogen progestin combination drug (LEP) alone. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are also effective; however, many are unable to take them owing to their side effects. \"Kambakutaisoto\" is a Kampo medicine consisting of \"jujube,\" \"licorice,\" and \"wheat,\" which is often described as \"food\"; however, it is highly effective in treating emotional instability attributed to PMS in sensitive young women. There are many reports on the effects of kambakutaisoto; the molecular nutritional findings of kambakutaisoto, which has dramatic effects despite its mild composition of crude drugs, have also been reported, suggesting an association with premenstrual exacerbation of functional hypoglycemia. A narrative review of its clinical effects on PMS and the results of molecular nutrition studies was performed.",

The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle in daily life and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. The onset and severity of PMS are determined by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and the combined presence of other physiological (e.g., chronobiological and circadian) and psychological stressors, which interact with each other. The diagnosis of PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is based on the following criteria, as recommended by the International Society for Premenstrual Disorders (ISPMD): in PMS, the woman has 1-4 symptoms, which may be physical, behavioural or affective/psychological, or at least five symptoms, which may be physical or behavioural. However, if a woman has 5 or more symptoms, and one of these is affective (e.g., irritability, mood swings, anger) in addition to physical or behavioural symptoms, a more accurate diagnosis of PMDD can be made. Since, in addition to the general and gynecological history, the prospective scales (e.g., Prospective record of the impact and severity of menstrual symptoms - PRISM; Daily record of severity of problems - DRSP) completed daily by the physician are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of PMS and PMDD, it is important to take into account the severity of symptoms, the woman's plans for conception or contraceptive needs, her other associated medical conditions, her response to previous treatment methods, and her history of other medical conditions when formulating a treatment plan. Therapeutic options include regular aerobic exercise, stress relief, cognitive behavioural therapy, drug treatments (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors - SSRIs, combined oral estrogen-progestin contraceptives - COCs, GnRH agonists), -depending on the severity of PMS and PMDD.",

      "title": "Melatonin for premenstrual syndrome: A potential remedy but not ready.",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS), a recurrent and moderate disorder that occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and quickly resolves after menstruation, is characterized by somatic and emotional discomfort that can be severe enough to impair daily activities. Current therapeutic drugs for PMS such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not very satisfying. As a critical pineal hormone, melatonin has increasingly been suggested to modulate PMS symptoms. In this review, we update the latest progress on PMS-induced sleep disturbance, mood changes, and cognitive impairment and provide possible pathways by which melatonin attenuates these symptoms. Moreover, we focus on the role of melatonin in PMS molecular mechanisms. Herein, we show that melatonin can regulate ovarian estrogen and progesterone, of which cyclic fluctuations contribute to PMS pathogenesis. Melatonin also modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor system in PMS. Interpreting the role of melatonin in PMS is not only informative to clarify PMS etiology but also instructive to melatonin and its receptor agonist application to promote female health. As a safe interaction, melatonin treatment can be effective in alleviating symptoms of PMS. However, symptoms such as sleep disturbance, depressive mood, cognitive impairment are not specific and can be easily misdiagnosed. Connections between melatonin receptor, ovarian steroid dysfunction, and PMS are not consistent among past studies. Before final conclusions are drawn, more well-organized and rigorous studies are recommended.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to examine premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in university students and their coping behaviors. 452 female students were included in this descriptive and correlational study. The data were collected using a descriptive information form, the Premenstrual Syndrome Scale (PMSS), and the Premenstrual Change Coping Inventory (PMS-Cope). PMS symptoms were found in 80.5% of students. Seeking positive affect-inducing activities to cope with PMS was found to be a significant predictor of reducing the severity of PMS (β =-0.265, p < .001). In coping with PMS, it is necessary to consider the perceptions of taking medication, seeking social support, or seeking positive affect-inducing activities as a coping method to determine the social and cultural beliefs of university students and control PMS. PMS is a significant health problem and raising awareness of the issue alone may not be enough. It should also be noted that the severity of PMS can vary markedly between ethnic groups, and women's strategies for coping with symptoms and their effectiveness may differ between cultures. It is pivotal to develop strategies for university students to cope with PMS and provide personalized care.",

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as pain during the menstrual cycle in the absence of an identifiable cause. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Dysmenorrhea can negatively affect a woman's quality of life and interfere with daily activities. The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is likely a result of the cyclooxygenase pathway producing increased prostanoids, particularly prostaglandins (PGs). The increased PGs cause uterine contractions that restrict blood flow and lead to the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain receptors. Women with a history typical for primary dysmenorrhea can initiate empiric treatment without additional testing. Shared decision making is key to effective management of dysmenorrhea to maximize patient compliance and satisfaction. After a discussion of their risks and benefits, extremely effective empiric therapies are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and contraceptive hormonal therapy. Other treatments for primary dysmenorrhea can be employed solely or in combination with other modalities, but the literature supporting their use is not as convincing. The physician should initiate an evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea if the patient does not report improved symptomatology after being compliant with their medical regimen.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea is common and usually independent of, rather than secondary to, pelvic pathology. Dysmenorrhea occurs in 50% to 90% of adolescent girls and women of reproductive age and is a leading cause of absenteeism. Secondary dysmenorrhea as a result of endometriosis, pelvic anatomic abnormalities, or infection may present with progressive worsening of pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, vaginal discharge, or dyspareunia. Initial workup should include a menstrual history and pregnancy test for patients who are sexually active. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives are first-line medical options that may be used independently or in combination. Because most progestin or estrogen-progestin combinations are effective, secondary indications, such as contraception, should be considered. Good evidence supports the effectiveness of some nonpharmacologic options, including exercise, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, heat therapy, and self-acupressure. If secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or hormonal therapies may be effective, but further workup should include pelvic examination and ultrasonography. Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist may be warranted for further evaluation and treatment.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to identify factors associated with the prevalence and severity of menstrual-related symptoms. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021208432). We conducted literature searches of PubMed and Ichushi-Web and used the Jonna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist to assess the quality. Of the 77 studies included in the meta-analysis, significant odds ratios (ORs) were obtained for eight factors associated with primary dysmenorrhea (PD): age ≥ 20 years (OR: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04−1.34), body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.01−2.26), longer menstrual periods (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.04−0.28), irregular menstrual cycle (OR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13−1.45), family history of PD (OR: 3.80; 95% CI: 2.18−6.61), stress (OR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.30−2.72), sleeping hours < 7 h (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.04−1.35), and bedtime after 23:01 (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.16−1.45). Two factors were associated with severity of PD (moderate vs. severe): BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.01−3.54) and smoking (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 1.08−3.47). PD severity (mild vs. severe) and prevalence of premenstrual syndrome were associated with BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.04−3.50) and smoking (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.31−2.66), respectively. The identified risk factors could be utilized to construct an appropriate strategy to improve menstrual symptoms and support women’s health.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic condition, with debilitating symptoms affecting all ages. Dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain often begin in adolescence, affecting school, daily activities, and relationships. Despite the profound burden of endometriosis, many adolescents experience suboptimal management and significant delay in diagnosis. The symptomatology and laparoscopic findings of endometriosis in adolescents are often different than in adults, and the medical and surgical treatments for adolescents may differ from those for adults as well. This Narrative Review summarizes the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of endometriosis in adolescents. Given the unique challenges and complexities associated with diagnosing endometriosis in this age group, it is crucial to maintain a heightened level of suspicion and to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms. By maintaining this lower threshold for consideration, we can ensure timely and accurate diagnosis, enabling early intervention and improved management in our adolescent patients.",

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) refers to painful cramps before and/or during menstruation. There is a need for emphasis on alternative methods of conservative treatment, so as to reduce the dependence on drugs for alleviating the symptoms. The aim was to find out the effectiveness of some physiotherapy techniques in the treatment of PD. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to PRISMA standards. The descriptors were \"dysmenorrhea\", \"physical the-rapy\", \"physiotherapy\", and \"manual therapy\". The search was performed in five databases: Scopus, PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, and Medline, in February 2021. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials over the last six years. Articles not related to the treatment of PD or using pharmacology as the main treatment were excluded. Nine articles met the objectives and criteria, with a total of 692 participants. The most used scale to measure pain was the VAS (visual analogue scale). The main techniques were isometric exercises, massage therapy, yoga, electrotherapy, connective tissue manipulation, stretching, kinesio tape, progressive relaxation exercises and aerobic dance. Meta-analysis shows benefits of physiotherapy treatment for pain relief compared with no intervention or placebo (MD: -1.13, 95% CI: -1.61 to -0.64, I",

      "abstract": "Studies show that between 41% and 91.5% of young women, school-aged and university-aged, are affected by dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins, is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen and/or pelvis occurring just before or during menstruation, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis, and typically lasting 1-3 days and with a negative physical examination. Secondary dysmenorrhea presents with similar signs and symptoms but is a result of underlying pelvic pathology, for example endometriosis or uterine fibroids. Dysmenorrhea most typically presents as abdominal cramping; however, it can also present with headaches, nausea, vomiting or other generalized symptoms. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, but other tests such as a pelvic examination, a pregnancy test and STI screening may be helpful in ruling out other sources of pain. Although the mainstay of treatment for dysmenorrhea is NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, lifestyle changes and complementary/alternative medicine can also be helpful approaches. Lifestyle changes include aerobic exercise and stretching, while complementary alternative medicine include peppermint, cinnamon, ginger and other herbs and supplements. Finally, endometriosis must be considered as a potential cause for secondary dysmenorrhea and would warrant a prompt referral to gynecology.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and primary dysmenorrhea are common complaints among young women. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin supplements on symptoms of pain in young women with PMS and dysmenorrhea. A randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was undertaken. Women who suffered from both PMS and dysmenorrhea were enrolled, and were randomly allocated to the curcumin (n = 62), or placebo (n = 62) groups. Each subject received one capsule (500 mg of curcuminoid, or placebo) daily, from 7 days pre- until 3 days post-menstruation for three successive menstrual cycles. Participants recorded the severity of PMS, or dysmenorrhea using a Premenstrual Syndrome Screening Tool (PSST) and the visual analog scale, respectively. Baseline characteristics of participants did not differ between the curcumin and placebo groups. At the end of the trial, the PSST scores were significantly lower in both the curcumin (32.5 ± 9.8 vs. 21.6 ± 9.8); and placebo groups (31.7 ± 9.4 vs. 23.4 ± 12.8). There was a significant reduction of dysmenorrhea pain in both the curcumin and placebo groups (by 64% and 53.3%, respectively). Hence, curcumin had comparable effects as placebo, regarding the amelioration of symptoms of PMS and dysmenorrhea. Further studies are required with larger samples, using higher doses curcumin for longer durations, and perhaps in combination therapy.",

Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are available for pain relief, but information on their effectiveness, particularly regarding green coconut water, dark chocolate, and Ibuprofen, remains limited. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of green coconut water, dark chocolate bars, and Ibuprofen in reducing the intensity of primary dysmenorrhea. In this research, a randomized controlled trial with a quantitative design was conducted, involving 45 participants randomly assigned to receive 330 mL of green coconut water, 35 g of 70% dark chocolate, or 400 mg Ibuprofen. The interventions were administered on the first day of menstruation when dysmenorrhea symptoms typically occur in subjects. This study used a single-dose approach to evaluate the immediate impact of each treatment. The subjects were instructed to consume the given interventional product within 15 min. The pain intensity was measured using a Numeric Rating Scale before the intervention and 2 h after the subjects finished consuming the interventional product. The multivariate Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in effectiveness among the three interventions (",

Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent gynecologic dysfunction that affects the social and professional lives of women. It can occur at every menstrual cycle, depending on the cause and psychologic factors. Studies have reported poor sleep and insomnia symptoms in dysmenorrhea condition, which may intensify the dysmenorrhea manifestation and interfere negatively to its treatment. There is an urgent need to identify the main cause of this dysfunction and provide efficient treatments to minimize the detrimental effects of dysmenorrhea in quality of life of these women.",

      "title": "The Sprint-Interval Exercise Using a Spinning Bike Improves Physical Fitness and Ameliorates Primary Dysmenorrhea Symptoms Through Hormone and Inflammation Modulations: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea with high prevalence has been categorized as primary dysmenorrhea (PD) and secondary dysmenorrhea due to differences in pathogenesis. A significant number of reproductive females suffering from monthly menstruation have to deal with negative impacts on their quality of life, work/study productivity, activities, and social relationships. In addition to medical treatment, exercise has been recognized as a complementary and alternative strategy for disease prevention, alleviation, and rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of exercise on the severity of primary dysmenorrhea, physiological modulation, and physical fitness. Participants consisted of university students who were enrolled in the study and divided into a non-PD (Control) and a PD group based on recruiting criteria, the latter being randomly assigned to either an untreated dysmenorrhea group or a dysmenorrhea group that underwent 10 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise (Dysmen and DysmenHIIT, respectively). The DysmenHIIT group used spinning bikes and the training intensity was validated by heart rate monitors and BORG rating of perceived exertion. Forms containing participant information (premenstrual symptoms, menstrual distress, and a Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire) as well as physical fitness, biochemical variables, hormone and prostaglandin (PGE2 and PGF2α) levels were assessed before and after the exercise intervention. After intervention, premenstrual symptoms (anger, anxiety, depression, activity level, fatigue, etc.), menstrual distress symptoms (cramps, aches, swelling, etc.), and pain severity were shown to be significantly mitigated, possibly through hormone (estradiol, prolactin, progesterone, and cortisol) modulation. Furthermore, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), PGE2 and PGF2α levels were also down-regulated, resulting in the amelioration of uterine contraction and inflammation. Participants' physical fitness, including cardiovascular endurance and explosive force, was significantly improved after HIIT. The 10-week HIIT spinning bike exercise used in this study could be employed as a potential and complementary treatment for PD symptoms alleviation and considered as part of an educational health plan for promoting women's health. However, the effects of HIIT utilizing different exercise methods and accounting for different age populations and secondary PD warrant further investigation.",

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) gives good clinical results for the treatment of dysmenorrhea based on the basic principles of holistic view and syndrome differentiation. However, presently, the clinical practice guidelines in TCM for dysmenorrhea treatment are required. The guideline is formulated in strict accordance with the principles of evidence-based medicine with reference to the General Principles for the Compilation of International Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndromes and General Principles for the Compilation of International Clinical Practice Guidelines for Traditional Chinese Medicine Diseases and accordance with the principles and methods of The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation in China (AGREE-China) and World Health Organization guidelines. This guideline includes clinical issues by literature search and questionnaire survey, and eight background questions and 23 prospect questions were finally created. Based on the evidence retrieval, synthesis, consideration of patient preferences and values, intervention costs, advantages, and disadvantages, recommendations are created using the Delphi method and expert consensus method. This guideline clarified the definition, diagnosis, and TCM syndrome classification for dysmenorrhea, and recommends different TCM treatments based on the level of evidence, including Chinese herbal medicine, Chinese patent medicine, acupuncture, and other auxiliary therapies. The present guideline is an international clinical practice guideline for the treatment of dysmenorrhea using TCM. This guideline will provide substantive evidence and standardized guidance for the treatment of dysmenorrhea using TCM, improve the quality and safety of medical services, and standardize diagnosis and treatment plans for dysmenorrhea.",

The presence of dyschezia, particularly with cyclical exacerbation, should raise suspicion for bowel or rectovaginal septum involvement, and a greater need for surgical management. Treatment of dysmenorrhea includes hormonal suppression of the menstrual cycle, and/or analgesics; more severe cases with strong pain and disability may require earlier surgical intervention to excise disease while preserving fertility desires.",

We used data from the New England Case-Control Study, including 1,187 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 1,225 population-based controls enrolled between 1998 and 2008 with detailed information on analgesic use for their menstrual pain. We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between analgesic use (i.e., aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) for menstrual pain and ovarian cancer risk. We further conducted a stratified analysis by intensity of menstrual pain (mild/moderate, severe). Among women with menstrual pain during their 20s and 30s, ever use of analgesics for menstrual pain was not significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk. However, among women with severe menstrual pain, ever use of aspirin or acetaminophen for menstrual pain was inversely associated with risk (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18-0.94 and OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.21-0.88 compared with never users, respectively). No significant association was observed between analgesic use and ovarian cancer risk among women with mild/moderate menstrual pain (",

Myofascial pelvic pain is involved in an estimated 22% to 94% of cases of chronic pelvic pain, which is one of the most common gynecologic conditions in the United States. Myofascial pelvic pain may exist independently or in conjunction with disorders such as vaginismus, dysmenorrhea, and endometriosis and is frequently a causative factor in sexual pain or dyspareunia. This article reviews the pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment options for myofascial pelvic pain, with a particular focus on trigger point injections.

This randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at the Research Center for Womens' Health at Södersjukhuset, a university hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Forty women from 18 to 50 years of age with endometriosis and severe dysmenorrhea with or without chronic pelvic pain were given 20 mg Melatonin or placebo orally daily for two consecutive menstrual cycles or months. The level of pain was recorded daily on the 11-point numeric rating scale, a difference of 1.3 units was considered clinically significant. Clincaltrials.gov nr NCT03782740. Sixteen participants completed the study in the placebo group and 18 in the melatonin group. The difference in endometriosis-associated pain between the groups showed to be non-significant statistically as well as clinically, 2.9 (SD 1.9) in the melatonin group and 3.3 (SD 2.0) in the placebo group, p = 0.45.

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea is pelvic pain associated with menstruation and is one of the most common pain conditions among reproductive-age women. It is commonly treated with medications, complementary and alternative medicine, and self-management techniques. However, there is increased focus on psychological interventions which modify thoughts, beliefs, emotions, and behavioral responses to dysmenorrhea. This review examined the efficacy of psychological interventions on dysmenorrhea pain severity and interference. We conducted a systematic search of the literature using PsycINFO, PubMed, CINHAL, and Embase. A total of 22 studies were included; 21 examined within-group improvement (ie, within-group analysis) and 14 examined between-group improvement (ie, between-group analysis). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted on pain severity and interference, with average effect sizes calculated using Hedges's g. Within-group analyses showed decreased pain severity and interference at post-treatment (g = 0.986 and 0.949, respectively) and first follow-up (g = 1.239 and 0.842, respectively). Between-group analyses showed decreased pain severity at post-treatment (g = 0.909) and decreased pain severity and interference at first follow-up (g = 0.964 and 0.884, respectively) compared to control groups. This review supports the efficacy of psychological interventions for dysmenorrhea, but conclusions are tempered by suboptimal methodological quality of the included studies and high heterogeneity across studies. Additional, rigorous research is needed to determine the clinical utility of psychological interventions for dysmenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Current medical treatments for endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) have limitations, including symptom recurrence and hormonal side effects. For this reason, it is important to elucidate any alternative or complementary treatments available, while Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) shows potential to be this treatment. This study aims to provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of CHM for EAP. Randomized control trials comparing CHM to other treatments for EAP in women with endometriosis were considered eligible, and they were searched for in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov, as well as in the Chinese databases Sino-Med and CNKI, from inception to October 2021. Numerous outcomes were put through meta-analysis using a weighted mean difference and a 95% CI, and the results of dichotomous data were presented as a pooled RR with a 95% CI. A total of 34 eligible studies with 3389 participants were included. Compared with no treatment, there was a statistically significant pooled benefit of CHM on dysmenorrhea at the end of 3-month treatment, and these effects continued for 3 months, but not 9 months, after treatment. Compared with conventional therapy, a significant difference was found in the levels of pelvic pain with a lower rate of hot flush and irregular vaginal bleeding at the end of treatment for 3 months, but not after treatment. Comparing combined treatment with CHM and conventional therapy with conventional therapy alone, significant decreases were found in dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic pain after a 3-month treatment cycle, and in dysmenorrhea after a 4-month treatment cycle with a lower hot flash rate. In conclusion, CHM, used alone or in combination with conventional therapies, appears to have benefits in relieving EAP with fewer side effects than traditional treatment.",

      "abstract": "Adenomyosis (AM) is a common gynecological disorder characterized by the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium. It is associated with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate AM, the exact cause and development of the condition remain unclear. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of macrophage polarization in the microenvironment, which plays a crucial role in AM initiation and progression. However, a comprehensive review regarding the role and regulatory mechanism of macrophage polarization in AM is currently lacking. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the phenotype and function of macrophage polarization and the phenomenon of the polarization of adenomyosis-associated macrophages (AAMs). It also elaborates on the role and regulatory mechanism of AAM polarization in invasion/migration, fibrosis, angiogenesis, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Furthermore, this review explores the underlying molecular mechanisms of AAM polarization and suggests future research directions. In conclusion, this review provides a new perspective on understanding the pathogenesis of AM and provides a theoretical foundation for developing targeted drugs through the regulation of AAM polarization.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this review is to clarify the relative association between adenomyosis and infertility and the possible treatment for an infertile patient. Although adenomyosis is detected more often in women of late reproductive age, its influence on pregnancy rates is important, especially considering the tendency to delay pregnancy among women in developed countries. In this article, we present a critical analysis of the literature data concerning the impact of adenomyosis on fertility. The possible effects of treatment on the pregnancy rate will also be discussed. We conducted a literature search; publications from Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane databases published from 1982 to 2019 were retrieved using terms 'adenomyosis and infertility' and 'adenomyosis and pregnancy outcomes', extensively studied in the aspects of diagnosis, pathogenesis of infertility and possible treatment methods. Molecular studies have given deep insight into the pathogenesis of adenomyosis in the recent few years, but there is a huge discrepancy between in vitro studies and praxis. Oral contraceptive pills, anti-prostaglandins, oral or parenteral progestins, danazol and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues have all been used to control menstrual pain and menorrhagia in women with adenomyosis, but they temporarily suppress the menstrual cycle. Additionally, endometrial ablation and hysterectomy used to alleviate pain caused by adenomyosis exclude pregnancy planning. The development of imaging techniques-ultrasound and MRI-enables the diagnosis of adenomyosis with very high accuracy nowadays, but the methods of treatment mentioned above have not given satisfactory results in women planning pregnancy. For these patients, the high-intensity-focused ultrasound method (HIFU) and combined treatment before assisted reproductive techniques can prove beneficial in adenomyosis patients.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in heightened stress for many individuals, with women reporting more stress than men. Although a large body of evidence has demonstrated that stress, in general, can impact the menstrual cycle, it is not yet clear if COVID-specific stress would impact women's menstrual health. The current study explored the relationship between COVID-related stress and distress and menstrual variables (menstrual pain, number and severity of menstrual symptoms, and menstrual pain interference) in a sample of reproductive-age adult women. Seven-hundred fifteen women completed the initial survey and were re-contacted to complete the same survey three months later. Of those recontacted, 223 completed the follow-up survey. Results indicated that COVID-related stress and distress was associated with higher levels of menstrual pain, more frequent and more severe menstrual symptoms, and greater menstrual pain interference, even after accounting for age, hormonal use, bodily pain, and pain catastrophizing. Our findings suggest that women experience unique vulnerabilities that directly impact their health and functioning, and both research and clinical care should address these symptoms through careful assessment and treatment of menstrual pain and symptoms, particularly during and after periods of high stress and distress.",

      "abstract": "Prenatal care and infant mortality rates are crucial indicators of healthcare quality. However, millions of women in low-income countries lack access to adequate care. Factors such as high-risk pregnancies and unmanaged diet increase the risk of developing complications during pregnancy, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring of maternal health. The increasing burden of non-communicable diseases represents a significant threat to fragile health systems. The lack of access to appropriate prenatal care and poor maternal and newborn health outcomes are major concerns in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It emphasizes the need for innovative, integrative approaches to healthcare delivery, especially in pregnant women. The health services need to be reorganized holistically and effectively, focusing on factors that directly impact maternal, neonatal, and infant mortality, resulting in improved access to maternity services and survival of \"at-risk\" mothers and their offspring in many LMICs. Based on the FIGO (the International Federation of Gynecology & Obstetrics) recommendations of extending preconception care to the postpartum stage, the authors of this review have developed a new model of care-PregCare-based on the triple-intervention-based holistic and multidisciplinary maternal and fetal medicine model for low-risk pregnancies. This model will help transform the traditional model's high visitation frequency into a safe and reduced office visit, while increasing virtual connections, point of care and self-care with doctors, nurses, and community-based providers of self-care. This shall be based on a sophisticated central PregCare call center powered by innovative technologies combined with experienced personnel in perinatal management (doctors and nurses/midwives).",

      "abstract": "Concurrent with the rise of digital health and personal health tracking technologies, a market has also emerged of products targeted specifically at women: 'femtech'. This article is motivated by the concern that insufficient regulatory attention has been devoted to this growing market, and that extant ambiguity in the regulation of femtech leaves its users at risk of relying on technologies of as-yet unproven worth. It is posited that femtech profoundly disrupts well-established regulatory mechanisms of protection in ways that mean that these silos of protection will not be adequate. This is because regulation, as it is currently constructed, is insufficiently sensitive to feminist perspectives regarding what these technologies mean for women. As a result, the regulatory sphere in which femtech operates fundamentally fails to ensure that the health and safety of femtech users are protected as this market continues to expand. To counteract this, the argument is made that an appropriate regulatory response to femtech must respond to the distinctive unmet need in the regulation of this technological realm and the acute risk that femtech poses. This must include a multidimensional whole-system approach grounded in feminist perspectives on health, fertility, and technology.",

      "abstract": "Medical technologies are pervasive across women's health, spanning across obstetric and gynecological care. FemTech, the sector responsible for developing these technologies, is growing at 15.6% per annum. However, there are concerns of disconnects between new product development (NPD) and the care afforded to women in consequence of implementing these innovations. The most crucial stage of NPD involves understanding the clinical need. Without a clear need and clinical use case, innovators risk developing solutions which do not address the issues women and caregivers experience. Thus, the product will miss the market and experience limited uptake. Tools for performing clinical needs assessments and defining the use case are being developed. This review provides an analysis of their strengths and weaknesses to inform FemTech innovators of the available resources. We further discuss concepts for creating a unified approach to assessing unmet needs such that technologies have a higher chance of improving women's healthcare.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of FemTech technologies promises to revolutionize women's health and reproductive rights but conceals an insidious trap of surveillance and control in the hands of private and state actors. This article examines the extent to which FemTech technologies, under the guise of empowerment, enable private actors to play a leading role in managing reproductive rights, replacing largely inactive States in this crucial function. The analysis shows how private FemTech companies are becoming critical players in implementing and defending these rights, often in response to the inaction or inadequacies of States. The article approaches the FemTech phenomenon from several angles, including the promises of empowerment, concerns about surveillance and control, and the ambivalent roles of private actors as implementers and defenders of reproductive rights. This structure makes it possible to offer a critical analysis of the legal, societal, and ethical implications of FemTech, highlighting the tensions between the promises of empowerment and the risks of surveillance and control.",

      "abstract": "The United States has abysmal reproductive health indices that, in part, reflect stark inequities experienced by people of color and those with preexisting medical conditions. The growth of \"femtech,\" or technology-based solutions to women's health issues, in the public and private sectors is promising, yet these solutions are often geared toward health-literate, socioeconomically privileged, and/or relatively healthy white cis-women. In this viewpoint, we propose a set of guiding principles for building technologies that proactively identify and address these critical gaps in health care for people from socially and economically marginalized populations that are capable of pregnancy, as well as people with serious chronic medical conditions. These guiding principles require that such technologies: (1) include community stakeholders in the design, development, and deployment of the technology; (2) are grounded in person-centered frameworks; and (3) address health disparities as a strategy to advance health equity and improve health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abysmal sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes in the United States persist due to multiple factors, including diminishing SRH care access and inequities in care for socially or economically marginalized populations. Digital innovations have the potential to address gaps in SRH care as scalable, low-cost, patient-centered solutions that supplement the formal healthcare system. Our multidisciplinary team has developed a suite of patient-facing digital tools to help address suboptimal SRH care delivery for marginalized individuals capable of pregnancy, including those with chronic medical conditions. These tools-MyPath for reproductive preferences, prepregnancy health, and contraception; MyVoice for SRH needs of people with rheumatic/autoimmune disease or cystic fibrosis; MyDecision for tubal sterilization; and MyHealthyPregnancy for tailored pregnancy support-are guided by principles of community engagement, person-centeredness, and health equity. In the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning federal abortion protections, as well as the rapidly shifting policy landscape under the current administration, there are new considerations for use and implementation of digital SRH tools. In this commentary, we draw directly from lessons learned in our work to discuss emerging concerns related to data privacy and pregnancy criminalization, trust in healthcare providers and systems, and research. We then propose recommendations for researchers seeking to create, implement, and evaluate these tools with the goal of safeguarding reproductive autonomy and achieving health equity in this new policy context.",

In this narrative review, 23 different, nonprescription wearables and devices designed to help women track their fertile window were identified as currently, commercially available in the United States. The majority of these utilize measurements of basal body temperature or combinations of various urinary hormones. This clinical opinion characterizes the scant available research validating the accuracy of these technologies. It further examines research oversight, discusses the utility of these wearables and devices to consumers, and considers these technologies through an equity lens. The discussion concludes with a call for innovation, describing promising new technologies that not only harness unique physiologic parameters to predict ovulation, but also focus on cost-effectiveness with the hope of increasing access to these currently costly devices and wearables.",

With research demonstrating that maternal vaginal microbes first \"seed\" infants' immuno-development and then dynamic relations at the breast develop it, microbes and their relations become reframed as a kind of intergenerational biocultural \"inheritance.\" This inheritance is experienced through microbiopolitical demands for a \"good vagina\" or the incitement to breastfeed-what we term a chimeric imperative-but is also framed as potentially severable, replicable, and redistributable. Returning to Strathern's theorizing about how the body's porosity facilitates such partible detachments and reattachments, we analyze four companies' projects that exploit microbes' dynamic potential to address persistent gendered health gaps. We argue that newly relational ideas about embodiment reconceptualize the biopolitical demands of and on the reproductive body, guide how venture-tech companies seek to address persistent technical and ethical challenges, and reconceptualize how people form biosocial connections across bodies. Taking microbes' partible nature seriously highlights these intergenerational transfers as ongoing and full of possibility for a range of people; enabling not only expected attachments, but also other shared embodiments potentially distributed beyond the skin.",

However, several factors-notably, high costs, considerable effort, and the sensitivity of these topics-impede the collection of the necessary data, especially in less accessible and lower-income populations. The burgeoning ownership of smartphones and growing use of menstrual tracking apps (MTAs) may present an opportunity to conduct reproductive health research with fewer impediments than those associated with conventional survey methods.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cancer causes 350,000 deaths annually, with 90% occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), despite being largely preventable through vaccination and screening. This review examines innovative approaches to address screening coverage gaps worldwide, analysing both established programmes in high-income countries and implementation strategies for LMICs. Self-sampling technologies demonstrate significant potential to improve the uptake of cervical screening, thereby improving cervical cancer prevention compared to traditional methods, particularly benefiting underserved populations across all healthcare settings. Among self-collection devices, vaginal brushes achieve sensitivity of 94.6% (95% CI: 92.4-96.8) for HPV detection, while novel approaches like the tampon show promising results (sensitivity 82.9-100%, specificity 91.6-96.8%) with high user acceptability. Implementation strategies vary by healthcare context, with high-income countries achieving success through integrated screening programmes and digital solutions, while LMICs demonstrate effective adaptation through community-based distribution (20-35% uptake) and innovative delivery methods. In resource-limited settings, self-sampling increases participation through enhanced patient comfort and cultural acceptability, while reducing costs by 32-48%. Progress toward WHO's cervical cancer elimination goals require careful consideration of local healthcare infrastructure, cultural contexts and sustainable financing mechanisms. Future research priorities include optimising self-sampling technologies for sustainability and scalability, developing context-specific implementation strategies and validating artificial intelligence applications to enhance screening efficiency across diverse healthcare settings.",

      "title": "Femtech in context: A critical conceptual (re)view.",
      "abstract": "Emerging as a commercial category in 2016, 'femtech' has been publicly celebrated as a category of consumer-based digital health technologies designed to support the unmet and systemically marginalized health needs of women in areas such as menstruation, fertility, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause, through data-driven apps, wearables, and self-diagnostic tools. Since its emergence, the term femtech has become culturally significant and has taken on a life of its own across commercial, public, and healthcare discourses. Despite the growth of femtech scholarship, clarity is lacking on how different disciplines have challenged the assumptions about sex, gender, health, technology, and innovation that shape dominant understandings of 'who' femtech is for (i.e. fem) and 'what' it constitutes (i.e. tech). Motivated by this research gap, a critical conceptual review was conducted to provide new entry points into critical debates. This article novelly adapts 'diffractive reading' as a methodological approach to bring disciplinary perspectives on femtech into conversation with one another across anthropology, computer science, cultural studies, gender studies, information studies, law, media studies, medicine, and science and technology studies. This article focuses on insights drawn between critiques of femtech which trouble the ideologies, discourses, and practices that shape dominant understandings of 'fem' and 'tech'. In thinking through and with the conceptual boundaries of femtech, this review underscores the ongoing need to examine femtech's role in shaping global dynamics of reproductive, labor, and environmental justice, in addition to neoliberal approaches to healthcare more broadly.",

      "abstract": "Nigeria has one of the highest child mortality rates globally, with 111 deaths per 1000 live births. Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) improves infant survival by providing essential nutrients and antibodies that protect against infections and diseases. Despite its benefits, EBF rates in Nigeria remain low at 29%, largely due to limited health care support and breastfeeding guidance. With the proliferation of mobile phones in Nigeria, mobile health (mHealth) interventions are being explored as scalable solutions. SMS text messaging interventions have demonstrated success in delivering behavioral interventions; yet, few use artificial intelligence (AI) for personalized breastfeeding support.",

      "abstract": "Period-tracking applications (PTA) and paired data-tracking devices have become popular tools for promoting reproductive health, offering features to monitor menstrual cycles and track fertility. However, these apps present significant concerns regarding the privacy of sensitive health data as the current legal landscape provides inadequate coverage to ensure user safety, leaving the collection, usage, management, and disclosure of data to be determined by company leaders. While the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has regulatory mechanisms to hold PTAs accountable for their business practices, security concerns remain. Fears around personal health data security have intensified after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade as experts warn digital reproductive health data derived from PTAs could be used as criminal evidence in states with abortion restrictions. In the absence of a federal standard protecting the right to abortion, a comprehensive approach to safeguarding digital reproductive health data is required to ensure PTAs can remain health literacy tools that promote reproductive health and autonomy. This commentary reviews the current regulatory environment in the U.S. regarding PTAs, highlighting the risks to user privacy and data security-as evidenced by the 2020 FTC complaint against Flo Health, Inc. for sharing sensitive user data with third parties-and the broader implications of regulatory gaps in a post-Roe landscape.",

Decades of grassroots campaigns have helped to raise awareness about the impact of cardiovascular disease in women, and positive changes affecting women and their health have gained momentum. Despite these efforts, there has been stagnation in the overall reduction of cardiovascular disease burden for women in the past decade. Cardiovascular disease in women remains understudied, under-recognised, underdiagnosed, and undertreated. This Commission summarises existing evidence and identifies knowledge gaps in research, prevention, treatment, and access to care for women. Recommendations from an international team of experts and leaders in the field have been generated with a clear focus to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease in women by 2030. This Commission represents the first effort of its kind to connect stakeholders, to ignite global awareness of sex-related and gender-related disparities in cardiovascular disease, and to provide a springboard for future research.",

      "title": "A global analysis of the determinants of maternal health and transitions in maternal mortality.",
      "abstract": "The reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal health and wellbeing are complex tasks. This Series paper analyses the distal and proximal determinants of maternal health, as well as the exposures, risk factors, and micro-correlates related to maternal mortality. This paper also examines the relationship between these determinants and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality (a phenomenon described as the maternal mortality transition). We conducted two systematic reviews of the literature and we analysed publicly available data on indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically, estimates prepared by international organisations, including the UN and the World Bank. We considered 23 frameworks depicting maternal health and wellbeing as a multifactorial process, with superdeterminants that broadly affect women's health and wellbeing before, during, and after pregnancy. We explore the role of social determinants of maternal health, individual characteristics, and health-system features in the production of maternal health and wellbeing. This paper argues that the preventable deaths of millions of women each decade are not solely due to biomedical complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period, but are also tangible manifestations of the prevailing determinants of maternal health and persistent inequities in global health and socioeconomic development. This paper underscores the need for broader, multipronged actions to improve maternal health and wellbeing and accelerate sustainable reductions in maternal mortality. For women who have pregnancy, childbirth, or postpartum complications, the health system provides a crucial opportunity to interrupt the chain of events that can potentially end in maternal death. Ultimately, expanding the health sector ecosystem to mitigate maternal health determinants and tailoring the configuration of health systems to counter the detrimental effects of eco-social forces, including though increased access to quality-assured commodities and services, are essential to improve maternal health and wellbeing and reduce maternal mortality.",

      "title": "A review of menopause nomenclature.",
      "abstract": "Menopause nomenclature varies in the scholarly literature making synthesis and interpretation of research findings difficult. Therefore, the present study aimed to review and discuss critical developments in menopause nomenclature; determine the level of heterogeneity amongst menopause definitions and compare them with the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria. Definitions/criteria used to characterise premenopausal and postmenopausal status were extracted from 210 studies and 128 of these studies were included in the final analyses. The main findings were that 39.84% of included studies were consistent with STRAW classification of premenopause, whereas 70.31% were consistent with STRAW classification of postmenopause. Surprisingly, major inconsistencies relating to premenopause definition were due to a total lack of reporting of any definitions/criteria for premenopause (39.84% of studies). In contrast, only 20.31% did not report definitions/criteria for postmenopause. The present findings indicate that there is a significant amount of heterogeneity associated with the definition of premenopause, compared with postmenopause. We propose three key suggestions/recommendations, which can be distilled from these findings. Firstly, premenopause should be transparently operationalised and reported. Secondly, as a minimum requirement, regular menstruation should be defined as the number of menstrual cycles in a period of at least 3 months. Finally, the utility of introducing normative age-ranges as supplementary criterion for defining stages of reproductive ageing should be considered. The use of consistent terminology in research will enhance our capacity to compare results from different studies and more effectively investigate issues related to women's health and ageing.",

      "abstract": "Religions continue to be a strong moral, even political, force in the world. They are often seen to be in conflict with women's health; we argue that this should not continue to be the case. The conflict can be traced back to when religions had their birth and early development in patriarchal communities in which women were marginalized to the edges of society. In addition, religious leadership has traditionally been dominated by men and exclusive of women. The recent introduction of new scientific technologies, which has empowered women to regulate and control their fertility, challenged traditional norms and raised a religious-inspired moral panic. However, a recent initiative has been gaining momentum. An enlightened religious leadership and a new generation of feminist religious activists are calling for a review of the original texts and a reinterpretation in a sociocultural context that is different from when they were first revealed. Obstetrician-gynecologists, while having to practice in a socioreligious context and continuing to face challenges in providing health care in religiously diverse societies, have a social responsibility to stand by women and to uphold that religions do not and should not stand in the way of advancing their health and rights.",

The objective of this study was to explore female physiology in a work-life context and to investigate possible associations between women's health, sickness absence and work ability. A scoping review was conducted to develop a systematic overview of the current research and to identify knowledge gaps. The search strategy was developed through a population, concept and context (PCC) model, and three areas of women's health were identified for investigation in the context of work. A total of 5798 articles were screened by title and abstract and 274 articles were screened by full text; 130 articles were included in the review. The material included research from 19 countries; the majority of the studies used quantitative methods. The results showed an impact on the occupational setting and an association between sickness absence, work ability and all three areas of women's health, but a holistic and overall perspective on female biology in the work context is missing. This review calls for more knowledge on health and work and possible gender differences in this regard. Women's health and working life involve a complex connection that has the potential to develop new knowledge.",

      "title": "Stages and future of women's health: A call for a life-course approach.",
      "abstract": "Over the years, discourse on women's health has skewed towards reproductive health, particularly on matters relating to maternal and child health, contraception, and pregnancy-related care. In spite of the relevance of these aspects, such a narrow perspective overlooks the broader spectrum of health concerns that affect women across different life stages, hence the need to refocus women's health through the lens of the life-course perspective. The life-course perspective is a framework for understanding human development that centers on time and space. From adolescence to old age, women encounter a wide array of health challenges and experiences, including non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mental health disorders, musculoskeletal conditions, and the long-term consequences of early-life exposures. Addressing these issues requires a paradigm shift toward a more comprehensive and inclusive approach that recognizes the lifelong nature of women's health needs. Rather than treating health issues in isolation, the life-course perspective considers how early-life exposures, social determinants, and lifestyle factors influence health trajectories over the life spectrum. For women, this means recognizing that adolescent health behaviors affect midlife disease risk, menopause has implications for cardiovascular and bone health, and older age brings unique challenges such as frailty and cognitive decline. This model underscores the importance of preventive care, early interventions, and tailored health services at every stage of life. Consequently, this editorial takes a life-course approach to highlight the dominant health and health-related realities of women, segmented into three cardinal phases: emerging adulthood, adulthood, and late adulthood. It concludes by drawing governments and the global community's attention to the need to focus healthcare systems on universal, gender-sensitive healthcare policies that guarantee accessible, affordable, and high-quality services tailored to women's needs at every stage of life. Policies and programs that support women at every stage of life must take center stage in the quest to create a future where all women, regardless of age or background, can achieve optimal health and well-being.",

This growth is being driven not only by new investigators who are moving into this area but also by the significant opportunities that have emerged in new methodologies, resources, and technologies in data science. Here, we describe some of the resources and methods being used by women's health researchers today to meet challenges in biomedical data science. We also describe the opportunities and limitations of applying these approaches to advance women's health outcomes and the future of the field, with emphasis on repurposing existing methodologies for women's health.",

Breast operations, labia reductions, and penis lengthening are long-established interventions, the motives for which a number of previous studies have examined. Tightening of the scrotum, by contrast, is a new trend in the aesthetic surgery market.

Participants were examined in terms of the number of lifetime sex partners they reported, nonrelationship partners, cheating or infidelity, and concurrent relationships. Intelligence and physical violence emerged as being especially likely to boost sex partner accumulation for the number of lifetime sex partners and nonrelationship partners in men. Intelligence also interacted positively with men's violence in cross-sectional models but not longitudinally. Women's violence was not significant regardless of the outcome or model specification. Intelligence showed less consistent effects for women's mating indicators compared to men. Analyses controlled for well-known correlates of aggression and sexual behavior and factors associated with beauty, including interviewer reports of survey participants' physical attractiveness and maturity, as well as self-reported attractiveness, maturity, and health. Findings are consistent with evolutionary ideas regarding costly signaling as an effective mating strategy among men.",

      "abstract": "This study draws on the theory of Social Semiotics and the methodology of Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to examine the textual and visual design of skincare advertisements targeted towards men. The current proliferation of the market for male-oriented facial products represents an important shift towards the increased attention to the beautification of male bodies in Western societies. Such beautification encourages men to work on and improve the self (and face) through intensifying practices of \"aesthetic labour.\" Aesthetic labour places emphasis on an entrepreneurial self-care and self-control regime that promotes an active late lifestyle fostered through ideas about \"successful ageing.\" As expected, the analysis of the corpus consisting of advertisements from L'Oréal Men, Nivea Men and Clarins Men shows that the male face is generally constructed as a \"problem\" that can be cured through the consumption of skincare products. The consumption of these products increases men's visual literacies of the face and hence normalises male beauty practices that seemingly encourage men to care for and work on their skin, which can be construed of as a feminising practice. Nonetheless, the advertisements employ masculine traits and strategies that link cosmetic products to traditional values of masculinity. The beautification of the male body, thus, turns the consumption of skincare products into a performance through which men can maintain their already privileged status in society, rearticulating the double standard of ageing (Sontag, 1972).",

      "abstract": "While there are studies regarding the neural correlates of human facial attractiveness, there are few investigations considering neural responses for body form attractiveness. The most prominent physical feature defining men's attractiveness is their physical fitness and upper body strength. Shoulder-to-hip ratio (SHR), a sexually dimorphic trait in humans, is an indicator of men's attractiveness for both men and women. The current study is the first to report on the neurophysiological responses to male and female body forms varying in SHR in healthy heterosexual men and women observers. Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals were acquired while participants completed an oddball task as well as a subsequent attractiveness judgement task. Behavioral results showed larger SHRs were considered more attractive than smaller SHRs, regardless of stimuli and participants' sex. The electrophysiological results for both the oddball task and the explicit judgement of attractiveness showed that brain activity related to male SHR body stimuli differed depending on the specific ratios, both at early and late processing stages. For female avatars, SHR did not modulate neural activity. Collectively the data implicate posterior brain regions in the perception of body forms that differ in attractiveness vis-a-vis variation of SHR, and frontal brain regions when such perceptions are rated explicitly.",

      "abstract": "Racial disparities in breast cancer are well-documented, and Black women assume a disproportionate burden of breast cancer mortality. Black women also commonly use hair products containing endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) more often at an increased rate, as compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Emerging findings have reported the use of hair and other personal care products containing EDCs may contribute to breast cancer risk. While some sociocultural perspectives about hair and identity have been explored, the role of beauty expectations upheld by males has not been studied. Through a community-based participatory methodology, we explored perceptions and beliefs held by Black men regarding Black women's hair, chemical exposures in hair products, and breast cancer risk. Focus groups and key informant interviews-among men with and without partners with a history of breast cancer-were used to examine the male perspective regarding the attractiveness of Black hairstyles, opinions of beauty norms, and knowledge of breast cancer risk factors. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed guided by grounded theory methods. From the 66 participants interviewed, there was general support for natural hairstyles, which were associated with confidence and self-esteem in women. Men agreed that beauty standards and societal pressures play notable roles in the women's personal behaviors though they mostly lacked knowledge of women's breast cancer risk related to EDCs found in personal care products. Participants suggested a multipronged strategy centered on community education involving social and traditional media campaigns, and the engagement of policy makers in intervention efforts.",

      "abstract": "Previously documented sexual response patterns of gender-specificity among gynephilic men and gender-nonspecificity among gynephilic women could be explained by women responding more strongly to non-gendered aspects of sexual stimuli. Cues of attractiveness are known determinants of sexual decision-making, yet have not been directly tested as determinants of sexual response. The current study investigated the role of attractiveness cues in explaining gender-based patterns of sexual response. Thirty-one gynephilic men and 60 androphilic women were presented slideshows of images depicting individual nude men and women that were pre-rated in a pilot study as either attractive or unattractive. The men and women were posed with legs spread and aroused genitals displayed prominently. Images were isolated against a white background and included minimal contextual information. Three sexual responses - genital arousal (via photoplethysmographs), self-reported arousal, and visual attention (via eye-tracking) - were recorded continuously. Across all three response modalities, men's and women's responses were stronger for the attractive versus unattractive images and for their preferred versus non-preferred gender. For men's arousal and women's self-reported arousal, the effect of attractiveness was stronger for their preferred versus non-preferred gender. Thus, both men and women demonstrated preference-specific patterns of sexual response. Gender cues had the strongest effect on men's visual attention, whereas attractiveness cues had the strongest effect on women's visual attention. Findings establish the importance of target attractiveness in arousal to sexual stimuli and add to mounting evidence that androphilic women's sexual responses are sensitive to gender, but may be more sensitive to non-gendered features of sexual stimuli.",

Historically, women have been the main target of sociocultural pressures. However, research has recently suggested that self-objectification is a male phenomenon as well, which can be inscribed in men's body experiences. Nevertheless, fewer studies have specifically focused on the male experience and general consequences of body-objectification are yet to be extensively analyzed regarding males' body image features. The current cross-sectional study explores the consequences of body-objectification on male body esteem, specifically testing the predictive role of exercising/dietary habits, body-objectification features, and SNS-related practices on male body esteem.",

      "abstract": "Research shows negative correlations between media exposure of body images in the context of hegemonic beauty ideals and body satisfaction. The present study deals with the underlying mechanisms and the effects of different exposure contents. In the online experimental study, a sample consisting of 226 individuals (82.3% female, 17.7% male) received a three-minute exposure to Instagram images of women and men in the context of either hegemonic beauty ideals in the experimental group or body diversity in the control group. A conducted Mixed ANOVA with repeated measures showed significant group differences, including an increase in body dissatisfaction in the experimental group and a reduction in the control group after exposure. Statistically significant detrimental effects of exposure to images in the experimental group on women's state mood as well as descriptive similar tendencies on men's state mood were found. Moderating effects of the tendency to make upward social comparisons and the internalization of the gender-specific beauty ideal on the relationship between exposure content and the change scores of body dissatisfaction were found. Furthermore, a mediation model was calculated to investigate the effect of exposure content on post-measurement of body dissatisfaction, using the constructs \"comparison processes regarding sexual attractiveness\" and \"assessment of one's own sexual attractiveness\" as mediators. The model did not yield significant mediation, although significant relationships were found between the model components. Exploratory analyses were conducted on the influence of the assessment of one's own sexual attractiveness on related social comparisons and the intensity of engagement with Instagram content as a predictor of body dissatisfaction. The results highlight the relevance for psychoeducational purposes of addressing a critical engagement with depicted beauty ideals in social media. Moreover, the study proposes body diversity as an alternative content that can have a positive impact on body satisfaction, which can be actively sought during the individual Instagram user experience.",

      "title": "Women Walk in High Heels: Lumbar Curvature, Dynamic Motion Stimuli and Attractiveness.",
      "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the angle of women's lumbar curvature affects men's attractiveness judgments of them. The theoretically optimal angle of lumbar curvature provides better resistance against both hyperlordosis and hypolordosis as biomechanical costs of a bipedal fetal load that could impair a woman's fertility. Since men find this attribute attractive, women aim to emphasize it by wearing high-heeled shoes. The primary objective of the present study was to test this evolutionary hypothesis using short videos presenting women walking by the camera. In line with previous findings based on static stimuli (photographs), dynamic stimuli (videos) presenting women walking in high-heeled shoes were expected to elicit increased attractiveness ratings as compared to women wearing flat shoes, which would be associated with the angle of lumbar curvature. Videos were taken of 52 female models walking in two conditions (i.e., wearing either high-heeled or flat shoes). A total of 108 participants (61 males, 47 females) rated the walking models' physical attractiveness in an online setting. Each model's lumbar curvature was measured both in high heels and in flat shoes using photographs taken of them prior to each video recording. The results showed that wearing high heels consistently increased the models' attractiveness, regardless of whether or not it decreased their natural difference from the theoretically optimal angle of lumbar curvature. Both male and female observers showed this positive effect. Furthermore, a negative correlation was found between the models' body mass index (BMI) and their perceived attractiveness scores in both conditions.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are more attractive are thought to show a greater preference for facial sexual dimorphism, potentially because individuals who perceive themselves as more physically attractive believe they will be better able to attract and/or retain sexually dimorphic partners. Evidence for this link is mixed, however, and recent research suggests the association between self-rated attractiveness and preferences for facial sexual dimorphism may not generalise to non-Western cultures. Here, we assess whether self-rated attractiveness and self-rated health predict facial sexual dimorphism preferences in a large and culturally diverse sample of 6907 women and 2851 men from 41 countries. We also investigated whether ecological factors, such as country health/development and inequality, might moderate this association. Our analyses found that men and women who rated themselves as more physically attractive reported stronger preferences for exaggerated sex-typical characteristics in other-sex faces. This finding suggests that associations between self-rated attractiveness and preferences for sexually dimorphic facial characteristics generalise to a culturally diverse sample and exist independently of country-level factors. We also found that country health/development moderated the effect of men's self-rated attractiveness on femininity preferences, such that men from countries with high health/development showed a positive association between self-rated attractiveness and femininity preference, while men from countries with low health/development showed the opposite trend.",

Here we investigated (1) how women's first impressions of potential partners' physical attractiveness and potential for abusive behaviour based on face images influence hypothetical dating decisions and (2) possible moderating effects of individual differences in women's sensation seeking, sociosexual orientation (i.e., openness to uncommitted sexual relationships), current partnership status, and self-perceived mate value (i.e., self-rated attractiveness). Physical attractiveness of potential dates, but not perceptions of potential for abusive behaviour, was a strong predictor of reported dating intentions, but this effect of physical attractiveness was weaker among women who scored higher on sensation seeking. None of the other individual-difference variables had significant effects. Collectively, these findings present further evidence for the importance of physical attractiveness in dating and partner choices and highlight the role sensation seeking appears to play in individual differences in the effect of men's physical attractiveness on women's dating intentions.",

      "title": "Global consensus on optimal exercise recommendations for enhancing healthy longevity in older adults (ICFSR).",
      "abstract": "Aging, a universal and inevitable process, is characterized by a progressive accumulation of physiological alterations and functional decline over time, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately mortality as age advances. Lifestyle factors, notably physical activity (PA) and exercise, significantly modulate aging phenotypes. Physical activity and exercise can prevent or ameliorate lifestyle-related diseases, extend health span, enhance physical function, and reduce the burden of non-communicable chronic diseases including cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, and chronic respiratory diseases as well as premature mortality. Physical activity influences the cellular and molecular drivers of biological aging, slowing aging rates-a foundational aspect of geroscience. Thus, PA serves both as preventive medicine and therapeutic agent in pathological states. Sub-optimal PA levels correlate with increased disease prevalence in aging populations. Structured exercise prescriptions should therefore be customized and monitored like any other medical treatment, considering the dose-response relationships and specific adaptations necessary for intended outcomes. Current guidelines recommend a multifaceted exercise regimen that includes aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility training through structured and incidental (integrated lifestyle) activities. Tailored exercise programs have proven effective in helping older adults maintain their functional capacities, extending their health span, and enhancing their quality of life. Particularly important are anabolic exercises, such as Progressive resistance training (PRT), which are indispensable for maintaining or improving functional capacity in older adults, particularly those with frailty, sarcopenia or osteoporosis, or those hospitalized or in residential aged care. Multicomponent exercise interventions that include cognitive tasks significantly enhance the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, and energy) and cognitive function, thus preventing falls and optimizing functional capacity during aging. Importantly, PA/exercise displays dose-response characteristics and varies between individuals, necessitating personalized modalities tailored to specific medical conditions. Precision in exercise prescriptions remains a significant area of further research, given the global impact of aging and broad effects of PA. Economic analyses underscore the cost benefits of exercise programs, justifying broader integration into health care for older adults. However, despite these benefits, exercise is far from fully integrated into medical practice for older people. Many healthcare professionals, including geriatricians, need more training to incorporate exercise directly into patient care, whether in settings including hospitals, outpatient clinics, or residential care. Education about the use of exercise as isolated or adjunctive treatment for geriatric syndromes and chronic diseases would do much to ease the problems of polypharmacy and widespread prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. This intersection of prescriptive practices and PA/exercise offers a promising approach to enhance the well-being of older adults. An integrated strategy that combines exercise prescriptions with pharmacotherapy would optimize the vitality and functional independence of older people whilst minimizing adverse drug reactions. This consensus provides the rationale for the integration of PA into health promotion, disease prevention, and management strategies for older adults. Guidelines are included for specific modalities and dosages of exercise with proven efficacy in randomized controlled trials. Descriptions of the beneficial physiological changes, attenuation of aging phenotypes, and role of exercise in chronic disease and disability management in older adults are provided. The use of exercise in cardiometabolic disease, cancer, musculoskeletal conditions, frailty, sarcopenia, and neuropsychological health is emphasized. Recommendations to bridge existing knowledge and implementation gaps and fully integrate PA into the mainstream of geriatric care are provided. Particular attention is paid to the need for personalized medicine as it applies to exercise and geroscience, given the inter-individual variability in adaptation to exercise demonstrated in older adult cohorts. Overall, this consensus provides a foundation for applying and extending the current knowledge base of exercise as medicine for an aging population to optimize health span and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with kidney failure undergoing hemodialysis experience physical deconditioning and multimorbidity. Exercise interventions may mitigate this outcome, but their clinical role is unclear. METHODS: This multicenter, cluster randomized controlled trial evaluated combined endurance and resistance exercise training during hemodialysis versus usual care in chronic kidney failure. It assessed physical functioning, quality of life, hospitalizations, and overall survival. The primary outcome was the change in the 60-second sit-to-stand test (STS60) between baseline and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 1211 patients underwent randomization, 917 (65.9±14.4 years; 38.9% female) of whom were included in the full analysis (exercise intervention, n=446; usual care, n=471). At 12 months, the STS60 repetitions improved from 16.2±7.6 to 19.2±9.1 in the exercise group but declined from 16.2±7.1 to 14.7±7.9 in the usual care group (group difference, 3.85 repetitions; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.22 to 5.48; P<0.0001). The timed up-and-go test (−1.1 seconds; 95% CI, −1.9 to −0.3) and the 6-minute walk test (37.5 m; 95% CI, 14.7 to 60.4) also differed in the exercise group versus usual care group. The physical summary score and vitality subscale of the quality of life questionnaire (i.e., the 36-item Short Form Health Survey) differed in the exercise group versus usual care group, but the other subscales did not change. Adverse events during dialysis sessions were similar in both groups. Median days spent in the hospital annually were 2 in the exercise group and 5 in the usual care group. Mortality and dialysis-specific adverse events were not affected. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve months of intradialytic exercise in patients with kidney failure significantly improved the STS60 compared with usual care.

      "abstract": "Intrinsic capacity (IC), the composite of physical and mental capacities, declines with age at different rates and patterns between individuals. We aimed to investigate the association between longitudinal IC trajectories and plasma biomarkers of two hallmarks of aging-chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction-in older adults. From the Multidomain Alzheimer Preventive Trial (MAPT), we included 1271 community-dwelling older people (mean [SD] age = 76.0 [4.3] years) with IC data over four years. Group-based multi-trajectory modeling was performed to identify clusters of the participants with similar longitudinal patterns across four IC domains: cognition, locomotion, psychology, and vitality. Five IC multi-trajectory groups were determined: low in all domains (8.4%), low locomotion (24.6%), low psychological domain (16.7%), robust (i.e., high in all domains except vitality; 28.3%), and robust with high vitality (22.0%). Compared to the best trajectory group (i.e., robust with high vitality), elevated levels of plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1), and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) were associated with a higher risk of belonging to the \"low in all domains\" group (IL-6: relative risk ratio (RRR) [95% CI] = 1.42 [1.07 - 1.88]; TNFR-1: RRR = 1.46 [1.09 - 1.96]; GDF-15: RRR = 1.99 [1.45 - 2.73]). Higher IL-6 and GDF-15 also increased the risk of being in the \"low locomotion\" group. GDF-15 outperformed other biomarkers by showing the strongest associations with IC trajectory groups. Our findings found that plasma biomarkers reflecting inflammation and mitochondrial impairment distinguished older people with multi-impaired IC trajectories from those with high-stable IC.",

Applying multilevel growth curve models, we found that more recent cohorts entered older ages with higher levels of capacity, while subsequent age-related declines were somewhat compressed compared to earlier cohorts. Trends were most evident for the cognitive, locomotor and vitality capacities. Improvements were large, with the greatest gains being in the most recent cohorts. For example, a 68-year-old participant of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing born in 1950 had higher capacity than a 62-year-old born 10 years earlier. Trends were similar for men and women and were generally consistent across English and Chinese cohorts. Possible causes include broad societal influences and improvements in medical care.",

However, real-life data informing on how IC domains cluster and change over time, as well as their clinical utility, are lacking. Using primary healthcare screening data from more than 20,000 French adults 60 years of age or older, this study identified four clusters of IC impairment: 'Low impairment' (most prevalent), 'Cognition+Locomotion+Hearing+Vision', 'All IC impaired' and 'Psychology+Vitality+Vision'. Compared to individuals with 'Low impairment', those in the other clusters had higher likelihood of having frailty and limitations in both activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), with the strongest associations being observed for 'All IC impaired'. This study found that ICOPE screening might be a useful tool for patient risk stratification in clinical practice, with a higher number of IC domains impaired at screening indicating a higher probability of functional decline.",

      "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by the senescence and declining vitality of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs), often driven by mitochondrial dysfunction. This study elucidates that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a crucial role in attenuating NPC senescence by secreting mitochondria-containing microvesicles (mitoMVs). Moreover, it demonstrates that static magnetic fields (SMF) enhance the secretion of mitoMVs by MSCs. By distinguishing mitoMV generation from exosomes, this study shifts focus to understanding the molecular mechanisms of SMF intervention, emphasizing cargo transport and plasma membrane budding processes, with RNA sequencing indicating the potential involvement of the microtubule-based transport protein Kif5b. The study further confirms the interaction between Rab22a and Kif5b, revealing Rab22a's role in sorting mitoMVs into microvesicles (MVs) and potentially mediating subsequent plasma membrane budding. Subsequent construction of a gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel delivery system further addresses the challenges of in vivo application and verifies the substantial potential of mitoMVs in delaying IVDD. This research not only sheds light on the molecular intricacies of SMF-enhanced mitoMV secretion but also provides innovative perspectives for future IVDD therapeutic strategies.",

Clinical studies have employed different instruments, including standardized and disease-specific questionnaires, and including patients with different phenotypes of PHPT. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and decline in cognitive status are common in PHPT. Patients may complain of these issues or they can be ascertained by questionnaires; they include depression, anxiety, impaired vitality, social and emotional functions, sleep disturbances, and altered mental function. Randomized controlled trials on the effects of surgical versus non-surgical treatments have collectively shown improvement in quality of life after parathyroidectomy, but results have been heterogeneous.",

      "abstract": "The global decline in sperm quality in men is closely associated with environmental exposure to the plasticizer Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), but the molecular mechanisms underlying its induction of asthenozoospermia (AZS) remain incompletely understood. By integrating the toxicological targets of DEHP and differential genes in AZS patients, and combining machine learning, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations, this study successfully identified hub genes and signaling pathways induced by DEHP in AZS, aiming to provide new strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease. A total of 26 toxicological targets were identified, with FGFR1, MMP7, and ST14 clearly defined as playing crucial regulatory roles in DEHP-induced AZS. This study also reveals that DEHP may induce reproductive system inflammation, affecting the proliferation and survival of reproductive cells, and subsequently impacting sperm vitality, possibly through regulating the mTORC1 pathway, TNF-α signaling via the NF-κB pathway, and MYC targets v1 pathway. Furthermore, changes in the immune microenvironment revealed the significant impact of immune status on testicular function. In conclusion, this study provides important scientific evidence for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AZS and developing prevention and treatment strategies based on toxicological targets.",

      "title": "The role of the medial prefrontal cortex in cognition, ageing and dementia.",
      "abstract": "Humans require a plethora of higher cognitive skills to perform executive functions, such as reasoning, planning, language and social interactions, which are regulated predominantly by the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex comprises the lateral, medial and orbitofrontal regions. In higher primates, the lateral prefrontal cortex is further separated into the respective dorsal and ventral subregions. However, all these regions have variably been implicated in several fronto-subcortical circuits. Dysfunction of these circuits has been highlighted in vascular and other neurocognitive disorders. Recent advances suggest the medial prefrontal cortex plays an important regulatory role in numerous cognitive functions, including attention, inhibitory control, habit formation and working, spatial or long-term memory. The medial prefrontal cortex appears highly interconnected with subcortical regions (thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus) and exerts top-down executive control over various cognitive domains and stimuli. Much of our knowledge comes from rodent models using precise lesions and electrophysiology readouts from specific medial prefrontal cortex locations. Although, anatomical disparities of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex compared to the primate homologue are apparent, current rodent models have effectively implicated the medial prefrontal cortex as a neural substrate of cognitive decline within ageing and dementia. Human brain connectivity-based neuroimaging has demonstrated that large-scale medial prefrontal cortex networks, such as the default mode network, are equally important for cognition. However, there is little consensus on how medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity specifically changes during brain pathological states. In context with previous work in rodents and non-human primates, we attempt to convey a consensus on the current understanding of the role of predominantly the medial prefrontal cortex and its functional connectivity measured by resting-state functional MRI in ageing associated disorders, including prodromal dementia states, Alzheimer's disease, post-ischaemic stroke, Parkinsonism and frontotemporal dementia. Previous cross-sectional studies suggest that medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity abnormalities are consistently found in the default mode network across both ageing and neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular cognitive impairment. Distinct disease-specific patterns of medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity alterations within specific large-scale networks appear to consistently feature in the default mode network, whilst detrimental connectivity alterations are associated with cognitive impairments independently from structural pathological aberrations, such as grey matter atrophy. These disease-specific patterns of medial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity also precede structural pathological changes and may be driven by ageing-related vascular mechanisms. The default mode network supports utility as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for dementia-associated conditions. Yet, these associations still require validation in longitudinal studies using larger sample sizes.",

      "abstract": "Male fertility and semen quality have declined over recent decades. Among other causes, exposure to environmental and occupational pollution has been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, but effects on male semen quality are still uncertain. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess current evidence regarding the impact of exposure to tobacco smoke and environmental and occupational pollution on sperm quality in humans. In the meta-analysis, 22 studies are included showing that environmental and occupational pollutants may affect sperm count, volume, concentration, motility, vitality and sperm DNA, and chromatin integrity. All included articles reported significant alterations in at least one of the outcomes studied in association with at least one of the pollutants studied. Considering that sperm quality can be considered a proxy for general health and that pollutants have a dramatic impact on climate change, it would be strongly recommended to better understand the role of pollutants on human, animal, and planetary health.",

      "title": "Supporting Resilience of Older Adults with Cognitive Decline Requires a Multi-Level System Approach.",
      "abstract": "The concept of resilience, i.e., the capacity of a system to bounce back after a stressor, is gaining interest across many fields of science, policy, and practice. To date, resilience research in people with cognitive decline has predominantly addressed the early stages of decline. We propose that: (1) resilience is a relevant concept in all stages of cognitive decline; and (2) a socio-ecological, multisystem perspective on resilience is required to advance understanding of, and care and support for people with cognitive decline and their support networks. We substantiate our position with literature and examples. Resilience helps understand differences in response to risk factors of (further) cognitive decline and informs personalised prevention. In a curative context, interventions to strengthen resilience aim to boost recovery from cognitive decline. In care for people with dementia, resilience-focused interventions can strengthen coping mechanisms to maintain functioning and well-being of the individual and their support network. A good example of improving resilience in the social and policy context is the introduction of age-friendly cities and dementia-friendly communities. Good care for people with cognitive decline requires a health and social care system that can adapt to changes in demand. Given the interdependency of resilience at micro-, meso- and macro-levels, an integrative socio-ecological perspective is required. Applying the concept of resilience in the field of cognitive decline opens new horizons for research to improve understanding, predicting, intervening on health and social care needs for the increasing population with cognitive decline.",

      "title": "Duration of Neurocognitive Impairment With Medical Cannabis Use: A Scoping Review.",
      "abstract": "While the recreational use of cannabis has well-established dose-dependent effects on neurocognitive and psychomotor functioning, there is little consensus on the degree and duration of impairment typically seen with medical marijuana use. Compared to recreational cannabis users, medical cannabis patients have distinct characteristics that may modify the presence and extent of impairment. The goal of this review was to determine the duration of acute neurocognitive impairment associated with medical cannabis use, and to identify differences between medical cannabis patients and recreational users. These findings are used to gain insight on how medical professionals can best advise medical cannabis patients with regards to automobile driving or safety-sensitive tasks at work. A systematic electronic search for English language randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical trials and systematic reviews (in order to capture any potentially missed RCTs) between 2000 and 2019 was conducted through Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases using MeSH terms. Articles were limited to medical cannabis patients using cannabis for chronic non-cancer pain or spasticity. After screening titles and abstracts, 37 relevant studies were subjected to full-text review. Overall, seven controlled trials met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis: six RCTs and one observational clinical trial. Neurocognitive testing varied significantly between all studies, including the specific tests administered and the timing of assessments post-cannabis consumption. In general, cognitive performance declined mostly in a THC dose-dependent manner, with steady resolution of impairment in the hours following THC administration. Doses of THC were lower than those typically reported in recreational cannabis studies. In all the studies, there was no difference between any of the THC groups and placebo on any neurocognitive measure after 4 h of recovery. Variability in the dose-dependent relationship raises the consideration that there are other important factors contributing to the duration of neurocognitive impairment besides the dose of THC ingested. These modifiable and non-modifiable factors are individually discussed.",

      "abstract": "An essential pathogenic element of acute limb ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is microvascular dysfunction. The majority of studies indicates that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) exhibits protective properties in cases of acute I/R injury. Albeit its specific role in the context of acute limb I/R injury is yet unknown. An impressive post-reperfusion increase in FGF2 expression was seen in a mouse model of hind limb I/R, followed by a decline to baseline levels, suggesting a key role for FGF2 in limb survivability. FGF2 appeared to reduce I/R-induced hypoperfusion, tissue edema, skeletal muscle fiber injury, as well as microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) damage within the limb, according to assessments of limb vitality, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence results. The bioinformatics analysis of RNA-sequencing revealed that ferroptosis played a key role in FGF2-facilitated limb preservation. Pharmacological inhibition of NFE2L2 prevented ECs from being affected by FGF2's anti-oxidative and anti-ferroptosis activities. Additionally, silencing of kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) by interfering RNA eliminated the antioxidant and anti-ferroptosis effects of FGF2 on ECs. Further research revealed that the AMPK-HDAC5 signal pathway is the mechanism via which FGF2 regulates KLF2 activity. Data from luciferase assays demonstrated that overexpression of HDAC5 prevented KLF2 from becoming activated by FGF2. Collectively, FGF2 protects microvascular ECs from I/R injury by KLF2-mediated ferroptosis inhibition and antioxidant responses.",

NMN significantly improves recovery from aging-related diseases, such as diminished heart function, reduced fertility, memory decline, and diabetes. NMN demonstrates both efficacy and safety in anti-aging. The use of NMN in China has gradually gained acceptance, highlighting the importance of exploring the mechanism of NMN in anti-aging effects and improving the biosynthesis of NMN. In addition, NMN in combination with stem cells hold promise in the treatment of aging-related degenerative diseases and promote overall human and animal health.",

      "abstract": "Degenerative aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease among the elderly. Once cardiac symptoms occur, current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement. Progressive degeneration/calcification reduces leaflet mobility with gradual cardiac output (CO) impairment. Low CO might induce abnormal brain-aging with cognitive impairment and increased risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. On the contrary, cognitive improvement has been reported in patients in whom CO was restored. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has proven to be a safe alternative to conventional surgery, with a similar mid-term survival and stroke risk even in low-risk patients. TAVI is associated with an immediate CO improvement, also effecting the cerebrovascular system, leading to an increased cerebral blood flow. The correlation between TAVI and cognitive improvement is still debated. The present study aims at evaluating this relationship in a cohort of AS patients where cognitive assessment before and after TAVI was available.",

      "abstract": "Exposure to air pollutants is known to be an important risk factor in reducing semen quality in men across the world. Poor semen quality results in decline in the global fertility rate and significant personal stress, dysfunctional sexual relationships, and psychosocial problems. Continuous monitoring and effective efforts to reduce air pollution in industries and the environment and making positive changes in daily lifestyle can prevent adverse effects on semen quality and reduce the high prevalence of men infertility. This review aims to summarize studies associating pollutant concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), formaldehyde (FA), and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylene) on semen quality. In this systematic review, Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched until November 13, 2022. The PECO statement was formulated to clarify the research question, and articles that did not satisfy the criteria outlined in this statement were excluded. Generally, 497 articles were obtained through searching databases, and after the investigations, 26 articles that met the entry criteria were extracted and finally considered in the systematic review. The results showed that occupational and environmental exposures to PAHs, formaldehyde, and BTEX were associated with increased metabolite concentration of toxic pollutants in body fluids. These toxin-associated pollutants directly or indirectly cause detrimental effects on sperm motility, vitality, DNA fragmentation, and morphology. There is evidence on the impact of PAHs, formaldehyde, and BTEX pollutants on the reduction of semen quality. Therefore, proving the relationship between air pollutants and testicular function in semen quality can play an effective role in macro policies and adopting stricter laws to reduce the emission of air pollutants and promote a healthy lifestyle to improve reproductive health in young men.",

      "abstract": "Dementia has been characterized by atypical neurological syndromes and several cognitive deficits, such as extended memory loss, strange behavior, unusual thinking, impaired judgment, impotence, and difficulty with daily living activities. Dementia is not a disease, but it is caused by several neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lewy's bodies. Several drugs and remedies are indicated for alleviating unusual cognitive decline, but no effective pharmacological treatment regimens are available without side effects. Herbal drugs or traditional medicines like Ayurveda have been known for facilitating and corroborating the balance between mind, brain, body, and environment. Ayurvedic therapy comprises 600 herbal formulas, 250 single plant remedies, and natural and holistic health-giving treatments that relieve dementia in patients and increase vitality. Ayurvedic Rasayana herbs [rejuvenating elements] strengthen the brain cells, enhance memory, and decrease stress. The current medicine scenario in the treatment of dementia has prompted the shift in exploring the efficacy of ayurvedic medicine, its safety, and its efficiency. This review presents the literature on several herbal treatments for improving dementia symptomatology and patients' quality of life.",

However, assessing IC is resource-intensive, and the molecular and cellular bases of its decline are poorly understood. Here we used the INSPIRE-T cohort (1,014 individuals aged 20-102 years) to construct the IC clock, a DNA methylation-based predictor of IC, trained on the clinical evaluation of cognition, locomotion, psychological well-being, sensory abilities and vitality. In the Framingham Heart Study, DNA methylation IC outperforms first-generation and second-generation epigenetic clocks in predicting all-cause mortality, and it is strongly associated with changes in molecular and cellular immune and inflammatory biomarkers, functional and clinical endpoints, health risk factors and lifestyle choices. These findings establish the IC clock as a validated tool bridging molecular readouts of aging and clinical assessments of IC.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to provide an overview on the relation between vision and generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in general populations worldwide. We conducted a systematic review to identify articles that have evaluated the relation of binocularly measured distance visual acuity (VA) and HRQoL in adults at population level around the world. Used search terms were related to visual acuity, vision loss, visual impairment and HRQoL. We identified 780 articles, of which 12 satisfied the eligibility criteria. The studies were conducted in the USA, Europe, Asia and Australia. Generic HRQoL was measured using EQ-5D, 15D, SF-36, SF-12 and/or WHOQoL. Nine studies reported a trend between decreasing VA and deteriorating HRQoL of at least some degree. Vision loss was mostly associated with dimensions related to physical health and capability, including self-care, mobility and usual activities. Mental dimensions - vitality and social functioning in particular - were also affected, although the results were inconsistent. Six studies compared the impact of different medical conditions on HRQoL, all of which reported that the impact of visual impairment was equal or stronger compared with other major medical conditions. In conclusion, generic HRQoL instruments are sensitive to detect the relation between vision and HRQoL, as they cover dimensions influenced by vision. Declining vision is associated with reduced functioning, which leads to dependence and isolation - both major factors in an individual's well-being. This phenomenon showed surprising similarity around the world and therefore emphasises the global burden of vision loss at both individual and societal level and encourages its prevention and treatment.",

AGA presents itself in a characteristic distribution unique to both sexes. Despite its prevalence, AGA can be quite challenging to treat. The condition is chronic in nature and stems from an interplay of genetic and environmental factors. There are only two US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for the condition: topical minoxidil and oral finasteride. However, numerous non-FDA-approved treatments have been shown to be effective in treating AGA in various studies. Some of these treatments are relatively new and still to be explored, thus emphasizing the need for an updated review of the literature. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the evaluation of AGA and the mechanisms of action, costs, efficacies, and safety profiles of existing, alternative, and upcoming therapeutics for this widespread condition.",

Relevant articles on AGA from PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline and Scopus from 1950 to 2024 were obtained and scrutinized.. Key search words included each term like 'androgenetic alopecia', 'androgenic alopecia', 'pattern baldness' and 'pattern hair loss' AND each term like 'epidemiology', 'pathophysiology', 'genetics', 'hormones', 'micronutrient', 'stress and inflammation', 'growth factors', 'clinical features', 'staging', 'cardiovascular associations', 'diagnosis' and 'management' were used in the search. AGA is a non-scarring hair loss that is exemplified by a progressive decline of hair follicles, or non-functional or dead hair follicles in the scalp in a defined pattern. It is the most common hair loss, more common in men but can also present in younger age as premature AGA. Hormones, genetics, micronutrient deficiency, microinflammation and stress have been implicated, while psychosocial distress and cutaneous correlate of cardiovascular diseases have become sources of relentless research. AGA is a patterned hair loss that is more prevalent in Men. It results from the interactions between hormonal, genetic and other factors which determine the extent of hair loss and associated disorders (psychosocial and cardiovascular). As results of more research become available, the extent of AGA, its comorbidities as well as the full spectrum of their manifestations will continue to be sources of health education and more holistic examination by dermatologists and patients.",

Therefore, natural products may be an alternative when patients are skeptical about these two conventional treatments. Physicians may also suggest natural products in conjunction with topical minoxidil or oral finasteride to enhance clinical outcomes. This article reviews the prospect of natural products in treating male AGA. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE (Ovid) on July 19, 2021. In addition, the bibliographies of selected articles were hand-searched to identify relevant studies. After deduplication and screening, 11 clinical studies meet the criteria for detailed review. The selected clinical studies suggest that saw palmetto, caffeine, melatonin, marine extracts, rosemary oil, procyanidin, pumpkin seed oil, and cannabidiol oil might be considered in male AGA treatment.",

      "abstract": "Female androgenetic alopecia or female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) is highly prevalent and has a great impact on the quality of life. The treatment is a routine challenge in dermatological practice, as many therapeutic options have a limited level of evidence and often do not meet patients expectations. Lack of knowledge of the pathogenesis of the hair miniaturization process and the factors that regulate follicular morphogenesis restricts the prospect of innovative therapies. There is also a lack of randomized, controlled studies with longitudinal follow-up, using objective outcomes and exploring the performance of the available treatments and their combinations. Topical minoxidil, which has been used to treat female pattern hair loss since the 1990s, is the only medication that has a high level of evidence and remains the first choice. However, about 40% of patients do not show improvement with this treatment. In this article, the authors critically discuss the main clinical and surgical therapeutic alternatives for FPHL, as well as present camouflage methods that can be used in more extensive or unresponsive cases.",

In Part 1 of this 2-part review, we describe how the techniques employed in hair transplantation have evolved into their present forms. Anatomic concepts of specific relevance for dermatologists are discussed, including the distribution and ex vivo morphology of scalp follicular units. Male androgenetic alopecia and female pattern hair loss are the most common reasons for hair loss consultations with dermatologists and will be the primary focus of this review. However, because not all hair disorders are suitable for transplantation, this review will also describe which scalp conditions are amenable to surgery and which are not. Guidelines are provided to help dermatologists better define good and bad candidates for hair transplantation. Other conditions for which hair transplantation surgery is indicated are reviewed.",

Generally, the occurrence of AGA has long been thought to be driven by genetic and androgen predisposition. However, increasingly, data proposed ageing and AGA are intimately linked. Elevated senescent cell burden and androgen and oxidative stress-induced senescence mechanisms in ageing may be initial targets to improve AGA. This review summarizes the biological links between ageing and AGA, with special focus on cellular senescence. In addition, we discuss the potential therapeutic strategies for improving cellular senescence in AGA, such as inhibiting dermal papilla cells and hair follicle stem cells senescence driven by androgen and reactive oxygen species, removing senescent cell, and reducing senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).",

Several studies have shown that PRP can be used effectively for treatment of hair loss. Although it has been widely used, the exact mechanism of action of PRP is still not fully elucidated. In this article, we aim to review and update current information on the definition, classification, mechanism of action, clinical efficacy in hair regrowth, and adverse events of PRP.",

      "abstract": "More than 80 million people in the United States are affected by hair loss, also known as alopecia. Nonscarring alopecias are categorized as diffuse, patterned, or focal. Diffuse alopecias include telogen and anagen effluvium, are usually self-limited, and depend on stopping the underlying cause (e.g., stress). Patterned hair loss, specifically androgenetic alopecia, is the most common form of alopecia; it is typically genetic, and first-line treatment is minoxidil. Oral finasteride is another treatment available for male patients. Focal hair loss includes alopecia areata, which is typically self-limited and treated with intralesional corticosteroid or oral immunosuppressant therapy; tinea capitis, which is treated with oral antifungals; and traction alopecia, which is treated by decreasing tension on the hair. Hair loss can be caused by several systemic diseases. A comprehensive history and physical examination, with targeted laboratory testing, may elucidate malnutrition, autoimmune diseases, and endocrine disease. Patients with moderate to severe hair loss are more likely to have accompanying anxiety, depression, and lower work productivity and quality-of-life scores. Educating patients about expected hair changes, treatment options, and realistic outcomes can help patients feel that they are being listened to and that their hair loss is being taken seriously.",

This can have a significant impact on a person's psychological well-being, which can lead to a decreased quality of life. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of using stem cells in androgenic alopecia. The search was conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The review was performed on data pertaining to the efficacy of using different types of stem cells in androgenic alopecia: quantitative results of stem cell usage were compared to the control treatment or, different types of treatment for female and male androgenetic alopecia. Of the outcomes, the density of hair was analyzed. Fourteen articles were selected for this review. During and after treatment with stem cells, no major side effects were reported by patients with alopecia. The use of stem cells in androgenic alopecia seems to be a promising alternative to the standard treatment or it could play the role of complementary therapy to improve the effect of primary treatment. However, these results should be interpreted with caution until they can be reproduced in larger and more representative samples.",

      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) management is a significant clinical and therapeutic challenge for transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) patients. Although gender-affirming hormone therapies affect hair growth, there is little research about AGA in TGD populations. After reviewing the literature on approved treatments, off-label medication usages, and procedures for treating AGA, we present treatment options for AGA in TGD patients. The first-line treatments for any TGD patient include topical minoxidil 5% applied to the scalp once or twice daily, finasteride 1 mg oral daily, and/or low-level laser light therapy. Spironolactone 200 mg daily is also first-line for transfeminine patients. Second-line options include daily oral minoxidil dosed at 1.25 or 2.5 mg for transfeminine and transmasculine patients, respectively. Topical finasteride 0.25% monotherapy or in combination with minoxidil 2% solution are second-line options for transmasculine and transfeminine patients, respectively. Other second-line treatments for any TGD patient include oral dutasteride 0.5 mg daily, platelet-rich plasma, or hair restoration procedures. After 6-12 months of treatment, AGA severity and treatment progress should be assessed via scales not based on sex; eg, the Basic and Specific Classification or the Bouhanna scales. Dermatologists should coordinate care with the patient's primary gender-affirming clinician(s) so that shared knowledge of all medications exists across the care team.",

      "title": "What's New in Therapy for Male Androgenetic Alopecia?",
      "abstract": "Male androgenetic alopecia is a common condition and represents a major concern for patients who experience this condition. While there are different treatments to stop hair loss and improve hair density, the 5-alpha reductase inhibitors have demonstrated to be effective in improving androgenetic alopecia in men and can maintain a positive response for many years. Oral finasteride 1 mg is a US FDA-approved option, but dutasteride 0.5 mg has been proven to induce better responses, especially in the frontal area. Both have been shown to be safe in clinical trials but there is widespread concern about sexual adverse effects among patients. The use of topical finasteride has increased during the last few years as a useful option to avoid systemic therapy. The efficacy of topical finasteride 0.25% daily has been demonstrated in clinical trials, with a less marked decrease in serum dihydrotestosterone levels than with oral intake. Mesotherapy with dutasteride has also become more widespread recently, although evidence of its effectiveness is limited to retrospective studies in real clinical practice. The use of oral minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia has not been approved by the FDA, however several clinical studies have shown that it is an effective treatment option. The initial dose recommended to treat male hair loss is 2.5 mg daily, although the dose is frequently increased to 5 mg daily. The main adverse effect of oral minoxidil is hypertrichosis, followed by dizziness or lower limb edema, which are much less common. Platelet-rich plasma is a non-pharmacological option to treat male androgenetic alopecia, with some clinical trials demonstrating an improvement in hair count after several months. Among the published studies, the main limitation to compare its efficacy is the heterogeneity of the procedure. The most frequent regimens propose treatment every 4 weeks for 3 months initially to assess the individual response. Another treatment alternative is the use of light devices with wavelengths of between 630 and 660 nm, known as low-level laser therapy. These devices can be used at home every day for 15-30 min. Their efficacy has been shown in a limited number of clinical trials; however, there is a lack of evidence about the efficacy of these devices compared with other medical options or as a complementary therapy in hair loss. The pipeline of potential new treatments for male androgenetic alopecia is strong. Pyrilutamide and GT20029 are being studied as topical antagonists of the androgen receptor, while cetirizine is another topical option with some initial promising results. Furthermore, according to isolated studies with heterogeneous treatment schemes, the use of botulinum toxin in the scalp might improve androgenetic alopecia, and lastly, scalp threading might increase the total hair count as growth factors are released during implantation.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is a widespread concern in dermatology clinics, affecting both men's and women's quality of life. Hair loss can have many different causes, which are critical to identify in order to provide appropriate treatment. Hair loss can happen due to many variables, such as genetic factors or predisposition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, skin problems, hair growth disorders, poor diet, hormonal problems, certain internal diseases, drug use, stress and depression, cosmetic factors, childbirth, and the chemotherapy process. Treatment for hair loss varies depending on the type of alopecia, deficiency, or excess of structures such as vitamins and minerals, and also on hair and skin structure. The Mediterranean diet is characterized by low amounts of saturated fat, animal protein, and high amounts of unsaturated fat, fiber, polyphenols, and antioxidants. The main nutrients found in the Mediterranean Diet are rich in antioxidant, anti-inflammatory components. It also has an important place in hair loss treatment, since recently treatment strategies have included polyphenols and unsaturated oils more and more frequently. The goal of this work was to review published articles examining alopecia and its types, the many micronutrients that affect alopecia, and the role of the Mediterranean diet in alopecia. The literature shows that little is known about hair loss, nutritional factors, and diet, and that the data collected are conflicting. Given these differences, research into the function of diet and nutrition in the treatment of baldness is a dynamic and growing topic.",

This complex trait is related to aging and genetics; however, multiple other factors, for example, lifestyle, are also involved. Despite its prevalence, the underlying biology of androgenetic alopecia remains elusive, and thus advances in its treatment have been hindered. Herein, we review the functional anatomy of hair follicles and the cell signaling events that play a role in follicle cycling. We also discuss the pathology of androgenetic alopecia and the known molecular mechanisms underlying this condition. Additionally, we describe studies comparing the transcriptional differences in hair follicles between balding and non-balding scalp regions. Given the genetic contribution, we also discuss the most significant risk variants found to be associated with androgenetic alopecia. A more comprehensive understanding of this pathology may be generated through using multi-omics approaches.",

      "abstract": "Topical minoxidil has been used for many years as treatment for different hair disorders. Even though it is an effective therapy, many patients show poor compliance due to the cosmesis, cost and side-effects. During the last few years, low-dose oral minoxidil has proven to be an alternative for patients with alopecia. We performed a literature search including all the articles that used oral minoxidil as a primary treatment in various hair diseases in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose oral minoxidil as an alternative to topical minoxidil. Androgenetic alopecia was the most common studied condition, but others included telogen effluvium, tractional alopecia, postchemotherapy-induced alopecia, monilethrix, loose anagen hair syndrome, alopecia areata and scarring alopecias (frontal fibrosing alopecia and lichen planopilaris). Larger randomized comparative studies including standardized objective measurements should be done in order to clarify the best treatment protocol, including dosage and treatment duration. Oral minoxidil has proven to be a successful and well-tolerated alternative for patients with hair loss, including those with poor adherence to other therapies. Different dosing regimens have been utilized in scarring and non-scarring alopecia, varying from 0.25 to 5 mg daily. Higher doses have not been studied in men or women. Available literature suggests women require lower doses, from 0.25 to 2.5 mg daily, while men require higher doses for maximal efficacy, from 1.25 to 5 mg a day.",

      "abstract": "Finasteride and minoxidil are medicaments commonly prescribed for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPA), hypertension, and/or androgenetic alopecia (AGA). The mechanism of action of finasteride is based on the interference in androgenic pathways, which may lead to fertility-related disorders in men. Minoxidil, however, can act in multiple ways, and there is no consensus that its use can adversely affect male fertility. Since finasteride and minoxidil could be risk factors for male fertility, we aimed to compare their impact on the two reproductive organs testis and epididymis of adult murine models, besides testis/epididymis-related cells, and describe the mechanism of action involved. For such, we used the PRISMA guideline. We included 31 original studies from a structured search on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. For in vivo studies, the bias analysis and the quality of the studies were assessed as described by SYRCLE (Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation). We concluded that finasteride and minoxidil act as hormone disruptors, causing oxidative stress and morphological changes mainly in the testis. Our results also revealed that finasteride treatment could be more harmful to male reproductive health because it was more associated with reproductive injuries, including damage to the epididymis, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and reduced semen volume. Thus, this study contributes to the global understanding of the mechanisms by which medicaments used for alopecia might lead to male reproductive disorders. We hope that our critical analysis expedites clinical research and reduces methodological bias. The registration number on the Prospero platform is CRD42022313347.",

      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is an androgen-dependent hereditary trait resulting in hair miniaturization. It is the most common type of alopecia in men and women. During the last years, multiple treatment modalities have been studied, but only topical minoxidil and finasteride have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Microneedling (MN) is a minimally invasive technique that induces collagen formation, as well as growth factors production and neovascularization. Even though not many studies of MN in alopecia have been performed, it remains a favorable treatment modality; however, no standardized protocol for MN in hair loss has been proposed yet. Current evidence is not sufficient to allow a direct comparison with other therapies, but it shows promises to increase hair density, thickness, and quality of hair, especially when combined with other treatments or when used as a drug delivery system. This article aims to summarize the available literature regarding the use of MN alone or associated with other therapies for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia.",

      "abstract": "Despite a significant increase in reported cases of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) in literature, discussion about the possible role of environmental factors, instruction for diagnosis and guideline for treatment, are limited. The review aims to provide a detailed synthesis of this condition that could be used by clinicians in their practise. Whether single-centre or multi-centre, studies of more than 60 cases less than 5 years old were mainly taken into consideration. Results obtained were that FFA affects mainly postmenopausal Caucasian women; the most common comorbidities are hyperlipidaemia, arterial hypertension, osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, depression, alongside dermatological disorders such as atopic dermatitis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis and androgenetic alopecia. Autoimmune, genetic, hormonal (e.g. estrogen deficiency, pregnancy, lactation, HRT and raloxifene) and environmental (e.g. daily use of facial sunscreens and less frequent use of hair dyes and shampoo) hypotheses were proposed for pathogenesis, as well as association with various predisposing factors (patient's health-social profile, disease's history and comorbidities). Clinical presentation of FFA can be divided into 3 specific patterns, each with a different prognosis. Diagnosis is usually made clinically with the use of trichoscopy; however, scalp biopsy remains the gold standard. The condition is regarded as a variant of lichen planopilaris (LPP) due to the similarity of the prominent histopathological findings, but the clinical image is distinct and therapeutic options vary. 5α-reductase inhibitors, intralesional steroids, and hydroxychloroquine provide the highest level of evidence for the treatment of FFA. The conclusion is that a better understanding of the disease is crucial for proper disease management.",

In our study, we found that miR-221 significantly suppressed hair growth and the proliferation of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) and dermal sheath cells (DSCs) in AGA patients. Interestingly, miR-221 and AR were mainly co-located in the same part of the hair follicle. Mechanistic analysis revealed that AR directly promoted the transcription of miR-221, which in turn suppressed IGF-1 expression, leading to the inactivation of the MAPK pathway in DPCs and the PI3K/AKT pathway in DSCs. In AGA patients, miR-221 expression was positively correlated with AR expression and negatively correlated with IGF-1 expression. Our findings indicate that miR-221, as a direct target of AR, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AGA, making it a novel biomarker and potential therapeutic target for treating AGA.",

      "title": "Efficacy and safety of combinational therapy using topical minoxidil and microneedling for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
      "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia is a widespread condition that is the most common type of hair loss affecting approximately 58% and 40% of men and women by the age of 50, respectively. Patients have been known to experience severe distress due to androgenetic alopecia, including anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the efficacy of combination therapy using topical minoxidil and microneedling compared to topical minoxidil alone. This systematic review of randomized controlled trials was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. The literature search was performed using Scopus, Cochrane, Embase, and the National Institutes of Health's United States National Library of Medicine from inception through January 20, 2023. Randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of combinational therapy and monotherapy using microneedling and minoxidil on patients with clinically diagnosed androgenetic alopecia were included after screening titles, abstracts, and full texts. Two independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and appraised the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Ten randomized controlled trials, including 466 patients, were selected for this review and eight studies were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. All eight studies displayed a statistically significant increase in total hair count [standard mean difference (SMD) 1.76; 95% CI 1.26-2.26; P < 0.00001]; however, the evidence did not support a statistically significant increase in hair diameter (SMD 0.82; 95% CI - 0.01 to 1.65; P = 0.05). No scarring nor serious adverse events were reported in any of the studies. The findings of this meta-analysis strongly support the utilization of a multimodal therapeutic approach of minoxidil and microneedling for hair growth in patients with androgenetic alopecia. However, variations in factors such as rating scale measurements, microneedling methods, and areas of treatment may have resulted in confounding. Further randomized controlled, large-sample trials employing rigorous methodologies are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding regarding treatment efficacy, namely the impact of combinational therapy on hair diameter.Clinical trial registrations This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and is registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database (CRD42023391164) and the International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (INPLASY) database (INPLASY202310031).",

      "abstract": "Testosterone plays a pivotal role in maintaining balance within the multi-dimensional psychological network of mood, behaviour, self-perception and perceived quality of life in men of any age. Apart from classical forms of hypogonadism, low testosterone concentrations can also be seen in older men, described as an age- and comorbidity-driven functional hypogonadism and might relate to depressive symptoms exhibiting a wide array of clinical pictures ranging from dysthymia and fatigue over inertia, listlessness to hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. Also, various traits of anxiety, from unfocussed fear to phobic anxiousness and open panic syndromes, are influenced by testosterone. Correspondingly, anxiolysis is likely to be modulated by testosterone via stress resilience, threat vigilance and reward processing. The steroid modulates pro-active and re-active dimensions of aggression, which has to be seen within the context of gaining or maintaining status. This may also include other strategies impacting the social position: heroic or parochial altruism and non-aggressive paths of assertiveness, such as posture and social vigilance. Independent rather than relationship-associated self-construal and self-esteem influence risk-taking traits under the modulation of testosterone. In addition, the genetic setting of the androgen receptor modulates the role of testosterone in aspects regarding mood and personality. Dimensions of sexuality are rather important in this context, but are not target of this article and covered in another part of this special edition. Overall, the quality of life in older hypogonadal men can be positively influenced by testosterone substitution, as has been demonstrated in large placebo-controlled trials.",

      "abstract": "The use of testosterone therapy has a complex history of apprehension and questions regarding its safety. Despite an eventual consensus that testosterone therapy was safe and effective, several studies relating to cardiovascular risks emerged in the last decade, rekindling skepticism regarding the safety of testosterone therapy. Given the utility of testosterone therapy in treating the symptoms of hypogonadism, it remains crucial to closely examine the safety of testosterone therapy. The present article synthesizes the current evidence regarding cardiovascular risks that may be associated with testosterone therapy, the potential mechanisms regarding testosterone's efficacy, and future directions in evaluating the safety of its use.",

      "abstract": "Testosterone deficiency, or male hypogonadism, is a clinical syndrome that can be defined as persistently low serum testosterone levels in the setting of symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency. Studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy may improve sexual function, depressive symptoms, bone density, and lean body mass. Evidence is conflicting regarding its effect on cardiovascular events and mortality. Although prior studies suggested that testosterone replacement therapy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, a large, randomized trial showed that it does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, even in patients at high risk. After a detailed discussion of the potential benefits and risks through shared decision-making, testosterone replacement therapy should be considered for men with testosterone deficiency to correct selected symptoms and induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics. Treatment method should take into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, potential for medication interactions, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving testosterone replacement therapy for symptom improvement, potential adverse effects, and adherence. Serum testosterone, hematocrit, and prostate-specific antigen levels should be measured at baseline and at least annually in men 40 years or older receiving testosterone replacement therapy.

However, they are difficult to self-administer and associated with some discomfort. Recently, subcutaneous (SC) administration of testosterone esters has gained popularity, as self-administration is easier with this route. Available data, though limited, support the feasibility of this route. Here we review the pharmacokinetics and safety of SC testosterone therapy with both long- and ultralong-acting testosterone esters. In addition, we provide guidance for clinicians on how to counsel and manage their patients who opt for the SC route.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary societies exhibit delayed reproductive age and increased life expectancy. While the male reproductive system demonstrates relatively delayed aging compared to that of females, increasing age substantially impacts its function. A characteristic manifestation is age-induced testosterone decline. Testosterone, a crucial male sex hormone, plays pivotal roles in spermatogenesis and sexual function, and contributes significantly to metabolism, psychology, and cardiovascular health. Aging exerts profound effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and Leydig cells, precipitating testosterone reduction, which adversely affects male health. Exogenous testosterone supplementation can partially ameliorate age-related testosterone deficiency; however, its long-term safety remains contentious. Preserving endogenous testosterone production capacity during the aging process warrants further investigation as a potential intervention strategy.",

      "title": "Detection of clostebol in sports: Accidental doping?",
      "abstract": "The detection of clostebol misuse in sports has been growing recently, especially in Italy, due to the ample availability of pharmaceutical formulations containing clostebol acetate (Trofodermin®) and the use of more sensitive instrumentation by the antidoping laboratories. Most of these cases have been claimed to be related to a nonconscious use of the drug or through contact with relatives or teammates using it. We have investigated, through the application of the well-known and currently used gas chromatographic mass spectrometric procedures, the likelihood of these allegations and have demonstrated that after a single transdermal administration of 5 mg of clostebol acetate and a transient contact with the application area, it is possible to generate adverse analytical findings in antidoping controls. We have reviewed the Phase I and Phase II clostebol metabolism in order to generate evidences that may help the sport authorities reviewing these cases. The main clostebol metabolite (4-chloro-androst-4-en-3α-ol-17-one, M1) generally used at the screening level as well as other three metabolites (M2-M4) are mainly excreted as glucuronides, whereas M5 (4ζ-chloro-5ζ-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) is predominantly excreted as sulfate. Neither the 5α-reductases activity (impaired by the presence of the chlorine in C4) nor specific sulfotransferases present in the skin allowed a clear distinction of the administration route. Studies with a larger number of volunteers and probably investigating another physiological fluid allowed in antidoping such as blood are needed for a deeper investigation. It is not unreasonable to establish a reporting level for M1, maybe creating some false negatives but excluding nonintentional doping scenarios.",

      "title": "The clinical management of testosterone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder: a review.",
      "abstract": "As women age, there is an overall decrease in androgen production due to decline of ovarian and adrenal function during menopause. Androgens have been demonstrated to play an important role in sexual motivation in women. As a result, many postmenopausal women experience Female Sexual Dysfunction (FSD) which are a group of disorders that pertain to sexual arousal, desire, orgasm, and pain. A prevalent manifestation of FSD is Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) or the absence of sexual fantasies, thoughts, and/or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity. There is gaining interest in the use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women. This article reviews the literature on the relationship of androgen decline and HSDD, describes our methodology for evaluation, diagnosis of HSDD, and the use of TRT in treating postmenopausal women with HSDD. Our results conclude that testosterone is a vital hormone in women in maintaining sexual health and function. TRT is an effective treatment option for postmenopausal people with HSDD. There is still limited data on the effectiveness in premenopausal people with HSDD. Further research in the strengths and weaknesses for the long-term effect of TRT in women of all ages is needed.",

      "abstract": "Rates of unplanned pregnancies are high globally, burdening women and families. Efforts to develop male contraceptive agents have been thwarted by unacceptable failure rates, side effects and a dearth of pharmaceutical industry involvement. Hormonal male contraception consists of exogenous androgens which exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and suppress gonadotropin production. This in turn suppresses testicular testosterone production and sperm maturation. Addition of a progestin suppresses spermatogenesis more effectively in men. Contraceptive efficacy studies in couples have shown male hormonal methods are effective and reversible, but also may come with side effects related to sexual desire, acne and serum cholesterol and inconvenient methods of dosing and delivery. Recently, novel androgens as potential contraceptive agents are being evaluated in early clinical trials and look to overcome these drawbacks. Here we summarize landmark studies of prototype male hormonal contraceptives, showcasing recent advances and future prospects in this important area of public health.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated a clear association between T2D, obesity and reduced total testosterone concentration. This relationship becomes less significant or absent with correction for changes in body composition, supporting the notion that changes in body composition are mediating these effects. Moreover, this mediating effect of body composition changes is bi-directional, as evidenced by interventional studies of weight loss and testosterone treatment. On the one hand, in obese men, serum testosterone increases markedly with weight loss. On the other hand, testosterone improves body composition. This relationship is driven by multiple complex interaction between obesity and insulin resistance and the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, at all levels. Data from randomised control trials have demonstrated that intervention with testosterone therapy increases muscle mass and reduces adiposity. Most recently it has been shown that treatment with testosterone prevents progression of impaired glucose tolerance to T2D, or reverses newly diagnosed T2D beyond lifestyle intervention alone. At present there are insufficient safety data to support the use of testosterone for prevention of type 2 diabetes.",

      "title": "Relationships between endogenous and exogenous testosterone and cardiovascular disease in men.",
      "abstract": "In this narrative review, we discuss the evidence about the controversy about the cardiovascular effects of endogenous and exogenous testosterone in men. Prospective cohort studies with follow-up of ~5-15 years generally indicate no association or a possible inverse relationship between serum endogenous testosterone concentrations and composite major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular deaths and overall mortality. Pharmacoepidemiological studies of large databases generally show no association between testosterone therapy and incident major cardiovascular events, and some pharmacoepidemiological studies demonstrate an association with decreased overall mortality. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials indicate that there is no increased incidence of overall major cardiovascular events with 1-3 years of testosterone therapy. These placebo-controlled trials have major limitations including small numbers of participants, short duration of testosterone therapy and follow-up, and lack of systematic adjudication of cardiovascular events. Overall, the evidence indicates that endogenous testosterone concentrations and testosterone therapy at physiological dosages confer no or minimal effects on the incidence of cardiovascular outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to make conclusions about testosterone therapy for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events (e.g., men with recent myocardial infarctions or stroke and men with recurrent idiopathic deep venous thromboses). In general, clinicians should avoid prescribing supraphysiological testosterone therapy to hypogonadal men or men with slightly low to low-normal serum testosterone concentrations and no identified disorder of the hypothalamus-pituitary-testicular axis because of the uncertain cardiovascular risks and the lack of proven health benefits. For most men with bona fide hypogonadism, benefits of testosterone therapy exceed the potential risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.",

A recent study by Yang and colleagues published in this journal addresses the importance of studying sex hormones during critical stages of brain development. The authors demonstrate that exogenous testosterone administered to immature mice pups around the time of sevoflurane exposure increased brain levels of testosterone, attenuated tau phosphorylation, inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3β activation and its interaction/binding with tau, reversed sevoflurane-induced decreases in neuronal activation, and attenuated cognitive impairments. Their well-designed experiments suggest an important role that testosterone plays in balancing several important pathways crucial for neuronal protection and normal function of neuronal circuits in the male mammalian brain.",

      "abstract": "The role of hormones in gut-brain crosstalk is largely elusive, but recent research supports specific changes in hormone levels correlated with the gut microbiota. An interesting but unstudied area in microbial endocrinology is the interplay between the microbiota and sex hormones. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of testosterone and sex on the mouse gut microbiome. We use in vitro experiments to test direct effects of testosterone on bacteria in fecal samples collected from male and female mice pre- and post-puberty. Sex-specific microbial and metabolic differences surrounding puberty are also examined in vivo. We then explore effects of testosterone supplementation in vivo, characterizing microbiota and metabolomes of male and female mice. We detect sex-specific differences in microbiota and associated metabolites of mice post-puberty, but in vitro experiments reveal that testosterone only affects microbiota of fecal samples collected before puberty. Testosterone supplementation in vivo affects gut microbiota and metabolomes in both male and female mice. Taking our results from in vitro and in vivo experiments, we conclude that the shift in the microbiome after puberty is at least partially caused by the higher levels of sex hormones, mainly testosterone, in the host.",

Since prostate is a target organ for androgens and anti-androgenic strategies are used to treat and palliate benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PC), the prevalence of both increases with age, the possible influence of TRT on prostate health becomes highly relevant. The present review summarizes existing data on the associations between endogenous hormone concentrations and prostate growth and concludes that circulating concentrations of androgens do not appear to be associated with the risks of development of BPH or initiation or progression of PC. The explanation for these findings relates to an apparent insensitivity of prostatic tissue to changes of testosterone concentrations within the physiological range.",

      "abstract": "The ratio between the hands' second to the fourth finger (2D:4D) is commonly hypothesized to result from prenatal testosterone. The 2D:4D has also been hypothesized to relate to adult-level testosterone and, more recently, to the testosterone response to a challenging situation. In the present work, we tested these core assumptions. Drawing from, in total, 54 studies and 8077 participants, we investigated whether the 2D:4D is related to adult level testosterone (44 studies), testosterone change (6 studies), and prenatal testosterone (10 studies). We found no evidence of the relationship between the above testosterone types and digit ratios. Furthermore, there was no relationship between testosterone and the right and left 2D:4D, male and female 2D:4D, and the 2D:4D and testosterone measurement (i.e., measured in blood or saliva). However, we found some evidence that prenatal testosterone measured in amniotic fluid (but not cord blood) might be related to the digit ratios-further studies are necessary to validate this observation. In summary, considering the current state of knowledge, any conclusions drawn from the assumption of the digit ratios as the proxy for testosterone (prenatal, adult level, or testosterone change under a challenging situation) warrant great caution.",

      "abstract": "Neuroplasticity or neural plasticity implicates the adaptive potential of the brain in response to extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli. The concept has been utilized in different contexts such as injury and neurological disease. Neuroplasticity mechanisms have been classified into neuroregenerative and function-restoring processes. In the context of injury, neuroplasticity has been defined in three post-injury epochs. Testosterone plays a key yet double-edged role in the regulation of several neuroplasticity alterations. Research has shown that testosterone levels are affected by numerous factors such as age, stress, surgical procedures on gonads, and pharmacological treatments. There is an ongoing debate for testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in aging men; however, TRT is more useful in young individuals with testosterone deficit and more specific subgroups with cognitive dysfunction. Therefore, it is important to pay early attention to testosterone profile and precisely uncover its harms and benefits. In the present review, we discuss the influence of environmental factors, aging, and gender on testosterone-associated alterations in neuroplasticity, as well as the two-sided actions of testosterone in the nervous system. Finally, we provide practical insights for further study of pharmacological treatments for hormonal disorders focusing on restoring neuroplasticity.",

      "abstract": "Testosterone levels decrease as men age. When the testes fail to produce an adequate level of endogenous testosterone, men develop hypogonadism. Although the definition of a low testosterone level varies among guidelines, a serum total testosterone level of less than 300 to 350 ng/dL on two separate morning blood samples is considered a low level. To receive exogenous testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), patients should meet criteria for hypogonadism, which is defined as a low testosterone level and signs or symptoms of hypogonadism. Management discussions should be individualized to address patient needs and goals. Counseling before therapy should include shared decision-making regarding risks, benefits, and expectations. Numerous testosterone formulations are available, ranging from topical gels to intramuscular injections. The choice of formulation depends on factors such as cost and patient preference. Use of TRT is limited by contraindications, adverse effects, and a lack of long-term safety data. Patients receiving this therapy require close monitoring. For patients who wish to avoid use of exogenous hormones, are not candidates for TRT, or are unable to tolerate its adverse effects, several nonhormonal pharmacotherapies are available.",

Preclinical studies suggest complex effects of testosterone on cardiovascular risk by acting on skeletal muscle, cardiomyocytes, vasculature, adipocytes, insulin action, and erythropoiesis. Furthermore, low testosterone has a bi-directional association with cardiometabolic risk. Observational studies have reported worse metabolic profiles in men with organic hypogonadism. However, a consistent association between major cardiovascular events and male hypogonadism has not been established. Hematocrit increases with testosterone therapy; however, most studies do not report an increase in venous thromboembolism risk. Although some observational studies and a small randomized controlled study reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, recent data confirm the medium-term cardiovascular safety of testosterone therapy in middle-aged and older men with low testosterone.",

      "abstract": "Androgens are essential hormones in women. Yet, androgen therapy is understudied and underutilized despite showing improvement in postmenopausal hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Additionally, regulatory concerns have left a significant gap in commercially available testosterone preparations, formulated specifically for women, in most countries. This has led to off-label use of male formulations and compounded therapies which are under-regulated. Beyond HSDD and GSM, testosterone likely influences the brain, breast, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems. These effects are not well studied, and therefore it is difficult to counsel patients on testosterone therapy when used for these endpoints. Ultimately, further study is needed to elucidate these effects, create a fuller picture of the risks and benefits, and encourage product development specifically designed for women.",

      "abstract": "Male production of testosterone is crucial for the development of a wide range of functions. External and internal genitalia formation, secondary sexual characteristics, spermatogenesis, growth velocity, bone mass density, psychosocial maturation, and metabolic and cardiovascular profiles are closely dependent on testosterone exposure. Disorders in androgen production can present during all life-stages, including childhood and adolescence, and testosterone therapy (TT) is in many cases the only treatment that can correct the underlying deficit. TT is controversial in the pediatric population as hypoandrogenism is difficult to classify and diagnose in these age groups, and standardized protocols of treatment and monitorization are still lacking. In pediatric patients, hypogonadism can be central, primary, or a combination of both. Testosterone preparations are typically designed for adults' TT, and providers need to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages of these formulations, especially cognizant of supratherapeutic dosing. Monitoring of testosterone levels in boys on TT should be tailored to the individual patient and based on the anticipated duration of therapy. Although clinical consensus is lacking, an approximation of the current challenges and common practices in pediatric hypoandrogenism could help elucidate the broad spectrum of pathologies that lie behind this single hormone deficiency with wide-ranging implications.",

Bacterial prostatitis is treated with antibiotics; the span of treatment is guided by the duration of symptoms and presence of complications. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is the most common form of prostatitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion with no standardized treatments. Asymptomatic prostatitis does not require treatment and is usually diagnosed incidentally during the workup for other urologic presentations.",

      "abstract": "Bisphenol F (BPF) has gained prominence as an alternative to bisphenol A (BPA) in various manufacturing applications, yet being detected in diverse environments and posed potential public health risk. This research aims to elucidate the putative toxic targets and underlying molecular mechanisms of prostate injury induced by exposure to BPF through multi-level bioinformatics data, integrating network toxicology and molecular docking. Systematically leveraging multilevel databases, we determined 276 targets related to BPF and prostate injury. Subsequent screenings through STRING and Cytoscape tool highlighted 27 key targets, including BCL2, HSP90AA1, MAPK3, ESR1, and CASP3. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses demonstrated enrichment of targets involved in apoptosis, abnormal hormonal activities, as well as cancer-related signal transduction cascades, ligand-receptor interaction networks, and endocrine system signaling pathways. Molecular docking simulations conducted via Autodock corroborated high-affinity binding interaction between BPF and key targets. The results indicate that BPF exposure can contribute to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer and prostatic hyperplastic by modulating apoptosis and proliferation, altering nerve function in blood vessel endothelial cells, and disrupting androgen metabolism. This study offers theoretical underpinnings for comprehending the molecular mechanisms implicated in BPF-elicited prostatic toxicity, while concomitantly establishing foundational framework for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for prostatic injuries related to polycarbonate and epoxy resin plastics incorporated with BPF, as well as environments afflicted by elevated levels of these compounds.",

Purpose To develop an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for clinically significant PCa diagnosis at biparametric MRI using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) features for classification justification. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with histopathologic analysis-proven prostatic lesions who underwent biparametric MRI and biopsy between January 2012 and December 2017. After image annotation by two radiologists, a deep learning model was trained to detect the index lesion; classify PCa, clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥ 7), and benign lesions (eg, prostatitis); and justify classifications using PI-RADS features. Lesion- and patient-based performance were assessed using fivefold cross validation and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical feasibility was tested in a multireader study and by using the external PROSTATEx data set. Statistical evaluation of the multireader study included Mann-Whitney ",

      "abstract": "The prostate is an organ characterized by significant spatial heterogeneity. To better understand its intricate structure and cellular composition, we constructed a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the adult human prostate. Our high-resolution mapping effort identified 253,381 single cells and 34,876 nuclei sampled from 11 patients who underwent radical resection of bladder cancer, which were categorized into 126 unique subpopulations. This work revealed various new cell types in the human prostate and their specific spatial localization. Notably, we discovered four distinct acini, two of which were tightly associated with E-twenty-six transcription factor family (ETS)-fusion-negative prostate cancer. Through the integration of spatial, single-cell and bulk-seq analyses, we propose that two specific luminal cell types could serve as the common origins of prostate cancer. Additionally, our findings suggest that zone-specific fibroblasts may contribute to the observed heterogeneity among luminal cells. This atlas will serve as a valuable reference for studying prostate biology and diseases such as prostate cancer.",

      "abstract": "Urinary tract infections, including cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, and prostatitis, are among the most common diagnoses prompting antibiotic prescribing. The rise in antimicrobial resistance over the past decades has led to the increasing challenge of urinary tract infections because of multidrug-resistant and \"difficult-to-treat resistance\" among Gram-negative bacteria. Recent advances in pharmacotherapy and medical microbiology are modernizing how these urinary tract infections are treated. Advances in pharmacotherapy have included not only the development and approval of novel antibiotics, such as ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/relebactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, cefiderocol, plazomicin, and glycylcyclines, but also the re-examination of the potential role of legacy antibiotics, including older aminoglycosides and tetracyclines. Recent advances in medical microbiology allow phenotypic and molecular mechanism of resistance testing, and thus antibiotic prescribing can be tailored to the mechanism of resistance in the infecting pathogen. Here, we provide a narrative review on the clinical and pre-clinical studies of drugs that can be used for difficult-to-treat resistant Gram-negative bacteria, with a particular focus on data relevant to the urinary tract. We also offer a pragmatic framework for antibiotic selection when encountering urinary tract infections due to difficult-to-treat resistant Gram-negative bacteria based on the organism and its mechanism of resistance.",

      "abstract": "Chronic prostate inflammation in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) correlates with the severity of symptoms. How inflammation contributes to prostate enlargement and/or BPH symptoms and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we utilize a unique transgenic mouse model that mimics chronic non-bacterial prostatitis in men and investigate the impact of inflammation on androgen receptor (AR) in basal prostate stem cells (bPSC) and their differentiation in vivo. We find that inflammation significantly enhances AR levels and activity in bPSC. More importantly, we identify interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) as a crucial regulator of AR in bPSC during inflammation. IL-1RA is one of the top molecules upregulated by inflammation, and inhibiting IL-1RA reverses the enhanced AR activity in organoids derived from inflamed bPSC. Additionally, IL-1RA appears to activate AR by counteracting IL-1α's inhibitory effect. Furthermore, using a lineage tracing model, we observe that inflammation induces bPSC proliferation and differentiation into luminal cells even under castrate conditions, indicating that AR activation driven by inflammation is sufficient to promote bPSC proliferation and differentiation. Taken together, our study uncovers mechanisms through which inflammation modulates AR signaling in bPSC and induces bPSC luminal differentiation that may contribute to prostate hyperplasia.",

      "abstract": "Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) plays a vital role in prostate cancer diagnosis and management. With the increase in use of mpMRI, obtaining the best possible quality images has become a priority. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) was introduced to standardize and optimize patient preparation, scanning techniques, and interpretation. However, the quality of the MRI sequences depends not only on the hardware/software and scanning parameters, but also on patient-related factors. Common patient-related factors include bowel peristalsis, rectal distension, and patient motion. There is currently no consensus regarding the best approaches to address these issues and improve the quality of mpMRI. New evidence has been accrued since the release of PI-RADS, and this review aims to explore the key strategies which aim to improve prostate MRI quality, such as imaging techniques, patient preparation methods, the new Prostate Imaging Quality (PI-QUAL) criteria, and artificial intelligence on prostate MRI quality.",

The complexity of this organ, however, turns treatment into a challenge. In this review, we aim to provide insight into the efficacy of alternative treatments, which are not normally used in conventional medicine, with a particular focus on nutrients. In order to understand why and how nutrition can be beneficial in diseases of the prostate, we give an overview of the known characteristics and features of this organ. Then, we provide a summary of the most prevalent prostate illnesses. Finally, we propose nutrition-based treatment in each of these prostate problems, based on in-depth research concerning its effects in this context, with an emphasis on surgery. Overall, we plead for an upgrade of this form of alternative treatment to a fully recognized mode of therapy for the prostate.",

      "title": "The multifaceted role of the stroma in the healthy prostate and prostate cancer.",
      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is an age-related disease and represents, after lung cancer, the second cause of cancer death in males worldwide. Mortality is due to the metastatic disease, which mainly involves the bones, lungs, and liver. In the last 20 years, the incidence of metastatic PC has increased in Western Countries, and a further increase is expected in the near future, due to the population ageing. Current treatment options, including state of the art cancer immunotherapy, need to be more effective to achieve long-term disease control. The most significant anatomical barrier to overcome to improve the effectiveness of current and newly designed drug strategies consists of the prostatic stroma, in particular the fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix, which are the most abundant components of both the normal and tumor prostatic microenvironment. By weaving a complex communication network with the glandular epithelium, the immune cells, the microbiota, the endothelium, and the nerves, in the healthy prostatic microenvironment, the fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix support organ development and homeostasis. However, during inflammation, ageing and prostate tumorigenesis, they undergo dramatic phenotypic and genotypic changes, which impact on tumor growth and progression and on the development of therapy resistance. Here, we focus on the characteristics and functions of the prostate associated fibroblasts and of the extracellular matrix in health and cancer. We emphasize their roles in shaping tumor behavior and the feasibility of manipulating and/or targeting these stromal components to overcome the limitations of current treatments and to improve precision medicine's chances of success.",

It is variably associated with lower urinary tract symptoms, psychosocial consequences, and sexual dysfunction. Specific test systems or biomarkers for a definitive diagnosis are still not available. The purposes of the basic diagnostic assessment are to determine the individual spectrum of symptoms and to rule out differential diagnoses of pelvic pain. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) like the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) are valuable instruments for the initial diagnostic assessment and to evaluate treatment response. Classification systems like UPOINTS (urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurologic/systemic, tenderness of skeletal muscles, sexual dysfunction) are valuable tools to determine the individual spectrum of symptoms, to guide the adapted diagnostic assessment, and to identify relevant targets for a multimodal and tailored treatment. Close urological monitoring of CP/CPPS patients is usually necessary, especially to minimize the unwarranted use of antibiotics in the case of undulating complaints.",

A detailed search of original articles was conducted via the PubMed-MEDLINE, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Cochrane Library databases in the last 10 years up to 1 May 2021 with the following search string solely or in combination: \"prostate cancer\", \"prostate carcinoma\", \"holmium laser enucleation of the prostate\" and \"HoLEP\". We identified 19 articles to include in our analysis and divided them into six main categories: HoLEP versus open prostatectomy and/or transurethral resection of the prostate in terms of iPCa, oncological and functional outcomes, the role of imaging modalities in detecting iPCa, predictive factors of iPCa, the role of prostate-specific antigen kinetics in detecting iPCa and the management of iPCa after HoLEP. We found that the iPCa after HoLEP rate ranges from 5.64% to 23.3%. Functional and oncological outcomes were reported to be encouraging. Oncological treatment options are available in a wide range.",

New and investigative treatments are currently being studied for their role in the treatment and management of chronic prostatitis, but additional studies are needed to determine their efficacy.",

      "title": "Role of Systematic Biopsy in the Era of Targeted Biopsy: A Review.",
      "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major public health issue, as the second most common cancer and the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men. Many PCa cases are indolent and pose minimal risk, making active surveillance a suitable management approach. However, clinically significant prostate carcinoma (csPCa) can lead to serious health issues, including progression, metastasis, and death. Differentiating between insignificant prostate cancer (inPCa) and csPCa is crucial for determining appropriate treatment. Diagnosis of PCa primarily involves trans-perineal and transrectal systematic biopsies. Systematic transrectal prostate biopsy, which typically collects 10-12 tissue samples, is a standard method, but it can miss csPCa and is associated with some complications. Recent advancements, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted biopsies, have been suggested to improve risk stratification and reduce overtreatment of inPCa and undertreatment of csPCa, thereby enhancing patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. Guided biopsies are increasingly recommended for their ability to better detect high-risk cancers while reducing identification of low-risk cases. MRI-targeted biopsies, especially when used as an initial biopsy in biopsy-naïve patients and those under active surveillance, have become more common. Utilization of MRI-TB alone can decrease septic complications; however, the combining of targeted biopsies with perilesional sampling is recommended for optimal detection of csPCa. Future advancements in imaging and biopsy techniques, including AI-augmented lesion detection and robotic-assisted sampling, promise to further improve the accuracy and effectiveness of PCa detection.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has advanced technically, and recent international cooperation has provided a standardized imaging and reporting system for prostate MRI. Accordingly, prostate MRI has recently been investigated and utilized as a triage tool before biopsy to guide tissue sampling to increase the detection rate of CSC beyond the staging tool for patients in whom PCa was already confirmed on conventional systematic biopsy. Radiologists must understand the current paradigm shift for better PCa diagnosis and management. This article reviewed the recent literature, demonstrating the diagnostic value of pre-biopsy prostate MRI with targeted biopsy and discussed unsolved issues regarding the paradigm shift in the diagnosis of PCa.",

      "abstract": "Infertility is a pressing reproductive health issue in modern society, with male factors accounting for approximately 50% of all cases. However, most research on male infertility has primarily focused on the testis, often ignoring the critical role of the prostate. As the largest male reproductive gland, the prostate plays a vital role in semen quality. Prostatic fluid, a major component of semen, significantly influences sperm function and overall male fertility. Prostatitis, the most common prostate disorder among men, particularly with advancing age, can severely impair reproductive health. This article aims to explore the fundamental physiological functions of the prostate, the etiology of prostatitis, and its impact on sperm health. It also discusses potential treatment strategies for prostatitis. Through this review, we hope to deepen understanding of the prostate's crucial role in male infertility.",

Our objective was to explore online search trends for topics related to men's health and identify information-seeking patterns related to news and media coverage of these topics. We used Google Trends ( http://google.com/trends ) to explore search trends for various search terms related to men's health in the United States over a 5-year period. Search queries provided graphs depicting search volume as a function of time, geographical data, and related topics and queries. Isolated spikes in search volume were further explored to identify a related event. Erectile dysfunction was the most-searched topic over the last 5 years in the United States. Prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia were the second and third most-searched topics, respectively. Other popular topics involved symptoms or pathologies of the testicles and penis. Most topics had relatively stable search volumes, with the exceptions of premature ejaculation and Peyronie's disease. Several observed spikes in search volume were attributable to singular events, mostly in the form of online article publications or social media posts. We believe it may be helpful for providers to stay informed of cultural events relating to medical conditions to anticipate patient concerns.",

      "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common chronic diseases affecting the urinary tract that occurs mainly in men over 40 years of age. Among the natural therapies, proanthocyanidins (PACs), which can treat a wide range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), have been shown to play an important role in the treatment of pathologies concerning prostate health. In this regard, the present study aimed to evaluate the different bioactivities of a grape seed extract (GSE), rich in polymeric PACs, and its version processed under alkaline conditions (ATGSE), characterized by a higher content of oligomeric PACs, in an animal model of BPH induced by subcutaneous injection of testosterone (1 mg/mouse).",

The concept of urinary sterility has long been dismissed and now we strive for deciphering various microbial signatures associated with a disease. A dysbalance of the microbiome appears to have a substantial impact on the pathogenesis of both malignant and benign conditions. Novel preventive and therapeutic approaches and biomarker systems have been proposed for prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma and bladder cancer based on microbiome analyses. The exclusion of a microbial origin was always part of the diagnosis of benign disorders such as interstitial cystitis, urinary urge incontinence or chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Now we are certain that an imbalanced microbial profile plays an essential role for the pathogenesis and disease management of these challenging conditions.",

      "abstract": "Parabens are chemicals used as preservatives in food, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals. Detectable paraben levels are found in water, air, and soil, making human and animal exposure unavoidable. This study evaluated the effects of methylparaben, propylparaben, and their mixture on the prostate and gonads of male and female gerbils. Gerbils aged 90 days were assigned to the groups: (M) 10 mg/kg/day of methylparaben; (P) 10 mg/kg/day of propylparaben; (M + P) 5 mg/kg/day of methylparaben plus 5 mg/kg/day of propylparaben; (C) control group. The animals were treated orally for 30 consecutive days, and the prostates and gonads were subjected to morphometric-stereological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses. The male ventral prostates in the P and M + P groups showed an increase in relative weight, higher cell proliferation, besides the occurrence of hyperplasia and epithelial desquamation. All treatments reduced malondialdehyde levels in the male prostate. The female prostate exhibited alterations in all treated groups, but with greater severity in the P and M + P groups. These alterations included increased cell proliferation and epithelial hyperplasia, as well as stromal inflammatory foci and increased secretory activity. M, P, and M + P reduced the diameter of the seminiferous tubules, the thickness of the germinal epithelium, and the catalase activity in the testes. In the ovaries, P and M + P reduced the primary follicle number and increased the superoxide dismutase activity. These results indicate that propylparaben is more harmful to the prostate and gonads than methylparaben, and that the acceptable daily intake for these parabens is not safe for reproductive health.",

Pathological reclassification was determined by the Gleason Grade Group (GG). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and logistic regression (LR) models were used to evaluate the predictive performance of predictors. In clinically low-risk patients with biopsy GG ≤2, phi (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.14-2.82, P = 0.01) and its derivative phi density (PHID; OR = 2.34, 95% CI: 1.30-4.20, P = 0.005) were significantly associated with upgrading to GG ≥3 after RP, and the results were confirmed by multivariable analysis. Similar results were observed in patients with biopsy GG of 1 for the prediction of upgrading to RP GG≥2. Compared to the base model (AUC = 0.59), addition of the phi or PHID could provide additional predictive value for GS upgrading in low-risk patients (AUC = 0.69 and 0.71, respectively, both P < 0.05). In conclusion, phi and PHID could predict GS upgrading after RP in clinically low-risk patients.",

To understand the biological underpinnings of tumor visibility on mpMRI, we examined the proteomes of forty clinically significant tumors (i.e., International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group 2)-twenty mpMRI-visible and twenty mpMRI-invisible, with matched histologically normal prostate. Normal prostate tissue was indistinguishable between patients with visible and invisible tumors, and invisible tumors closely resembled the normal prostate. These data indicate that mpMRI-visibility arises when tumor evolution leads to large-magnitude proteomic divergences from histologically normal prostate.",
